20200311	1	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT #CloseTheSchools

20200311	1	waiting until we have the first case of Covid-19 in the @NYCSchools is the height of stupidity! @NYCMayor should close the schools now, before anyone tests positive and spreads it through their school and on the buses/subways.  #CoronavirusOutbreak #CloseTheSchools

20200313	1	With all the money we GIVE schools,  you'd think they would put hand sanitizer stations throughout the schools (entrances, exits, cafeterias, outside areas). I'm sure superintendent can make that happen. #handsanitizer #BrowardCounty #school #Covid19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #schools

20200629	1	@GavinWilliamson @BBCBreakfast Wholly unreassured by you this morning. Bubbles don’t protect children or their families they just make it easier for you to track and isolate those who catch it but by then it’s too late for those kids and their families. #schools
20200629	1	@GavinWilliamson @BBCBreakfast you talk about no social distancing, just reducing vectors for disease in schools well in autumn with closed windows and a 50 minute lesson all that’s irrelevant when an infected kid coughs in the classroom my daughter is sharing. #schools

20200629	1	I want to be excited by the announcement that crumbling schools will be rebuilt - I really do. But I can’t help feeling like it’s just a huge PR spin distraction. If you really cared about schools and education, you’d have invested in them a long time ago #schools
20200629	1	Is it really safe for our children to go back to school when private schools are still closed & offering online learning? Why are non residential private schools still closed if it is safe for the lower end of economic society’s children to back to school #education #schools
20200629	1	More dithering and delay tactics from @GavinWilliamson on @BBCBreakfast about govt approach to ensuring all pupils can return safely in Sept "  unacceptable procrastination and no sign of clarity for schools and parents..#schools

20200630	1	The concept of green schools is intriguing.  Growing up, my school used all of its physical attributes to teach us about nature. But this stopped after the 5th grade, when everything became bookish.  Have you had lessons in gardens and under trees?  #nature #teaching #schools
20200630	1	The talk of "relaxing planning regulations" to push through infrastructure agenda with no talk of sustainability is really troubling. It's not recovery OR sustainability. We must do both. Don't be distracted by big, shiny gestures.   #borishasfailedtheuk #ukhousing #schools

20200701	1	As a mother of 4, I do too. We must reopen schools normally! No distancing, no masks, no isolation from cafeterias, PE, recess, extracurricular activities! It is wrong & selfish to allow the powerful teachers unions to arbitrarily decide this! #ReopeningSchools #ReopeningSchools
20200701	1	But we didn't build Nightingale Hospitals; we used existing buildings and then had nobody to staff them.   Most schools don't have the space for temporary classrooms & certainly don't have spare teachers or the funds to employ them.   #schools

20200707	1	Hoping that schools will reopen this fall and bring back students in person. Social aspect of school is extremely important. Of course, will need to find ways to protect vulnerable teachers/household members. Educators perform an essential service. #COVIDー19 #SchoolReopening

20200707	1	If y’all wanted your kids back in school you shouldve socially distanced and worn masks but instead you vacationed and ignored this pandemic. Now we all have to reap what you’ve sewn. Be prepared to homeschool again. #SchoolReopening

20200707	1	No KCPE , KCSE for this year 2020. Schools to reopen next year,  candidates to repeat classes.  #SchoolReopening
20200707	1	Putting “kids at risk” by reopening schools goes against data showing low impact to kids and is fear mongering.  We should be honest that the elderly are the ones at risk and we want to protect them, versus continue to confuse the public and erode their trust.  #SchoolReopening
20200707	1	So the government is sending more teachers back to school. The people who earn such low wages for educating the masses. This is beyond dumb. Teachers and children will die from this virus and it will be the governments fault.  #SchoolReopening
20200707	1	So they’re pretty much banking on no one getting sick. Good plan, #SFUSD.   #SchoolReopening

20200708	1	Anyone opening the schools in a pandemic has clearly never worked in an elementary school classroom. One child in a 30 student Classroom is ill and the teacher and 60%+ students become ill. It must be online with hospital level protocol for the actual buildings #schools
20200708	1	Anyone who thinks elementary school children will be able to social distance and keep masks on all day has never dealt with small children. And what about in the cafeteria? None of this makes any sense. #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	As far as I'm concerned, schools can reopen after  @realDonaldTrump spends a month as an elementary school substitute teacher --in a small, enclosed room for several hrs per day w/25 (unscreened, untested) students-- and declares it is safe. #reopening #ReopeningSchools

20200708	1	Hmm. He mentioned dads, moms, and kids, but a very important group of people were left out of his *assinine and idiotic* statement. It’s not as if children are in schools alone. There are adults with them. Say their names. Ask them what THEY want. #teachers #education #schools

20200708	1	I also love how these RWNJs use the freaking military as a model for everything(e.g, police)  I honor those who serve and want them to be protected, too. But they are adults who signed up for life-threatening work. =/= schoolkids and teachers, you awful cretins! #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	I was a teacher & although many are good, a lot of them relish in their easy yearly schedule  and many don’t want to go back into the classroom setting. Why would they when they can sit at home and teach a few minutes a day on a Zoom call ? #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	I was a teacher for 34 years. Education is important, but it is NOT more important than the health and safety of students. Parents and grandparents, do NOT lay your children on the altar of Trump, so he can save the almighty economy. #backtoschool #SchoolReopening

20200708	1	It's time parents put pressure on the president to not open the schools in this pandemic it's not safe for prisoners, or nursing homes but he thinks kids will be safe! #covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	I’m all for kids going back to school in the fall but not because Trump says so. We need scientists and doctors to tell us that it’s okay. Nobody wants kids back in school more than parents who actually parent their kids.   #COVID #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Let Me Shorten It For You: @JoeBiden Is Doing The Right Thing In Regards To #SchoolReopening!  #COVID19 #KidsLivesMatter #ReopeningSchools
20200708	1	May work if every man, woman and child wear a mask, social distance , all summer. Remember, #Trump has thousands of children in cages, with no remorse so he may care little about kids welfare in school.   #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	No we don’t- from a dad. #TrumpIsUnwell #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Nor @SecAzar! The man has shown himself to be a sycophantic imbecile who should never hold a position of public trust.  #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Not sending my kids to school here in Michigan unless we have a vaccine. My kids will not have 'killing their grandmother' on their conscience.  Kids are disgusting creatures, you think they will practice any of the #COVID19 things school will be implementing.  #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	ORDERING someone to risk their life will not enhance morale.  Assuring educators & parents that EVERY resource will be used to put health & safety FIRST will get more buy-in from stakeholders.  A modified model may be our best bet for opening schools safely.  #SchoolReopening

20200708	1	Please explain to me how Trump plans on opening schools this fall when classes are already at capacity. I'm just a little confused. #COVID19 #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	President Trump, VP Mike Pence and first lady Melania Trump participate in a discussion on reopening schools. #trump #Melania #ReopeningSchools
20200708	1	School rewards memory through examination, while life rewards imagination through effort. Find it profitable to get the best of both.... in moderation!!#SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Should students wear uniforms while attending #OnlineClasses? #schools
20200708	1	So I assume you are planning to be in a classroom every single day. All day. Interacting with students, teachers, admin staff, lunchroom staff, yard duty staff.  Without a mask.  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	So are all these people who don’t want to open schools admitting that school at home is better than brick& mortar school? Because they sure don’t want kids to go back to regular school. #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	So it makes sense to keep schools closed until COVID19 cases start a steady decline.  Thanks Tucker! For once we agree!  #COVID19 #schools
20200708	1	Speaking of Norway:  The US had 60,000 new cases yesterday.  Norway had 11.  ELEVEN!  #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Still unsure what the guidelines are for this coming school year here in FL. I will be new to the public school system, so I have not been sent any communication yet. Anyone heard anything yet?  #Florida #teachertwitter #edutwitter #teaching #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening

20200708	1	The GOP used to be in favor of local control. Schools in America have been historically under the control of locally elected boards of education.Trump and DeVos have no business telling schools how to operate. Another example how Trump is not a true conservative.#SchoolReopening
20200708	1	The government didn’t care about children being left behind by schooling before the pandemic. Stop pretending you do now. #schools
20200708	1	This can/should be done cautiously, and learning as we go, but we already know how important early schooling is - it hasn’t stopped being important bc of COVID, and it should be our top reopening priority. (And special ed). 3/3 #schoolsbeforebars #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	This pandemic is not going away and forcing parents to send their children to school will go down in history as the sickest thing the GOP has ever done to the American people.... So many more will die as a result of this. This is insane. #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Trump and Devos “we only lost 130k people it coulda been 2 million, y’all lil bastards all need to be in school 5 days a week in September!” #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Trump doesn't care about teachers, school administrators, students  Instead of coming up with a plan, he tweets. Tweeting is not governing. Working with the teachers union to open schools safely is common sense. Something lacking in the Trump administration. #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Welcome to education.  They literally mute you. Teachers get zero say in any decision making. #SchoolReopening https://twitter.com/jinglebayls/status/1280297315421618176…
20200708	1	What about all the kids that live with their grandparents? #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	What about the teachers?  #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Why does Trump think that people would only keep schools closed to make him look bad? Maybe, just maybe, people are concerned about kids getting sick. #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	Yeah, but will they offer their children up as Tributes to the Economy?     #AmericaOrTrump #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	You can't cut funding to schools. The budget is in, and the House won't let you. All those countries did it right -- stayed shut down until cases were back to baseline. You wouldn't let us do that, now we're all in trouble. Please just STFU. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200708	1	You shouldn’t force schools to open.  It should be state by state, county by county and a hybrid in class/on line #ReopeningSchools
20200708	2	It's a flu, get over yourself!  Take #Hydroxycloroquine if you're worried.  #OpenSchools
20200709	0	Considering the younger population is much less impacted by the virus, there really isn’t a reason to keep schools closed. Plus, a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics encourages “having students physically present in school.” #OpenSchools
20200709	0	If K-12 schools don’t open, why do I have to pay for 70% of my property taxes when I will essentially be teaching my own children. Sorry, but watching YouTube videos & answering questions are not teaching/learning. #OpenSchools
20200709	0	If schools don't open this fall, can we just drop the kids off at Walmart for 7 hours? #OpenSchools
20200709	0	Schools need to go back! Keeping them closed causes parents to stay away from work to homeschool their kids. It holds back the entire economy, and by the way, kids don't die from this disease!  #OpenSchools
20200709	0	Schools need to reopen in some form here in the fall. If for no other reason than for many of our students we are the most responsible and dependable adults they will see all day.  #OpenSchools
20200709	0	Why is opening schools a political issue now? Families of kids with special needs are really struggling without school or in person services. Zoom makes my son’s sensory issues worse. Do ye want to come over and hold him while he screams? That’s the reality of it. #OpenSchools
20200709	1	#Benin2020 seems to be a idelogy, well, lets wait and see follow4follow #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	@VP I'm sorry but every parent will rather have tough guidelines to reopen schools vs. lax. These are people's kids you are talking about. It's one thing to tell adults to put themselves at risk But when you  talking about kid's you're going a bridge to far. #ReopeningSchools

20200709	1	@realDonaldTrump are we sending your kid back to school with the same protections as everyone else?  Or did you forget you have a kid because you're a failure just like #Fredtrump always said you were.  #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	@realDonaldTrump is pathetic. America is suffering due to your failure to show leadership in handling #COVID19, #racialequity, #Policereform, #economicrecovery #diplomacy #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	@realDonaldTrump is pressureing schools into reopening , @GovRonDeSantis doing the same. This is an issue best left up to local governments.   #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	@realDonaldTrump, if I had kids, there's no way in Hell I'd let them go back to school. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	After @realDonaldTrump spends at least a month as an elementary school substitute teacher --in a small, enclosed room for several hrs per day w/25 (unscreened, untested) students-- and declares it is safe, then we can talk about #schoolsreopening.  #ReopenSchools #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Along with every Republican congressman’s, Senators’ & Adminsitration staff ‘s children ...  Let them show their confidence in sending kids back to public school by sending their own kids. No more private tutors or private schools for the @GOP elite   #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Alot of students want school resumption not because they want but, because they are tired of staying at home  #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Also, keep in mind that Trump repeatedly undercuts his cabinet secretaries/administration officials. They say one thing, he often says another.  #COVID19 #schools
20200709	1	And here’s the thing, rich kids will “find a way” to not head into the classroom. They will be private/on line schooled with public money (thank you DeVos) leaving public ed stripped of resources and festering as one big disease...  #OpenSchools #COVID19 #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Arguments for reopening schools: 1) kids will starve or suffer domestic abuse if they stay home. 2) people can't work if kids aren't warehoused in schools.   Do we value education? We are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable. We are failing. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	As a country we need to decide quickly what is more important to us: active social lives or our kids returning to school. We can’t have both so which are we willing to sacrifice? #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Barely have the words to express how much I feel for those of you with school-age kids rn.  As hard as this has been for everyone, we haven't all been faced with same decisions.  I am so sorry. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Barron #trump prestigious school is still deciding on what the fall semester will look like for students.  St. Andrews might offer a mix of on and off-campus learning, which is precisely what the Trump administration says is not acceptable #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Before anyone, anywhere plans how we will OPEN schools, can someone assess impact of distance learning over the internet, especially in poor and Black/Latino communities?  How was "attendance"?  Was instruction possible?  What were the ups and the downs of it?  #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	CHILDREN SCHMILDREN! YES! #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Children are not allowed in school if they have a contagious disease.  Letters are sent home informing parents. Just in case. Asymptomatic covid Could quickly infect the entire school. Then the community. It is foolish to contemplate opening until testing is in place. #NotMyChild
20200709	1	Could someone explain to me how opening schools will help the economy??? #COVIDIOT #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Countries and businesses are resuming, so are companies. So it's either we pause our lives or live following the health care instructions, while living. #SchoolReopening #schools
20200709	1	Damn.Trump doesn't care about anything.What matters is the health of students,teachers and other school employees,all people.There's no harm in opening a school after a while.Lessons can be recouped but a deceased person cannot return.#SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Did the man who put together an online university just say learning by computers is not as good as learning in the classroom?? @realDonaldTrump #TrumpUniversity #COVIDー19 #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Fact: @realDonaldTrump is like a parent or teacher who can’t back up his tough talk. Everyone knows he will fold in the end...especially because he can’t unilaterally withhold funding to public schools for not re-opening. #IdiotInChief #idiots #coronavirus #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Good because the @CDCgov is already treading water with public trust. I have had enough of Dr. Birx coddling the president for a lifetime. Life is hard, we don’t just quit. If restrictions are too hard to successfully reopen schools maybe we should not be #ReopeningSchools

20200709	1	I have no clue why we are having discussions about starting school. Not every teacher is in a tiny classroom but really it just takes one asymptomatic kid to go into one classroom and it’s all downhill from there. We need to use facts and data to determine #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	I have no words for the people who STILL support Trump after he openly said he will cut funding from schools who don't feel comfortable reopening during a pandemic #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	I pray for wisdom and the move of God over the decision to make with our schools this fall. Our children, teachers, and administrators are not political pawns. #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	I'd be curious to know what the safety measures are for the Baron's school or the school for Ivanka's children.  Do you think they have the same safety measure as the public schools that my two kids go to?  #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	If Trump is as correct about children returning to school in the Fall as he was about that White Pill therapeutic that begins with an H—then I expect the MSM will be equally wrong in their fervent condemnation of him now as they also were then. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	If my child was still in #school, I'd live in a tent & educate him at home before sending him to school placing him, his #teachers & staff, & myself at risk.  #Parents decide. #Cyber school, #homeschooling, a hybrid...options. No parent should feel pressured. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	If they open schools, they better pay us hazard pay, we are putting students, their families, our families, ourselves at risk, we are only given a certain amount of sick days for the school year & finding subs is difficult, especially when they don’t teach. #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	In covid times being it's impossible to distance littles We really to stop procrastinating on important issues me included I'm mad at myself for for not demanding it while my kids were little We need to listen to our teachers they tend to know what's needed. #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	It is but no parent wants to send them to school if it's going to be unsafe #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	I’m tired of watching children shows/movies. I’m tired of listening to children’s music. I’m tired of not being able to take care of me and having alone time. I’m tired of taking care of a little human being. But I would not dare send her back to school...#SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Just in case y’all didn’t know Trump doesn’t have the ability to cut funding to schools. He is once again talking out his ass.... I wonder  if he actually believes this stuff or if he truly doesn’t even know what he’s able to do as President. #SchoolReopening #schools
20200709	1	Just one day after announcing that they would be doing remote learning until further notice, the Laredo school districts (all districts in TX) were told that funding would be revoked if they didn’t offer face-to-face classes. I am disgusted. #covid #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Just putting it out there that Trump wants to defund and close schools that are *reads notes* already closed due to Covid. #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	Keep the government schools closed! Forget that, shut them down for good. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	My kid goes back to school when Manafort goes back to prison. End of story. #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Not a a parent, teacher or govt official but wondering...  Obviously not possible everywhere or every day but...  Could they hold some k-12 classes outdoors in the fall?   Or use arenas and stadiums so students can spread out?  #SchoolReopening #schools
20200709	1	Not everyone can home school some of us actually have to work.....none of us want our kids getting sick so we as parents have to take the necessary precautions also the schools have to have the necessary PPE...but either way they have to open schools.#SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Now that Trump* is actively trying to hurt your children, any of you MAGAts gonna wake up? #schools
20200709	1	Of course that’s true. But how are you going to support schools & teachers? Have you ever been in a public school with 30 kids packed in a classroom? You people are delusional! If you focused on reality & a national plan we might be able to go to school & work. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Of course you don't know about the lives lost because of that damn mask you're not wearing.Who knows?Because of the mask you're not wearing,who was infected with the virus and became deadly. And what about Trump,who still plans to open schools?#WearADamnMask #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	One must also question the rapid speed in which ventilators are manufactured during this period! Will it be of high quality & therefore effective? Or is it just a matter of "well the supply is there"! Time will tell. #COVID19inSA #CoronaVirusSA #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	One of the WH guidelines to open schools is to have windows open. How do you do this if the building has no windows? There are dumb people in powerful positions in the country. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Online is and should only be supplemental. Right now kids are being manipulated and used for political gain. The left will stop at nothing. Kids want to learn. But kids need structure AND “Kids need kids.” #GoBackToSchool! #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Open the schools, get the students back to a normal schedule. Then get started in reforming the broken education system by getting rid of common core. #SchoolReopening #OpenTheSchools #StudentsLivesMatters #schools
20200709	1	Opening the schools ... great but What kind of environment are we talking about?  A replica of the CCP model?  #OpenSchools
20200709	1	Our Tembisa Team registered 115 vehicles and issued 34 stickers to scholar transport in Benoni today #COVID__19 #FlattenTheCurve @JacobMamaboloSA @GPDRT_ @OUTPointsmenPta @TrafficFreeflow #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	PLEASE delay school opening in counties with high or increasing infection rates. There is too much unknown about this virus to open with any confidence. Children cannot be put at risk! @MayorMemphis @ShelbyTNHealth @germantowntenn #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Parks and summer school sports in many places still have closed bathrooms and drinking fountains. Are we to believe in a few weeks that will no longer be the case and school can open as usual? That doesn't make sense. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Pence is stating that the risk to children is very low, echoed by Redfield. OK, how likely are children to become carriers?  Will they bring it home (to at-risk members) - would that make children the source of outbreaks when schools re-open?  #schoolsreopening #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	Pence just said: if you can’t open schools following the CDC guidelines then just open without them because opening is what matters. #teacherlife #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	Pence says It’s time for us to get our kids back to school virus or not here we go. This is sheer lunacy. I don’t care if the plane hasn’t landed I’m getting out. Toddler has compared the situation with Germany & Norway. How does that compute? FFS #Trump #Pence #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Private school teachers: what are your schools' plans for reopening? #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Question for #BetsyDeVos: if American schools open but no one shows up, do they keep their funding? #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Question: If students go to school on the "A Day B Day" schedule....2 days a week...does that mean Virus takes those 2 days off? #schoolsreopening #schools
20200709	1	REOPENING SCHOOLS IS BULLSH** WE DON'T WANT TO SIT IN A CHAIR LISTENING TO OUR TEACHERS YELL AT US L! #ReopeningSchools

20200709	1	Schools in our Country Should not be opened till October.The #Indiangovernment Should think on it because Youths are the future of our nation  Lastly, It's my humble request to think on this matter #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Schools may not reopen in fall if COVID19 cases continue to rise, testing does not improve, and necessary funds are not made available. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Schools need to watch the court systems to a possible similar scenario to what opened schools will look like.  Crowded hallways, people with masks mixed with people not wearing them, going into enclosed rooms with a/c and such. #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Schools still can’t control lice outbreaks every single year but I’m sure this is gonna be totally fine. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Schools won’t need funding if they are not in session. #OpenSchools
20200709	1	Screw him. Districts are not going to jump because of Trumps political whims. For @realDonaldTrump to withhold Federal money for those school districts who don't comply with him is more BLACKMAIL just like it was with supplying governors with #PPE #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Since we are already making changes to the 20/21 school year, let’s also make a commitment to discontinue the use of the word “kiddo”. Just an idea  #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	So I'm seeing this chidera tweet and how everyone is talking about African parents always hitting their children. Tbh that's the least..Some african parents not only cause physical injury but emotionally too.. I read something online that I'd like to share. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	So it's Thursday and i thought i should do some throw back for #ThrowbackThursday with some of my games i played (both won and lost ) recently. And while i am doing that i would be sharing the 1k recharge cards as promised. So here goes nothing. #PowerTachaIsBack #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	So many tried to give @POTUS the benefit of the doubt and look where we are! Now yr willing to put other people's children at risk w. No Real Plan! Is #barontrump going to be out there too, or is he getting homeschooled? #potus #COVID19 #coronavirus #school #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	So the White House is saying that the @cdc guidelines for school reopenings are too restrictive! The White House is putting out their own guidelines. #Insane #SaferAtHome #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	So, Democrats are for open borders and Republicans are for open schools. Which one kills more people this school year? #Resist #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Some of us don't get to collect money from our parents except with the "I want to buy textbook" lie  #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Sorry, but I am not risking my kid getting something at school and then bringing it home to our house where my elderly mum in law lives with us so that Trump can look good.  #COVID__19 #COVIDIOTS #coronavirus #school #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	The Federal Government has announced that schools under its control will not be reopening for the forthcoming West African Examination Council (WAEC) exams. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	The First Lady wore $700 5-inch Louboutin stilettos  to a panel on reopening schools safely yesterday, and I need to figure out how to sew or spend my own money on a mask. Check  #ReopenSchools #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	The opening of schools should not be politicized, should not be used as a tipping point to loosen CDC guildelines, should not be threatened with loss of funds for trying to keep students, staff, and the community safe. I’m livid over this. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	The pandemic gave Nigerian students schooling in public schools extra year so bad #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	The people who don’t want the schools to reopen are probably working from home, not to mention they are probably the ones who send their children to school while having the flu and give it to other kids. #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	The ppl who say you can't compare USA & Europe regarding gun control & healthcare now use Europe as an excuse for opening up  It might be just me, but I do believe words like ignorant, hypocrisy & moronic are fitting  They clearly need education though.. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Theirs a reason why we have winter break. In #schools
20200709	1	Think about the people refusing to wear masks right now. Some of those people more than likely have children.  These people will most likely tell their kids to refuse to wear masks in school. #ReopeningSchools

20200709	1	Those worries about restarting  the economy and opening schools is a little like pushing for the dinning room to reopen on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg! #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	To all the parents who’ve been saying how hard home schooling is & how much they now appreciate their children’s teachers, now is the time for you to take a stand on behalf of those teachers! They should not be forced to go to work with COVID-19 cases spiking!! #ReopeningSchools
20200709	1	To put it more clearly, I’m attending online classes during the fall and I hope my daughters school is able to continue distance learning for the children’s safety. I just hope I’m able to work my job from home somehow because Ill still want my income of course. #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	Today working parents, kids, and teachers are the shit Trump throws into the fan   Thanks for thinking of us  #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Watching @CDCgov director #Redfield evade answering questions on @GMA, is clear that he's afraid of #Trump. He can't answer questions from @GStephanopoulos. He needs to resign now and take his Trump politispeak with him.  #coronavirus #COVID #thursdaymorning #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	We are suppose to be social distancing. How the hell do you do that with #ReopeningSchools  Kids can spread #COVIDー19 among themselves. Teacher may fall sick. It may be passed on the there families, including the elderly. No thought has gone into this. #schoolsreopening #schools
20200709	1	We must be talking about @BetsyDeVosED . 90% of teachers gave up on their students, give me a break. Her sole goal is to privatize education. #teachertwitter #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	We need teacher input in the reopening of schools. Their knowledge of the practicalities of their work day & the educational, physical, & emotional needs of their students are invaluable. We risk putting together an ill-informed & impractical response otherwise. #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	Yes she of the no gays allowed art camp. Will she be going back? Will Barron? Will Ivanka, DJTJ & Eric's kids? Best way to reopen schools is to get saturation of virus in community way down, like they've done in every other freaking country #mikepence #COVID #schools
20200709	1	You are such an idiot. You realize these are YOUR guidelines too??? #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #SchoolReopening
20200709	1	You know, those countries that have schools open. Not only are their cases way low. But they’re actually ensuring schools are safe for students & have implemented C19 mitigation protocols. It’s likely most US schools won’t have these safety measures. #SchoolReopening

20200709	1	they really gonna open schools back up when there is a virus spreading that we don't know the cure to. #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening

20200710	1	Here's an idea @BetsyDeVosED ! All politicians volunteer in schools at least one day a week this year to offset costs during a #COVID19 outbreak & teachers/staff are sick/quarantining. Might show how different schools are from #HomeDepot @RonDeSantisFL #SchoolReopening
20200710	1	Honest Question - Looking for serious answers or explanations.  Protesting your political beliefs & fighting against Police Brutality in mass is “worth risking COVID”  But educating America’s future/ our children is not “worth risking COVID”?  #HomeDepot #SchoolReopening
20200710	1	How are the kids in school going to social distance while doing active shooter drills? Will masks be required then? Our guidelines only say masks required in the halls. It is shameful what our kids are going to endure this year. #SchoolReopening
20200710	1	How are we to educate our students when half of them were missing because of illness. Our education system has been underfunded and ignored. You talk of going back to school, but give us a better platform to do this on. #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools

20200710	1	If I wear a mask while teaching VCE students, I don't know how I'm supposed to speak clearly. Moreover, I expect that many parents will keep their kids home. Remote teaching is optimal right now, more than it ever has been. #CloseTheSchools

20200710	1	Leave that decision  to the health professionals. And provide schools with funds so they can help families who wish to send their kids because they have to work and also the families who decide not too. They will need more teachers to accommodate everyone.   #SchoolReopening
20200710	1	Let's get this straight :  Teachers are paid NEXT TO NOTHING to educate our children.  And now we're telling them to CONTINUE being paid NEXT TO NOTHING to risk their LIVES educating our children.  #pandemic #schoolsreopening #realDonaldTrump #COVID #TeachersLivesMatter #schools

20200710	1	Republicans want to send your kids to school to die in a pandemic hoping you won’t realize ahead of time that they don’t care if your kids live or die as long as reopening schools makes it appear as if they did a good job at fighting the pandemic when they didn’t #SchoolReopening
20200710	1	Right now there’s a mom who is choosing the larger Nestle water to get the Box Tops for the extra 10 cents her kids’ school can use towards buying more Expo markers, but sure, please continue to argue about fictional funds schools have to open safely. #SchoolReopening

20200710	1	These MFkrs honestly on tv being interviewed and sh^t tryna tell y’all that the local elementary school is gone handle #COVID19 good enough so you and your kids won’t get sick and die.  The same MFkrs that cain’t send your kids home with the right coat.  #ReopeningSchools
20200710	1	They'll have all the testing ready for all of the pro athletes, but none of that will be there for the students or school employees. As an "older" teacher I'm certainly more at risk than some of our younger staff and my students. Am I just expendable? #SchoolReopening

20200710	2	I’m not sure what the right answer is on schools opening.  We need a better debate than privileged people and/or those with no school age children adamantly against it vs. an incompetent president blindly pushing for it.  #OpenSchools
20200711	0	@LJ4fcps schools should be opened in the fall.  #OpenSchools
20200711	0	Our children are suffering and dying, but it’s not from Covid-19.  It is from the lockdowns, malnutrition, anxiety disorders, child abuse and social isolation.    There is absolutely no scientific reason for schools not to reopen immediately.    #OpenSchools
20200711	0	School closings affect poor & POC who can’t afford private schools, tutors & daycare. If you care about education you should demand that schools open or give vouchers for daycare, tutors or private schools. Not all kids learn online not all parents can help. #OpenSchools
20200711	0	There is no substitute for human interaction, @murray_nyc    Virtual learning certainly has some benefits, but students are not getting certain things from virtual learning. Combine that with social isolation and the impact that has on kids.   #OpenSchools

20200711	1	Detroit Public Schools are opening MONDAY!   I understand that COVID-19, has widened the opportunity gap for children in low-income communities, however I do not think opening schools is the correct way to address the problem.  #Detroit #education #schools
20200711	1	Educators: What are your thoughts about schools reopening? I would love to hear/discuss what your views are. Does your district have a plan? Many of you may be parents yourself...how are you feeling about your child in this environment? Thoughts? I want to hear! #ReopeningSchools
20200711	1	Good to know! That's where we were headed, but got a call for a test closer to us. Will get results in 24hrs to.... 7 days. It was the highest testing day to-date in IL yesterday. Just want Chicago to be ready for an influx of testing if/when schools reopen. #ReopeningSchools

20200711	1	I don’t know what #teacher needs to hear this but if you are being forced to go back to school next year? Don’t. You should quit. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	I think no. We don’t have a good plan for safely doing it. We don’t know enough about how kids could transmit the virus. We have zero national leadership and huge outbreak spikes right now. It’s crazy to do this. #CloseSchools #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	I want every member of Trump's Administration to escort one child (K-8) to school in Aug or Sept and stay with that child, in the classroom, for the first two weeks of the school opening, and then they could return to the White House.  #LarryKudlow #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	I would LOVE to employ a teacher to come into my home and teach my child while I work from my home office. I already have 2 lined up for my daughter in the fall. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	I'm not looking forward to teaching in the fall.. It's going to be a very stressful, anxious learning environment for students and teachers.  Our district is requiring teachers to take students temp 3 times a day! . #BackToSchool #facetoface #TrumpKillsUs #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	If @realDonaldTrump or @BetsyDeVosED wouldn’t send their kids to crowded public schools during this pandemic....then there is NO reason they are demanding sending kids back to school without a SOLID safety plan!! #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #WorstPresidentInHistory #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	If school doesn't return to a full face to face teaching experience, our families in the district will fight to lower taxes. Why should we be taxed to pay you people to stay home? You people may not agree with @POTUS but most of us on both sides of the aisle do. #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	If the "experts" say kids are at extremely low risk, and "masks work" for the teachers and other staff, what's the problem? More harm is being done to these kids in terms of falling behind and not getting the social interactions they need than by #COVID19. #OpenSchools
20200711	1	I’d like the members of the @nytimes editorial board to identify which schools their children are returning to in late August. @nytopinion #ReopeningSchools

20200711	1	So @AsaHutchinson we are way behind the testing goals send by the CDC and yet YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO DEMAND SCHOOLS REOPEN? DO YOU LIKE THE SMELL OF ALL THE BLOOD THAT'S GOING TO BE ON YOUR HANDS. YOU'RE A TWAT. #COVID19 #coronavirus #wtf #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	So do adults... But NOT at this rate! Flu has a zero point one percent... (0.1%) death rate... Covid is holding at about five percent (5.0%) death rate... FIFTY TIMES more deadly than flu. Try again. #KidsLivesMatter #Covid19 #ReopeningSchools
20200711	1	So prison is a "serious medical risk", but it's ok to send students into closed buildings, with outdated ventilation? At least in prison you're in a cell with a few roommates, not in a room with 25 to 30 students. #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	Thank you @AliefISD .  Take note @GSmithccisd  @ClearCreekISD .  It takes courage to lead...it takes courage to follow too.  Will you let our neighbors stand alone against this madness? Protect our children, keep integrity #NationalTeacherStrike #RefuseToReturn #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	The concerns about kids returning to school isn't just about the health of our children. It's also about the health of the people our children come in contact with.  #COVIDー19 #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	There’s no safe way to open crowded schools- which is nothing like Home Depot, unless you tote 30 kids along.   ICU beds are filling fast, unlike other admits, they stay for 7-14 day average.  Opening schools in a month will be worse than opening too soon.  #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	Think about when you're caring for your child when they're sick. It's awful. You'd do anything to make your little one feel better. Now with that in mind, how does it make you feel that the #POTUS is demanding that you deliberately put your child in harm's way? #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	This is insane to me. How are #Covid cases reaching all time highs & some states like nebraska returning to school (full time in person instruction) starting aug 11th?  It’s like we’re living in the twilight zone. We need to be advocates for our kids & teachers. #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	This nonsense of “should” quarantine, wearing masks “recommended,” “try to“ social distance,”is getting people killed. Politicians afraid to take a strong stand based on science r potentially letting people get away w murder. #COVIDIDIOTS #WearAMask or #StayHome #SchoolReopening

20200711	1	Way too many positive #COVID__19 cases here in #tampa to even remotely think about opening schools. @RonDeSantisFL how could you even think this is a good idea? How many children and teachers will die from this decision? #TampaBayFL #SchoolReopening

20200711	1	We want our kids & teachers to be safe. Guidelines put in place by the @cdc are helping with that. You care about sucking up, #PardonRogerStone #goyafoods and basically everything else other than the safety of our citizens! Please #DoYourJob #Schools #Teachers #ReopeningSchools

20200711	1	When was the last time you went to Home Depot,Walmart or Target 5 days in a row for 6-7 hours at a time? Hard to equate a one time shopping trip to a school week experience.#safteyfirst #SchoolReopening
20200711	1	You can do something. Email your school board members to tell them not to restart school until we have widespread, rapid testing. School boards are elected by YOU, they represent you. Protect your children.#schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening

20200712	1	Americans are losing jobs, insurance, and about 25 million more will be homeless after foreclosures.  But, when schools are forced to reopen, dragging around a corpse-wagon shouting "bring out yer dead" is, traditionally, a steady income. #TrumpVirus #ReopeningSchools

20200712	1	Asked someone when they thought schools should reopen because they argued how unsafe it is for teachers. Response was "when it's safe" What exactly is the definition of "safe" #ReopeningSchools
20200712	1	Employers need to start to be a part of the conversation about reopening schools. How can they support their employees with children if schools go virtual? What can they do to make this work? This needs to be a community effort. #ReopeningSchools
20200712	1	I don’t have kids but if I did I would not be enrolling them in school this fall.  #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200712	1	I don’t have kids but this back & forth on if kids should return to classrooms gives me anxiety. I understand the health concerns but what about those parents that can’t stay home to play teacher? Last I checked bills and living expenses weren’t put on hold. #SchoolReopening
20200712	1	If my children become sick from Covid19 as result of going back to school, I will be their to care for them — but that will expose me to Covid19.  Who will then care for me?  #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #SchoolReopening

20200712	1	We stayed at home for 5 months, BUT we are supposed to send kids back to school in a few weeks as the pandemic worsens??  The wealthy and the politicians work remotely. The president and his staff are tested frequently, but no tests for kids or teachers.   WTF   #SchoolReopening

20200712	1	Yes please. We can’t let DeVos and Trump decide what to do about schools. News is reporting 80% of patents want their kids to go back to in person school. Why? The schools aren’t ready for this. It will just mske everyone at risk. #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200712	1	how on EARTH do you bus children to school with social distancing?those things are like sardine cans. Plus some of our most untouched by covid19 areas are rural, wouldn’t sending them all back together opening a can of death to those net yet exposed? #SchoolReopening

20200713	1	Although things have improved a lot, we are not even close to out of the water yet. Now y'all (looking at you Devos) want to FULLY OPEN SCHOOLS! Y'all don't give a damn about our students,our schools,or us. Just say it! Y'all must be out of your damn minds!#SchoolReopening
20200713	1	And exactly why #Trump chose #BetsyDeVos, a fierce anti-equality in education! Believes you only deserve the education they or their family's can pay. Lower class better get work serving the educated affluent class. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	And the schedule does NOT take into account our health. Not one bit. #SchoolReopening

20200713	1	Are there ANY parents out there at all who feel safe sending their kids back to school face-to-face before there’s a vaccine or palateable treatment?  I see a lot of “go go go let’s do this” tweets from officials but all “hell no” tweets from parents.  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	As a 35 year elementary teacher...good luck trying to keep kids 6 feet apart all day in classrooms that are in buildings constructed in the 1950’s!!! #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	As a parent of kids in middle and high school,  I want them to have social interaction with their friends.  I also want them to be safe, their teachers safe, and the others in my home safe. Do I think normal school in the fall...nope, but maybe a hybrid #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Back in the spring people were so angry and disgusted at the notion of us sending the elderly to spur the economy and now some seem to completely accept school employees doing the same #Covid_19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Before you get caught up on tech tools focus on these areas first to see what they can look like online, F2F, and a mixture of both 1) collaboration 2) feedback 3) assessment 4) class culture 5) creation #edchat #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Being a teacher in Florida, I suggest we postpone the opening of the school year until after Labir Day. Give the districts time to get their plans together AND let the virus calm down! Win-Win! #coronavirus #govdesantis #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	Betsy DeVos is a #%}ing moron! #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Betsy DeVos said that distance learning "would fail America's students, and it would fail taxpayers who pay high taxes for their education,"  My god, how long has it been since this woman has been in a school? Ooh, maybe that's why Trump chose her.  #BetsyDeVos #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Betsy Devos is a perfect example of why you shouldn’t let money dictate who gets the job #PayForPlay #BetsyDeVos #Cult45 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Betsy Devos is trash. I’m so over rich whypipo who live in bubbles saying what others need to do! The school system is trash anyway! Teachers underpaid! More black areas get trash schools! Kids need to rush back WHY ? #BetsyDeVos #teachers #SecretaryofEducation #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	But it's safe to go back to school in person, per DeVos  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	California has it all backwards -- We're releasing prisoners but reopening schools? um. 1+1 does not equal 3. Use common sense, holistic data and science to make  decisions. So stupid.  #covid19 #californiacaved #Gavingaveup #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Can any teachers share what kind of masks they will be using for the 2020 school year? I'm concerned with how a mask may limit essential non-verbal communication with learners (smiling, signing, gesturing, even support for learners with Autism, etc). #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Can’t help but think that if schools have kids rotate between in person and online learning, that’s twice the amount of work for teachers. That we won’t be compensated for either with pay or prep time. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Children safety should come 1st! #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	D O N ' T  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Damned if you Do, Damned if you Don't!  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	DeVos on CNN is such a total fucking moron #DeVos #COVIDIOTS #CoronavirusPandemic #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	DeVos says we can deal with a flare up when it happens, rather than plan for schools to be closed, + there's little danger to kids.  1. Plan ahead, don't react 2. The "flares" so far have been wildfires 3. What about kids spreading to families, teachers + staff?  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Dear Goverment, you want us to open up schools this fall then do this: protect us. Help us. Give us a hand and stand by our side if something happens. If you can do it for @TysonBrand then HELP US.  - @realDonaldTrump @NIH @BetsyDeVosED #ReturnToLearn #covid #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Do people really think New York City public school kids are going to 100% comply with CDC guidelines? Get out of here. Of course I’d love to go back to my school but it’s simply not safe point blank #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Do you offer guidelines or merely suggestions? Asking for @BetsyDeVosED and millions of teachers and schoolchildren. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Does @BetsyDeVosED have any creds other than being rich and part of Trump’s corrupt circle? #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Donald Trump pushes for all schools to reopen this fall. Are people prepared to hold him accountable for any rise of infections and deaths linked with obviously premature reopenings in certain areas? #ReopeningSchoolsSafely #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Either way even if they actually do open it . It’s going to be close in less then 2 weeks . My school can’t even control fights they Think they can control Covid and new rules #SchoolReopening

20200713	1	Everyone is asking the experts if they would send their kids back to school. A better question is, if their loved one was a teacher, custodian, staff member, would they still be willing to open schools under the current conditions?#StaySafe #OpenSchools
20200713	1	Everyone is worried for the students but don’t forget about teachers too! Most teachers are of an older age which leaves them more vulnerable to COVID-19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Falling behind WHOM???!!! Everybody’s in the same boat! But all you see is your profits going down, isn’t it? Children are not commodities. #GreedEqualsDeath #GreedyGOP #PeopleBeforeProfit #CorruptGOP #TrumpIsLosing #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Has Trump worked with Congress to give more funds to schools to help them open safely? Or is Trump doing nothing to help schools? #education #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Having thoughtful, ethical discussions with your children (instead of ramming ideas down their throat) is critical.  #oracy #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	How about a microgrid study with schools?  Are there any studies you’re aware of focused on solar+ microgrid feasibility at education facilities and surrounding communities? #solar #microgrid #research #schools
20200713	1	How about allowing form 4 and standard 8 teachers and students back to boarding schools and taking exams mid next year for instance? Test them and monitor them? Can't we innovate think outside the box? #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	How can the environment where people are be improved? Not just cleaning, but also: greater air circulation (fans?), maintaining hvac systems/filtering, having windows open (problematic in some areas seasonally, but certainly, possible temporary improvement)...? #Covid_19 #schools
20200713	1	How do you suppose #socialdistancing is going to work when all these grade school children practice their active-shooter drills in their classrooms? #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	Hypothetical: what is a school's appropriate response to a HS sophomore who refuses to wear a mask?  #Covid_19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I am preparing for going back on July 29th, and I am putting a lot of trust in other people to protect me, my colleagues, and my students. Thankfully, these people are worthy of my trust. Other schools are not so lucky. #backtoschool #covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I feel for ALL parents who were thrusted into home schooling.  But the US looks like a shit storm!  I would hate for Covid to mutate further and start killing more children than it already because people want children back in school. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I hope that @realDonaldTrump and @BetsyDeVosED aren't pushing to reopen schools so that parents can get back to work and prop up the economy. If children get #COVID they will infect their parents. Now parents STILL can't work and you've endangered everyone. #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	I saw my son's high school principal walk down the supermarket aisle in the wrong direction. His daughter corrected him & he was annoyed. This is the man I am trusting to follow CDC guidelines to head back to school? #FloridaCovidEpicenter #Floridacoronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I think I’m taking a gap year from parenting. #parenting #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I understand gore people did not adhere to the rules and regulations tja Jwala but I'm just worried gore what is going to happen ka mebereko ya rena? . #ImmediateEffect #cyrilramaphosa #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I vacillate between aching to see my students face to face in the fall and panicking that I will have to buy all the masks, anti-viral wipes and hand sanitizer for my students myself because we all know I will. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I wonder how many dead children it will take for someone to decided DeVos has passed her expiration date. Clearly, it past time for the people to start emptying the cabinet. #COVIDIOTS #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I'm worried we'll have a generation of orphans if schools open in person. Anyone else? #BetsyDeVos #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Idk what college freshman needs to hear this but you shouldn't be psyched about school reopening... trust me #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	If you’re completely against schools opening but don’t have a plan for how working families are going to take care of their children and still pay the bills then your privilege is showing. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Is this your dashboard?  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	It may be safe for students to return to school, but what their teachers?  Children can be walking petri dishes. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	It's unprecedented that senior public officers would use state funds to threaten public social service institutions & personnel in such a cynically narcissistic manner, just to massage their outsized egos & rogue agenda.  @SenSchumer #DeVos-#Virus #Responsible #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I’m a 56 year old teacher with underlying conditions.I don’t believe I would survive COVID 19. My district’s school board and superintendent recently met on Zoom to discuss reopening schools for in person classes. I’m scared. I think we should wait for a vaccine #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I’m a high school history teacher. My back-to-school shopping this year includes hiring a lawyer to write my wife and I’s will. #OpenSchoolsLAST #OpenSchools #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	I’m worried teachers aren’t doing enough gun training during the pandemic to be ready for the school year. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Let’s send the kids and teachers back while Federal employees telework......what a crock of Shit!! #teachers #Schools #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	My sister and I, like so many others, including teachers, security,and other staff members literally go from one school to the next on a daily basis in order to help many children.#SchoolReopening
20200713	1	My sister is a teacher and she’s not sending her kids back to school this fall! Why are people rushing children back into a dangerous situation esp  with the flu and COVID-19 possibly in September  #COVIDIOTS #BetsyDeVosIsAwful #TrumpIsA_DANGER_ToAmerica #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	NOW my white anti-mask/anti-BLM/anti-immigrant MAGA neighbors are upset w/our government. Why? Because they are teachers & Trump’s decisions affect them personally. No empathy or understanding for all who have BEEN suffering. As a teacher, I am ashamed of them. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	NY Times editorial on reopening schools only solidifies my decision to cancel my subscription earlier this year. Teachers a complete afterthought in the equation. #NYTimes #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	No one should be surprised they want us to risk our kids by sending them back to school . I mean, they didn’t do anything after all the school shootings . Except this time I can keep them home . #BetsyDeVosED #TrumpVirus #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	No. A #teacher is NOT a #FrontLineHero. That's not in the job description. #Teachers should not risk their lives to do their jobs.  #TeachersStrike #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	No. No best practices provided and no transparency with who is on the committees outside of District leadership. Nor should Pediatricians being getting a voice in schools opening because they have a monetary interest in kids getting sick. #STOPSchoolReopening #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Not the right time. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Of course Trump and DeVos want the schools to reopen. The education system in the US is a money making corporation for the 1%, just like our prison system. And just like it’s prisoners, they don’t give a fuck about the kids or teachers or school workers. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Of course all of this came to a stand still in March due to Covid, but imagine if these schools had stayed open just one more day! There's no saying how disastrous this could have been. Especially being in the epicenter of all of this! #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	People who are advocating for school reopening in the fall 2020 have only one statement and that is:   “School should reopen and kids need to go back to school.”   How and why? Same answer.  CDC guidelines? Same answer.  Do you think its safe? Same answer.   #Covid_19 #schools
20200713	1	Please be careful what you wish for....the economy should not rely on schools opening before they are ready.  Should it be at the cost of your child’s life? #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Please take away #college scholarships, athletic scholarships and student loans, grants, etc. No more tax dollars @BetsyDeVosED @usedgov @JennaEllisEsq #schools
20200713	1	School boards saying no school in Fall 2020 has shown us these schools are not needed. Close and sell the school buildings. LOWER school taxes, furlough teachers and administrators permanently. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	School nurses are front line health care workers!   #EssentialWorkers #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	Schools can’t even control lice but you’re gonna expect them to control COVID?! GTFOH!  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Schools do not exist in a vacuum. Their local communities and local govts are not absolved from being held accountable for their Ss and Ts safety. If schools are going to open, their community leaders need to step up first. #edchat #education #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	Schools will not reopen under Trumps and DeVos schedule. Prove me wrong  #ReopeningSchools #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	So if all school closed in #march  and the cases of the #coronavirus is still increasing, how can school open for the #2020-2021schoolyear? #TEACHers #EDUcators #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	So prisoners are being released because they aren’t safe but schools need to reopen #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Soon after ICE’s SEVP regulation changes, the F-1 students who comprise 2/3 of my class decided to go 100% online from their home countries out of fear of being kicked out of the US in 10 days. Days later the SOE is pushing all in-person classes. Coincidence? #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Soren Kierkegaard suggests that “boredom is the root of all evil”- a perspective we should consider before cancelling school. #Covid_19 #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Teachers shouldn't have to risk their lives for their livelihood. Students will become the next super spreaders and shouldn't have to be exposed to #Covid_19 daily. Parents shouldn't have to choose between their jobs and the safety of their children. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Tell them ohh. Some people thinks if they graduated  from university it all set. Hahahahaha if you are graduating this year or next year congratulations but please am advising you always think of alternate #backtoschool #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Test teachers in Hawai’i at least 14 days before August 4th opening of campuses. This will give all schools a baseline to start assessing the initial needs for substitutes and such. I will be in close contact with your child. You should want me tested. #ReopeningSchools
20200713	1	Thank you! As we enter our final week let us look back. Your tireless, selfless work has shone for all to see. You are a credit to yourselves and your communties. Thank you! #proud #edutwitter #schools
20200713	1	The REAL Reason Schools Are Reopening Is Because Of How Stupid Society Is!!!   #NowYouKnow #SayItAintSo #sorrynotsorry #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	The Trump administration is trying to have it both ways in terms of schools opening. I personally believe we are damned either way. #COVID #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	The goal is wrong, it is not opening schools, the goal is how to effectively educate our children.  We  need to correctly frame the problem to arrive at a solution. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	The key phrase is "safely back to school" NOT just go back to school come hell or high water. GOP. doesn't seem to understand the word "safely".  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	The people afraid children returning to school in the Fall would be a deadly disaster are the same people that were afraid North Korea was going to nuke America after Trump called Kim Jong-Un “Rocket Man”.  Just nod your head & smile as they talk. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	The taxi industry has power #100% .  Would have hoped that you wouldn't endanger our kids lives in the process.  #cyrilramaphosa #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Then keep your children ignorant! The more ignorant you are and the more scared you are the more “they” control you! My kids will be educated! #4MoreYears #POTUS45 #schools
20200713	1	There is absolutely No such thing as "Safe Reopening of Schools". It would be more risk or less risk, however Risk would be there. Every community should assess there risk. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	There is no point of opening schools if we still use common core. Open schools safer and better than ever!! #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	They shouldn't open the school.. keep it online and donate some laptops and some wifi. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	This President, the "cupcake" didn't close schools??? What did Angie say to him entlek?   Bagetsho, learners and teachers are been led in hell's den!  1million graves now make sense... #cyrilramaphosa #SafeSchools #SchoolStayaway #schools
20200713	1	Trump is demanding schools reopen & threatening to withhold funding over it.   Betsy DeVos just admitted it’s not safe to reopen schools, but said we should do it anyways.   This is absolute insanity. Does ANYONE have a plan based on science and not wants?  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Under the new Ofsted Framework whwt is your understanding of ‘local context’? I am hearing different things from different people.   #edutwitter #education #schools
20200713	1	Watched @BetsyDeVosED interviews today. Campus-based learning MUST happen for students/parents who need it. Options MUST be available for students/parents who prefer virtual. Learning needs to happen either way. I don't see anything wrong with that. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	While you're listening, make sure to pay special attention to the families who don't have the luxury of staying home or access to internet. Those are the most at risk. How do we protect our most vulnerable? #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Who would've thought electing an incompetent and corrupt president who then nominates an incompetent and corrupt Secretary of Education would lead to a massive and very dangerous clusterfuck?  #CoronaVirus #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Whoever wound up the #BetsyDeVos doll this morning mixed up her talk tracks so she says the same thing over and over again, even if it doesn't relate to the question. Needs a new battery maybe? or is this a complete short-circuit?  #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Ya know, people always say that “the children are our future”. Then bitch, why are you sending your future into the most dangerous place to be during a global pandemic?? choices. #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	Yes,Betsy in a classroom! #SchoolReopening
20200713	1	You need to be dealt wit....Bye Karen Devos.  #CoronavirusUSA #SchoolReopening

20200713	1	you want us to go back to school? no thanks   #SchoolReopening
20200713	2	I would like to hear from other parents about schools reopening. Amie is 16, she has flat out told me she won't go back until a vaccine exists. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	2	It’s not ideal, but it solves part of the issue. Teachers would be in their own classrooms, there’s really not an issue of cross contamination like there would be with the hybrid or full return model. Maybe something to think about? #onted #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200713	2	Just another day where Betsy DeVos is a fucking evil insane piece of trash. #CloseTheSchools
20200713	2	Most vulnerable populations is code word for populations that need to be policed the most.  #BetsyDeVos #SchoolReopening
20200713	2	Parents need to prepare for the possibility that schools will call the police and/or CPS in the event that they don’t bring their kids to school. Idk if they’ll keep it up, what with the pandemic, but they def did it in SETX (pre-covid) #SchoolReopening
20200713	2	Yet 24/7 we can count on @JoeNBC to deliver #DoomAndGloom from a Democrat Activist view. There are more deaths WW from flu than Covid. #OpenAmerica and #OpenSchools

20200714	1	@BetsyDeVosED your math doesn't add up. If you feel parents should use vouchers for schools (for profit) that will open during an uptick in Covid19; won't that lead to overcrowding of the for profit schools. Is that safer in your mind. #SchoolReopening

20200714	1	@chrislhayes what the heck! Didn’t anyone hear @BetsyDeVosED SAY schools can Do what Front Line workers Do?!?! So my son is supposed to wear PPE to go to school?!? @realDonaldTrump has no clue what to do Or does he Care! #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	A 5% infection rate over 14 days is the safe threshold for reopening some schools.   Meaning, out of a group of 20 non-sick people, one will test positive for COVID within 2 weeks.   How is that good enough to start up classes of 30+ kids in small classrooms? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	And @vademocrats @GovernorVA #DemocratActivist are actively trying to hurt kids by preventing them from going back to school in-person to get an education even after they all cried for and got a virtual school option for their kids. #equity #useless #schoolchoice #SchoolReopening

20200714	1	Dear #BetseyDeVos...  (Don’t know the original author of these words, but kudos to her/him!)  Betsy DeVos we have a few questions for you:  • If a teacher tests positive for COVID-19 are they required to quarantine for 2-3 weeks?... THREAD [1/12] #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Do You Know That By Simply Switching The Way You Buy Airtime, Data, Cable Subscription, Electricity Bill And Sharing The Good News With All Your Friends Can Fetch You good money daily, weekly, monthly and yearly? Don't Argue.Just Say Hi 08038104686 #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Each school district must determine for themselves what measures they must take to reopen their schools. It’s not a one strategy fits all. Student population, location, social econ are all variables. @BetsyDeVosED is clueless @CDCgov #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Gov. #Cuomo was the first US leader to confront #COVIDー19. Singlehandedly, I might add. Deeply sorry for the loss of your loved one. Now we know better so #Republicans #Trump #DeSantis #Florida #Texas #Arizona & Cie. have no excuse to push ahead & kill children #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Had a dream about the first day of school last night. Half of my students came without masks. When I sent them to the nurse to get one...they were told there weren’t any. Then a student coughed on me. #WearAMask #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	He's too busy putting a bounty on our school kids.  Offering to pay school districts that open up so our kids & teachers get sick and die.  #RussianBounty #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I am sending my son back to school in month but I’m too nervous to go to my ymca. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I completely agree with you. This is like a culling. Sorting us out by weakness and ignorance. You have to fight for your children. No one else will fight as hard as we do. They rely on our protection from  covid or anything else that could harm them. #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	I don’t think schools should open... a common school cold makes students stay abesent for days... so with Covid out here no thanks #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I feel more afraid to teach kids music in 5 weeks than I ever did in the 9 years I served in the military.  #FACTS #COVID #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I get that @realDonaldTrump needs to learn to read, but reopening schools during a pandemic isn't the answer #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I teach at a low-income school where most of my students cannot stay home for online and are out in the community working after school hours. I cannot emphasize enough that our at-risk community will be devastated if we go back in a month with cases rising.   #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I think we’re all anticipating a confusing, weird school semester here in the next month. #coronavirus #Covid_19 #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I used to think "surviving" this president's term of office was just a figure of speech... not anymore. #Teachers #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I want my worries and concerns to be wrong.  I want this school year to be normal, or as normal as can be.  I want for there to be no hiccups when my kids go back to school, but I feel we're underestimating our current circumstances. #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I wonder...if #teachers visit/travel/live in highly infected zip codes/areas for personal reasons, what are the rules on quarantine? I wonder if #teachers now have quarantine days available along with state and local days? #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	I would die for my students. In a fire. In a school shooting. In a natural disaster. Not for a pandemic. Not for greed. Not for Him or his Secretary of “Education”. #onlywhenitssafe #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I'm done with TEA  They're hanging up on teachers who call with concerns AND They will not mandate masks for students under the age of 10. At this rate, there aren't going to be any teachers left in Texas bc we'll all quit, be on a vent, or be dead. @teainfo #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	I'm not saying they shouldn't open anywhere. I'm denouncing the Trump/DeVos assertion that "every child should be in school every day everywhere" in August. What happened to the Amend. 10? Why is this politicized?   Isn't it worth the life of a child to wait? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Idk if this Is much but if daycares are open during this whole time during covid, opened from at least 8am-4pm 5 days a week, and the government hasnt changed or done anything for daycare centers. I think public schools can do it too. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	If "masks work", children account for only 2% of COVID cases, and the American Academy of Pediatrics says it's more detrimental to keep kids home than to have them in school, what's the problem? Why do you hate working/single parents, and their children? #OpenSchools
20200714	1	If the governor of my state were putting as much energy into stopping the spread of covid-19 as the school districts are putting into keeping my child out of school I might not be so opposed. Since when are the employees at Walmart more essential than teachers? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	If the virus is airborne, each and every school building's HVAC system and other structural measures MUST be redesigned to significantly reduce airborne infection control along with all the other precautions. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	If your school is discussing  the reopening of in person schooling  via conference call due to Covid concerns maybe it’s not time to open ? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	In 2012 the @GOP decided that the shooting of Kindergartners in school was fine. What in the world makes anyone think they're not absolutely on board with having kids in school now with an uncontrolled pandemic happening? #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Is the mask rule coming in on 24th July because that’s after schools break up? God forbid school staff should want to wear one... #facemask #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	It's becoming increasingly clear to me why the professors and doctors formed that Amish-style community cut off from the real world in "The Village." . . #COVID19 #school #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	It’s bad enough for the kids, but can you imagine any #teacher wearing a #mask for hours while trying to give instructions in a classroom? This will not work! #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	Just a thought. Don't  send your kid to school. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Keeping an eye on this schools are going to be crammed with kids + adults in September how safe that is I do not know #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Los Angeles school district will not have students returning to campus when school reopens... Don't Tell Betsy. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Lots of people, who aren’t working in schools, that I’ve spoken to are unaware that the guidance is not to wear #facemasks. They are pretty shocked when I tell them it’s just ‘open the window’ and ‘wash your hands’. The media hasn’t picked up on it at all. #education #schools
20200714	1	Mbu churches shall open but Sunday schools closed @ #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	My grandchildren will be home schooled this year. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	My kid refused to go to school today and I was also not gonna take her even if she wanted to  Schools must be closed   #MoneyHeist #mbali  ##SchoolMustClose #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200714	1	No one asked #Trump what Biden/Obama testing he was talking about. Reporters/Journalists, please...ask probing questions. Don't give #Trump a pass. He can't just throw crap out there. Some idiots will believe him #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	No one has ever come up with a real plan for what happens when a student, teacher or staff member tests positive or dies from COVID-19. Do you close the school? Do you send the kids in knowing one of them may have contracted it?   #CloseTheSchools
20200714	1	No student above grade 8 should be going back to school this fall. Virtual learning, free internet and computers for anyone that needs it until a vaccine is available. This is 2020 we can do this. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Open schools could KILL our kids, no matter their income level.   Tax the billionaires and re-assign military funds to pay families to stay home in quarantine.  Trust us, you don’t want this virus to grow in strength.   #PeoplesStimulus #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	Open schools. Watch teachers die. Watch what THAT does to kids. Watch parents die. Watch what THAT does to kids. Watch KIDS DIE... the trauma of these deaths can be AVOIDED and is much less damaging than just asking us all to stay home! #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	Public school teachers and their unions are in for a rude surprise if they think the public will be fine with (1)forced at home learning with (2)teachers still being paid full salaries + benefits. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	School officials are in the impossible position of trying to negotiate  reopening schools in ways that keep kids and teachers safe with people who are determined not to allow anything that might look like admitting there's anything out there to be kept safe FROM. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	So Trump wants to end the lockdown and send kids to #school so they can go into lockdown.   Virus, bullets, either way we have failed these children. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	So the Boomers were right we are and raising a generation full of pussies!!...  #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	So what? So what? Yeah, sure, what's a year in a child's life?   What will happen to the schools and teachers - the entire communities, for that matter?  And oh yeah, not one person under 30 has dies because of #COVID19 #mepolitics #OpenSchools
20200714	1	Students can be fully indoctrinated and ready for menial labor by, like, 15. Why do we need colleges?  #Privilege #RichLivesMatter #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Teachers are feeling the anxiety that health care workers felt in March.  Prepare now.  #covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Teachers’ voices must be heard. What’s the most important consideration for reopening school? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	The question isn’t if schools will reopen because they will. The question is will the physical buildings be open? We are wasting time! Work on closing the digital divide. Have workshops for teachers on improving remote learning. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	There is no absolute here.  Kids need schooling which is education, not "need to go back to school" which is a place.  The cost of life outweighs the cost of being at a place every time. Stop word-smithing your way around an issue that could kill thousands.  #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	There is no way I'm sending my kids back to school. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	This coming #school year tell your children, "Treat every day with your teachers as precious because any day could be the last time you see them." #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	This school year is going to feel anything but “traditional” to me. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Thought: Companies like Clorox & Lysol have been saying for months that they are struggling to keep up w/demand. I’ve heard of school supply companies not being able to fill orders well into the fall. If buildings are opened, how will we get them clean? #edchat #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Today, a teacher friend of mine was talking about her back to school prep in light of #COVID19. On her to do list?  Updating her will.  Suppose I should consider that too... #BackToSchool2020 #ProtectOurTeachers #ProtectOurStudents #SchoolPT #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	We need to listen to teachers when reopening schools.  How can we socially distance 30 kids in one room? @UtahSchoolBoard  We need the virus under control, create realistic guidelines, then send our children back to the classroom. #utpol #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	We still need to engage on the matter of schools We support teachers on this one   #mbali #TsongaDrive  ##SchoolMustClose #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200714	1	What are the Government doing to encourage students to study at home. Teaching on TV and on social media is not accessible to those that can not afford Television, satellite, mobile phones, radio and electricity. #NigeriaNews #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	What do you think about school's reopening this fall? Should they? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	What would happen if *they* started a virus war in schools and nobody came? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Why does the GOP so desperately want our kids to return to school this fall? I thought they would prefer the potential tax savings to pay for their tax cuts... what’s their angle? Do they own the lunch room food service companies? In bed with the pencil lobby? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Why would business and non profit leaders have insight into reopening schools?   Do they have skin in the game beyond forcing parents to return to work?  Where are the teachers? Education workers?  #FireLecce #OnEd #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	Will each teacher have a thermometer to take students temp? What if a student comes to school without a mask? What if they refuse? How are teachers expected to teach in person and remote simultaneously? Will additional life insurance be provided to teachers? #ReopeningSchools
20200714	1	Will you be returning to school this year coming year?  #poll #polls #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Woke up with a random thought about wipes. Disinfecting wipes are always on the list of supplies teachers have to buy themselves. Have you tried buying wipes lately? They’re nowhere to be found now when they’re needed more than ever.  #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Wondering right now if there are private middle schools or high schools who are open to offering limited placement to out of state children (whose home states are not following science based reopening precautions) so that they do not have to endanger their lives? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	Y'all bitch's will have to go through every Mexican mom's body if your putting there kids back to school there will be alot of chanclas fly for sure good luck I doubt my mom is going to let me go back to school #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	i wonder if @realDonaldTrump's son Baron is going back to school with a bunch of other kids like everyone else's kids will be doing? #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	if they’re gonna send us to school during all this, they better not complain when people stop showing up bc they’re sick. they better not punish kids for not showing up bc if the cases get higher when school starts idk if i’ll go either. #SchoolReopening
20200714	1	wouldnt it be funny if all the teachers in oklahoma went on strike against reopening schools during covid and we could start an fund to pay them while they're on strike that'd be really funny #ReopeningSchools
20200714	2	@MmusiMaimane if you want something to be done in this country... Get the taxis behind you. #CloseTheSchools
20200714	2	Oh good gracious, just fuck off already #Fauci . You have been punishingly wrong about #COVID19 time and time again. Have some dignity and dummy up about a virus that has a 99% survival. Pandemic my fuzzy ass. #COVID_19 #coronavaccine #ChinaVirus #ReOpenAmerica #OpenSchools
20200714	2	So just got a survey call about opening schools in Idaho.  Some interesting questions to say the least. #CloseTheSchools
20200714	2	The Federal Government has on Monday, 13th July, 2020, released guildlines and requirements for the reopening of schools at all levels though no date of resumption is yet to be announced.  The big question is can students cope?  #CNUI #COVID19 #OpenSchools
20200714	2	Well....this will be a true scientific experiment, with OC kids as the pawns.  #CloseTheSchools
20200715	0	Alcohol was banned with immediate effect because it provides no tenders for creedy comorates, school will proceed due to the fact that they have tenders in schools, ppes, feeding schemes, transportation, etc #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	0	Citizens shouldn’t be subject to infection via contact w/ protesters, unknowingly. For protesting to be more important than church, businesses, and schools remaining open shows our country has a biased view of what is effective against this shit and what isn’t. #OpenSchools

20200715	0	The govmnt is trying to prolong the closure of school so that they are able to “account” for the money that has already been looted.   If schools close now, ba zo funa ichange ye mali e khiphiwe.  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	0	When my kid started preK, we were at the docs once per month. Doc always said, hang in there, it’s better for him. Fast forward 6 years:other than well visits and vaccines, he hasn’t been sick. I’m willing to take my chances as a high risk mom...#OpenSchools
20200715	0	Y’all want schools to shutdown but your kids are all over the streets with no masks  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	#schoolsmustshutdown You just closed/banned alcohol,the reason was/is you are protecting us from Covid 19 because it's extremely increasing everyday yet since schools re-opened teacher's and learner's have added to the  increasingly number #pleaseprotectus #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	2 things that appear on every school supply list across our country: #HandSanitizer & #DisinfectantWipes. Since March these 2 items have been impossible to find due to #COVID19. How the hell are we supposed to send kids to school w/o these 2 crucial essentials?! #SchoolReopening

20200715	1	@BetsyDeVosED telling us to 'figure it out' is actually the opposite of how this dynamic should work.  We're the morons and you're the expert in charge.  We tell YOU to figure it out.   #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	@NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC will have a whole lot of rage dumped on him regardless of what he decides. Plan B makes the most sense Plan C is doable  Plan A is for people who believe in the tooth fairy #COVID19 #facemask #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	@NC_Governor is such a failure for a Governor. Small businesses going out of business, thousands of people wrongfully denied Unemployment, and now they have a meeting on Zoom for "safety" yet are ok with sending kids to school #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	@NC_Governor thank you for your service to our state and for trying to keep us safe. One question why is the NC forcing schools to open so early? Push it back even if schools stay open late in to next summer? Why the rush back now.  #guineapigs #COVID19 #schools
20200715	1	@RepAnnWagner Did you know that the federal government has often coordinated supplies, expertise, and educational efforts in times a national crisis? What are you doing to make sure that happens now? #Covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	@RepAnnWagner What are you doing to help MO get the PPE and contact tracing it needs? What are you doing to make sure my son doesn't die because he went to school in the fall? As one of your constituents, I don't see much happening. #Covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	@RoyBlunt Without any coordinated gov't leadership and with the mountain of nonsensical information coming out of the White House, it is impossible for mothers to feel safe sending their kids to school. What are you doing to help us? #Covid19 #SchoolReopening

20200715	1	According to @realDonaldTrump and @BetsyDeVosED response to send kids to school, shouldn’t they just put sailors back on the ship with the raging fire? I mean just think of all the sailors are going to miss by not being on that ship. #BeBest #COVIDIOT #SchoolReopening

20200715	1	I couldn’t agree more! #DeVosKillsChildren #DeVosMustGo #KeepSchoolsClosed #CloseTheSchools
20200715	1	I don’t think it’s a hoax, but I do feel it’s been politicized and exaggerated now.  I wear a mask and gloves in public cause I choose to. Not because of all the conflicting news stories out there.. #OpenSchools
20200715	1	I doubt that communities know that they have the power to close schools. we shouldn't wait for the government to announce  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	I have no position on whether to #ReopenTheSchools because like most of you, I'm hardly qualified. But I do have a question: Why do we expect greater sacrifice from a #traderjoes clerk than from a teacher? #SchoolsMustShutdown #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I sincerely hope that every school district trying to be in-person this fall is hiring a hoarde of counselors. The first death at the school is going to shake us all. And my school alone is predicted for 17 student deaths and 1 staff. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I suppose we're going to have to put our kids on school buses @BetsyDeVosED  6 ft apart? #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I think it’s safe to say that kids learn more when they’re alive #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I wish we could stop death from happening. We can’t #Life has risks #Data says #Students need to be back at #School If teachers or students do not want go back fine but that will be a small % The #NEA  is just using the #kids  as a bargaining tool in all of this #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I'll keep giving myself haircuts just like I'll homeschool my kid while the pandemic rages in AZ. I expect the same less than ideal results from each, but human life is more important. We will get through this. #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools
20200715	1	I'm YOUTH Brigade we have not been paid at that time we risk our lives to make sure that for those schools open are safe for kids by sanitizing classes and kids before and after school, taking temp, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks #PayBrigades #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	I'm not willing to play "wack a mole" with school opening. We need to protect our Teachers, Administrators, Facility Staff Members and most importantly our children and their families.   #WearADamnMask #COVID19 #nc13 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I've been through an era of teens getting caught having sex in the hallways, cafeteria, and the bathrooms. These mfs are not wearing no damn mask and they aren't gonna stay six feet apart. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	If "just say no" ever applied to something other than drugs, it applies to this.  #justsayno #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	If a school board decides that a zoom meeting is the safest way to meet and decide on schools reopening... they just made a decision on the safety of schools reopening and are now just debating if it is worth it to endanger your children! #COVID19 #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	If schools shut down, teachers should get full salary. They have bills to pay and families to take care of, just like us who receive NSFAS money without going to class/school. Getting SASSA money doing nothing and those getting UIF money because they deserve #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	If you are advocating for schools to fully reopen, but you’ve never advocated for them to be fully funded, please take several seats- these two things are related. @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump SMH #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	If you are an educator, please call an attorney & create your last will and testament now; plus, take the time to set up a living will.   #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	If you have an online option for school and can do it, I encourage you too. Your child is NOT expendable for @realDonaldTrump’s re-election. #SchoolsMustShutdown #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Imagine people saying teachers must not get paid if schools shut down, yet some people get grants just for having babies #Angie #COVID19SouthAfrica #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	It is not your schools responsibility to provide childcare, social services, and food. Do not blame the schools and for ffs do not blame the teachers!!! Why create so much conflict between the community and the school system?!?! Call your Governers!! #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	It must be nice to live in a fairy land. You do realize this virus will be with us EVERY school year, right?  Yes, we need to open schools and expect a bump in infections. The positive is we have a ton more testing and effective cures when caught early. #OpenSchools
20200715	1	It’s a shame it took the WuhanVirus aka COVID-19 to finally reduce class sizes that parents & teachers have been requesting for years  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	It’s good complaints of parents angry their schools won’t reopen is being captured on social media. When their protests work & schools open & their child gets sick, they’ll be the first to protest. The aggressively willful ignorance is BEYOND staggering. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	I’m gonna #FindSomethingNew if they make me teach in person next month. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Jesus Christ. I should not have watched the news. #COVID19 #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	John Hattie asking us if we will take what we have learned and grown from back in to the classroom or go straight back to the old? What did you do online that was better than in your classroom? @PeterMDeWitt @educationweek #reflection #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Just #takeacruise #itsnotthstdangerous #gopfail #gopcovid #schools
20200715	1	Just a thought, what do parents do during the summer months when kids aren't in school? Everyone is saying kids have to get back in school so the parents can get back to work, no one seems to care about the kids not being in school for the summer. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Just because someone is “low risk” for infection doesn’t mean we’re expendable. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Just close the schools and promote each and every learner i mean this education system is all about producing factory faults. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Just close the schools till January 2021 then observe by then os the pandamic ia under control and reopen because this open amd close is not nice, schools must also make covid19 subjects compulsory for all students #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Just listened to my daughters school board meeting. A very blunt rebuke to Trump @WhiteHouse politicizing school reopening. Large consensus of teachers feeling like @usedgov @BetsyDeVosED have failed them & their students with no help. #trump #coronavirus #BetsyDeVos #schools
20200715	1	Kids go to school so they can learn, not so you can work. Not so they can die. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Kids in Ohio schools now have to wear masks and social distance in school. What the hell is the point of school going to school then just do online #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Kids should be in school for education, socialization, essential services and (most importantly) so we can all stop having to pretend to care about @Minecraft BUT EVEN SO...IT’S CLEARLY NOT SAFE YET. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Laws are never 100%, but they do get a good number of people to comply and present a united front on the response. #Covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Listen to your staff and communities. We have a lot to say, but we can't forget to see where the needs are and what people want to see. @UHCOE @CyFairISD @DrGlendaHorner #CoogLeaders #education #edu #teachers #schools
20200715	1	Marketing campuses- current and fresh content. Consistent communication is key: website, social media, even the marquee. Be intentional with communication. @UHCOE @CyFairISD @DrGlendaHorner #CoogLeaders #education #edu #teachers #schools
20200715	1	Mums undertaking a #PhD study during this #covid situation: please any tip or advice to get back on track while kids at home, mothering, caring, entertaining etc. 24/7!!! #phdchat #phdmom #phdmum #PhDTweetDiary #phdlife #Quarantine #school #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	My granddaughter lives with me yr 11 HAS to go to school! @DanielAndrewsMP don't you know so many grandparents are bringing up their homeless grandchildren, some with no government assistance! She's been doing very well with homeschooling. #CloseTheSchools
20200715	1	NC School Reopening Plan can include alternate days. There MUST be: temp screenings, masks & social distancing. @NC_Governor will provide 5 reusable masks for every student & staff. @WFMY #2WTK #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	NOT BEING FORCED IT WILL BE OPTIONAL. Trump did delegate to the CDC and FDA not sure if you are aware that he NEVER claimed to be a virologist or virus expert. That is why he DELEGATED to the experts. If you have an issue bring it up with them @PressSec #coronavirus #schools
20200715	1	No matter the environment learning will continue (in-person or virtually). How to accomplish the other 3/4 of what makes school important, the socialization, the social-emotional learning, the therapies, the special education and the arts and physical education? #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Nollen at Madibogo :I think the government must close the schools for this year : and rebuild the schools, toilet furniture books ,and and and #CloseTheSchools
20200715	1	Now 4 hours in to the school board meeting and 3k people still watching online...obviously a hot topic #ReopeningSchools #schools
20200715	1	Option of homeschooling is for the rich. Not for the poor. You gave Us no choice. Then you say if they don’t go to school there wont be be space for them next year . What choice or options are there? #COVID19 #angie #LockdownSA #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Our @DBE_SA needs serious reform #SADTU teachers even though it can't be done now can we suggest ways to transform it for the future below . This pendamic is not the last one we need to be ready. #WhatsApp #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Our future is in the hands of our children, is not like am saying this because I left school with grade 7 but schools must be closed. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Our school district is having #zoom meetings to discuss returning to school in 6 weeks.   That’s it.  That’s the tweet.  #returntoschool #fall #zoommeetings #MakesSense #ScienceIsReal #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Our teachers aren't covid bouncers. These must happen: 1. Getting real PPEs' used by front line staff in hospitals not just the sanitizers and only two masks. What nonsense is that. 2. DBE should insure that classrooms have correct ventilation   #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	PT.2 So all y'all kids who cut up and goof off and disrupt the class room when people trying to learn Y'ALL BETTER STAY YOUR ASSES HOME AND DO ONLINE SCHOOLING Y'ALL DIDN'T CARE THEN SO DON'T CARE NOW!!!  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Parents have the power, by simply pulling all your kids out of school, all schools will shut down!   #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Parents keeping their children home from school and socially distanced is not causing them to die. It sucks for all of us but it is not the death sentence it could be if we reopen schools (while saying prisons are too dangerous) #TrumpIsUnwell #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Pence doesn't want CDC guidelines to "get in the way" of schools reopening.  No, he really said that  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Personally, I love to sacrifice my children for profit #BetsyDeVos #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Plan C for North Carolina and the nation is the safest option for schools. Yes, a bit of an inconvenience to most parents and @realDonaldTrump but safety should always be first. Kids will give COVID to their families without question. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Please tell the government to shut down schools and pay teachers without bringing up the child support grant as if it's not important yona. I don't understand why people always attack people who earn grant, it's for kids, they are innocent they need it. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Pres. Trump is apparently more worried about imaginary deaths, supposedly caused by kids not being able to go to school, than he is about the many thousands of real deaths being caused by COVID-19. #DonaldTrump #COVID19Pandemic #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Schools should balance the value of a continuous online education against the value of a discontinuous, in person/online education unpredictably disrupted by #COVID19 outbreaks/mortality and predictable/rational parental concern over keeping their kids in school. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Schools should just be closed,the 2020 curriculum will continue once the vaccine is found,even if it means 2020 curriculum get done in 2021-2022,we’ll have to adjust & catch-up at some point.   #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Schools were opened to finance & maintain #CadreEconomy #ComradesInCorruption #AncPrivilege #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Schools won't shut down because the government is if certain the problem is with alcohol and cigarettes #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Shut down schools and continuepaying teachers . You pay people for making children so why not somebody who did not choose to put their life on hold ? #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	So Orange County Board of Education votes to send kids back to school with NO masks or social distancing.  The meeting happened via video conference and a couple board members wearing masks. You will sacrifice your students but not yourselves? @OrangeCoSchools #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	So according to @bcsdschools,  students can remove their "encouraged" but not required masks as soon as they enter the classroom...  Basically, teacher's lives are worthless.  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	So if the federal government takes away school funding, then can we get our money back please! #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	So our district just announced we will be starting the new school year with distance learning! #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Sounds good Jenn I know what a great teacher you are but everyone needs to remind themselves that these conditions are just temporary. I am sure all will be well at the latest 2nd semester. You guys can do it. You must stay safe. @MrsRodgersDHS #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	South Carolina’s education system needs a complete refresh. #SouthCarolina #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Special education students, in particular with autism, got the shaft. They need to be in person. But it's not possible in these conditions. -Elena Brantley-Phillips, Detroit teacher speaking to @AliVelshi #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Step down Mark, Chuck Woolery and @BetsyDeVosED have this. No need for your well thought out ideas. #ChuckWoolery #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Teachers need a massive raise.  #education #schools
20200715	1	Teachers were purchasing Kleenex and hand sanitizer with their own $ pre-COVID. The likelihood of them having to purchase PPE & other items for their students is high, and enforcing the use of them is a whole different story.   #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	That orange chump use to fuck kids now he wants to kill them #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	The @GOP governors are about to feel the wrath of motherhood in 4,3,2.... #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	The colder it becomes the higher the level of Covid-19 cases rise...our children aren’t coping at all. Although the curriculum has to be covered mara not like this,come on now! Most of the learners are in hospitals right now, so what’s the use grand sharp?#SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	The fact that SC is using the term “weaker districts” and not saying what they are going to do to make those districts stronger but advocating for them to get back into school-says that these people are just responding to politics. #SC #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	The group chats are lit. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	The only leaners who will be affected are kids from disadvantaged schools.  Otherwise in private schools it's still business as usual through online and home schooling.#SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	The president has the sister of a murderer as his Secretary of Education.  They don't care.  #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Them saying “kids do not spread the coronavirus to adults” and “schools are not huge spreading zoned” these schools are small af . They areFilled with germs. It’s the same as if one kid has the flu then everyone is just passing it around . Kids CAN infect adults #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	There are so many cases coming from schools and lots of other people are getting infected do they want us to die school must shutdown now school must shutdown or we are all going to die #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	There’s a big difference between kids on the street to kids being in school. Plus U didn’t even try to do anything about kids being SHOT & KILLED in SCHOOL! What happened after U met w/ the Parkland students? NOTHING! #ParklandStudents #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	These kids only went to school for 2 months this year l mean schools were opened on the 15/01/2020 to the 14/03/2020 . They might as well stay at home the whole year and start afresh next year same Grade.  What's so difficult about that. Mxxxxxxm pissed #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	They are Actually CONVINCING Parents to Send Their Children to school in DEATH #nced #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	They don't want online classes because that breaks the "caste system" the public school system is designed to reinforce  They can't afford for us to see what our kids can do if the rich kids aren't picking on them Or when it stops mattering your district is broke #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	They say schools will not open till it’s safe!!! When will that even be?? Next month, Next year?? How about NEVER!! This Covid has no end in sight. We will be forced to wear masks indefinitely. This IS the new normal. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	This has been going on for years now. No change whatsoever in the past 8 years. #Cambodia #rural #education #students #dropouts #schools
20200715	1	This is tiring, those parents who says kids are safe at schools should just bring them once, and hope their funeral covers and policies are up to date...mine will be at home!!! #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Those who still don't believe in the magic of doing something on the very first day of the year..   2020 k first day pe hi vacations extend hue thee.   #unbanpubginpakistan LUMS #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Thoughts-Gun Activists want the right to shoot up schools and want kids in school dying from disease. Why do gun activists hate children so much? How do student practice social distancing when there is an active shooter on the grounds? Thoughts.#SchoolReopening
20200715	1	True. Same argument some of us where making about gun control when @GovAbbott @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn all tried to arm #teachers as a solution to defend their life. Now they're asking the same again. #COVID19 #schools
20200715	1	Trump says schools indoctrinate children. As a liberal, I often disagree w/ @realDonaldTrump but he’s right. And so I think the safest thing for our kids is to be #remote learning in the fall. Screw the scientists, do this to put it to the leftist school system. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Trump/DeVos are using the country's children & teachers like canaries in a mineshaft. #devosthinkstheresanacceptableamountofchildrendeath #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Two points about opening schools.   1. Schools are designed to ensure the very conditions that cause rapid transmission of disease. Overcrowding in contained spaces for extended periods.  2. Lack of funding and time to make proactive modifications to solve #1.  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Urgent: Someone, somewhere needs to counsel parents to have a current ‘Will’ and to update guardians <with back-up guardians> named for their children...  Will the next big Federal housing project be orphanages?  #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Watching my friends tear apart my ignorant ass aunts and uncles on Facebook may be one of my favorite things to have ever happened. Special shoutout to @JayMantis for calling my aunt a deranged bag of mulch. #Covid_19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	We already have a teacher shortage, but sure let's just send them all to their deaths. I'm sooo excited to student teach in the fall  #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	We already have to worry about our kids being the victims of school shootings, thanks to Republicans' fealty to the NRA. Now we have to worry about them catching a deadly disease that is still spreading like wildfire across our country. Opening schools is folly.  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	We don't know the full extent of the epidemic in this country. We lack the basic information and equipment to do anything to protect ourselves. I want it all. I am scared and I am a mother who will demand action. We just can't wait until January. #Covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	We don't! The freaking idiots in charge are the ones trying to make us. Believe me, there are plenty of parents and teachers against the idea of our children being tributes to @realDonaldTrump ,the dear leader of @GovAbbott & @DanPatrick . #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	We need guidance on how to keep teachers & pupils safe. There is nothing. My husband is a KS2 teacher & I am vulnerable. It feels inevitable that when he returns in Sept, I will catch this virus. He feels by doing his job he may be signing my death warrant. #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	We not saying schools should close forever nah,they should at least take a break to recover until the 2nd week of August.The aim is for the harsh winter conditions to pass then things can get back to normal.We will try by all means that our children comply. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	We pulled our kids from public school. “Disciplinary action” for not wearing a mask in their new policy was a little too far. @CaveCreekUSD93 #OpenSchools
20200715	1	Well, that says it all! #StayAtHome #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	What doesn't make sense is our jobs are closed and schools open and we expected to pay school fees and provide lunch food how Uif not even paying #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	What if we were given scientific proof that Covid-19 is waterborne?? #WhatsApp #July31 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	What is worse the spread of #COVID19 or the loss of socialization and communication of our #Children? I fear we might be raising a generation that only communicates and transacts through a screen. #socialisolationism #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	When I read this I can’t help but conclude that opening schools is the worst possible thing we could do. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	When the character of someone is not clear to you, look at their friends. - Unknown  #johhanesburg #schools
20200715	1	Who is Angie Motshega if @WHO has said it is not safe for schools to reopen during the spike of the pandemic. Parents let's not take our kids to schools WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Why are schools still open????? Mr President you and your cabinet are bloody clueless #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Why aren't we organizing to demand federal coordination of our limited supplies? If it is because we don't trust Trump, why aren't we getting rid of him? Can we afford to wait until January? #Covid19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Why is everything political? It is the @GOP who's playing politics.  The @TheDemocrats are protecting the kids and teachers! #COVID19 #SaveTheChildren #SchoolReopening

20200715	1	Why so many zoom meetings across  to make decisions about  #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Wow, so KIPP is trying to “decide” if they will close down the whole school if someone tests positive.   What the hell is there to decide?  #KIPP #Houston #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Wow. Weird non standards. #Covid19usa #SchoolReopening
20200715	1	Yes. Or, their parents. —IF #schools are to open —it MUST be safely & compliantly, w/ Privacy at the helm. I help #Districts who need- do so; such a shame we call Education the “Great Economy Starter” versus the “Great Equalizer?” I am writing on that now. #ReopeningSchools
20200715	1	Young people are dying in schools, please close those doors. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Y’all want schools to shutdown but your kids are all over the streets with no masks  #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200716	0	So true. Your teachers need to focus on what they need to do to get ready for the fall semester. Teachers are planning right now. Let them know what the expectation will be. Online learning is a temporary situation. #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200716	1	America is so used to children being gunned down while AT SCHOOL that it seems very easy for them to ready for #COVID19 deaths that are coming for the teachers/students/their families as American schools are being FORCED to reopen for in person education!#SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	And to think  they pay these people to teach children? No wonder so many young people are clueless! #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	And what exactly are you doing to make schools any safer, Senator?  Teachers and students need PPEs and testing.  Most school don’t have nurses or even money for sanitizers and tissues. You want all kids going back to school without safeguards?  #NotMyChild
20200716	1	Anyone considering keeping their children home this fall, consider @K12Learn ! If available in your state, it's considered "public school", they provide laptops, school supplies, and at no cost. Live classes, and support if needed. #Covid19 #SchoolReopening

20200716	1	Hey @ABQschools do you have a plan yet for reopening? The first day of #school is a month away and parents are in the dark about what your "hybrid plan" looks like. We're beginning to look at online-only schools instead. #ReopeningSchools
20200716	1	How on earth is attempting to dump 120 children into a classroom with no one wearing a mask safeguarding them?!   #schoolshambles #schools
20200716	1	I am sick to my stomach over the thought that there are districts informing #teachers to update their wills and having both children and teachers sign waivers over dying. We are not at a point of safety to open schools properly. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	I haven't heard of any school districts commit to providing its staff with PPE aside from two reusable masks. #SchoolReopening

20200716	1	I’m sure McMaster is pro-life, except when it comes to keeping school aged kids alive. #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	Let me get this straight, COVID-19 is to dangerous for some prisoners so they’re being released but it’s safe enough to send kids back to school??  #TrumpIsNotWell #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	Love that @GavinNewsom isn’t taking a stand on school reopenings because he doesn’t care since he can afford the luxury of homeschooling his own children. So now places like @clovisusd be just become a #superspreader come fall. #ClovisUnified #COVID19 #California #SchoolReopening

20200716	1	SFUSD parents complained about distance learning. Teachers had no training, so of course it sucked. Now they’re like, just do outdoor ed!   Guys: YOU NEED TRAINING FOR THAT TOO (and 3 weeks ain’t gonna do it).  Don’t set us up to fail again.  #COVID19 #school #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	Schools around the country will be reopening soon with the implementation of new cleaning procedures. Unless testing is performed to verify cleaning, they are only #cleaningforshow. Would schools also just presume learning has taken place without any assessment? #SchoolReopening

20200716	1	The ghost of Christmas past continues to confront us with more horrors of our own making, we see that we've become a society made up of parents who can't be bothered with the raising if their own children.  #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	The ideaology that the US wants kids to go to school is insane... I get Universities bc at least a majority of college students will be wise, but kids don’t quite understand the importance of the mask & how dangerous this is for them & their family... #SchoolReopening

20200716	1	What is the % of parents that can’t wait to send their kids back to school? It’s probably really high. FYI the reason has little to do with education. #TakeMyKidsPlease #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	What is your school/district planning on doing for the next school year? Will you be #DistanceLearning, in-person with restrictions, a hybrid of both, or has your school/district not decided yet?  #tlchat #edchat #librarians #teachers #school #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	What will happen when a student says, "I'm not wearing a Damn Mask."  #SchoolReopening

20200716	1	instead of asking if schools should reopen or not maybe ask what they'll be teaching kids? doesn't seem like the stuff they've taught any of the current adults did a lick of good so...  #SchoolReopening
20200716	1	“A major teachers union in Los Angeles says the district can’t re-open schools until there is a ‘moratorium’ on charter schools."   With good reason. Charter schools do not protect teachers, refuse troubled students, drain money and talent from our school system. #SaveOurSchools

20200717	0	I'm thinking that if kids going into college thing that 15% of $8,000 is about $300.00 that we really need school choice and to open up schools now.  #SchoolChoice #OpenSchools

20200717	1	*whispers* The @GOP isn't trying to win @realDonaldTrump votes by sending your kids back to school with no #COVID19 plan, they're trying to destroy public education by bankrupting and breaking the system by sending it into total chaos when half or more don't show up #NotMyChild
20200717	1	. . . Bus to inner-city 4-room aprtmt shared w/ 10 other ppl. Scant supper, no wifi, no computer, no A/C. Homework in crowded, noisy, distracting, busy main room. Go to bed hot, hungry, scared, angry. Repeat daily for 4 weeks. Ask GOP congress for $ for schools. #testing #schools

20200717	1	Alrighty. Now that I got that off my chest, let me go to my 9 o’clock zoom where we will again discuss how to open our schools across two states. Have a great day. #ReopeningSchools
20200717	1	Also she keeps talking about it being safe for children to go back to school but what about teachers? Why is the administration trying to lower cdc guidelines instead of helping schools to find ways to comply with them?  #PressBriefing #covid19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	But now it’s ok to send them to school meanwhile #coronavirus it’s still infecting anyone  There’s no cure No vaccine No treatment   & something like #WearAMaskSaveALife is a fighting issue  Parents Listen to Science Facts Medical Experts  Your children depend on you  #NotMyChild

20200717	1	Dear Trump, DeVos and all #MAGA pushing to reopen schools before it is safe,  If are Federal government had taken this pandemic seriously and acted accordingly it would be safe to reopen schools this fall. But they didn't, so it's not.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Definitely keeping my kids home until there is a tested, wide spread vaccine. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Don’t reopen schools in the fall. Protect your children from a failed government and the deluded sycophants that continue to support it. #NotMyChild

20200717	1	Having a bit of a moment watching the @grove_road virtual assembly. This school has totally knocked it out of the park with their virtual learning, care for kids & engagement with families. Massive kudos to the crew at #TeamGR this morning.  #Harrogate #schools
20200717	1	Hey @RepValDemings what are you doing to help central Florida teachers in @OrangeCoFL to stay safe this school year? @JerryDemings doesn’t seem to want to take responsibility for closing the county and keeping kids and teachers safe.  #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	How about instead of endangering children, you give some money to education and fix our schools' horrible technology infrastructure so they can do the same things from home.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I challenge @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @BetsyDeVosED  to attend schools 5 days a week, 7 hrs a day when schools reopen. Come on in, sit in a desk, use the kids' restrooms, navigate the crowded halls, ride the bus, sit in the cafeteria if it's so safe. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I don't even know how to feel right now. District just announced that we will be going back. The district right across the river has pushed back their start date. So I guess we get to be the test subjects  #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	I don’t even HAVE a child, and I understand that is imperative we keep schools closed until it is safe for students, teachera and staff. This shouldn’t be hard to grasp. #NotMyChild

20200717	1	I pray that SCDHEC stays transparent. I heard today that our incompetent governor is directing SCDHEC to change the way they report their numbers. to not give people enough information, so McMaster can do Trump’s bidding in opening our schools without restrictions.#NotMyChild
20200717	1	I remember our middle school didn't have recess. Classes had to earn/win recess time and non uniform days.  Which didn't happen often.  #schools

20200717	1	If I'm wrong about schools reopening, all that happens is my son does distance learning for another semester or two. If DeVos is wrong, people die. I'll say it again. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	If Malls are not opening because of concerns with recirculated air #Ventilation HVAC systems spreading Coronavirus. Schools with sealed windows, interior classrooms, & the same recirculated air ventilation that fans #Coronavirus around shouldn't open.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Is it just me or did @GeneralMills make their BoxTops for education more difficult? Schools started holding contests for who collected the most. People started cutting them out after ignoring them for so long! The scan receipt is BS. #boxtops #schools
20200717	1	It amazes me how many people believe that virtual teaching means teachers are simply sitting at home doing nothing. #teachers #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	It's not only about children. It's also about what they are going to bring home. It's also about adults, parents, esp. grandparents and so on. Look at Israel. They opened the schools and next thing was an explosion of cases among children AND adults. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I’m homeschooling this year. Not risking my daughter over someone who doesn’t understand wind and thinks the enemy is a friend.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Kayleigh McEnany said "the science shouldn't stand in the way" of schools opening.  During a pandemic the only thing we should listen to is SCIENCE! My children are not political pawns #NotMyChildren #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Keep Schools closed but cut off unemployment, watch how fast  parent fight to open schools!! #FridayMotivation #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	Masks keep people safe and that includes the teachers. If you want your child to wear a mask at school, keep them home. If you can’t do that- well guess what unless they have a medical reason, your kids is wearing a mask. #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	My daughter is a SLP working in public schools. I do not want her to be exposed to COVID everyday and risk our lives for an agenda from the trump regime. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	My school district just announced that we will be 100% online for the first three weeks. I am breathing so much better with this news. My superintendent is putting the lives of students and staff first and I am very grateful.  #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	NYC doing a great job going to open public day care centers instead of schools because like strip clubs the virus can’t spread there. #NYC #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	No parent should have to struggle to get their child tested without multiple calls and trips, waiting days for a telemedicine visit, or paying a $49 copay-and all that is before the long wait for the results.Testing should not be a luxury commodity.#CovidTesting #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	No vaccine, no school!  Kids are required to show vaccine records to set foot on any public school campus. Now we are letting that slide so they can pass around COVID and risk dying?   #NotMyChild
20200717	1	No, its a really simple visual demonstrating that our children and families are at risks. None of the people advocating for schools opening have children who will be impacted by this. Trump, DeVos, Pence... #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Obviously opening schools as usual all across the country is insane and dangerous. However, if you are screaming about closing schools without demanding a solution for parents suddenly without childcare then you do not actually care about parents or children  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Opening schools w/out a clear plan could put people at risk. It’s not just the students we have to worry about but I have friends & family members that are teachers and administrators—they need to be protected too. Front line workers need to be protected #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	POS in Chief promised to protect us. That promise should have included our children, teachers, and everyone who works in our schools. Not just the 1%. But the smart ones knew. And we voted for Hillary. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	People saying that schools and the economy could already be opened, with significantly less danger and financial distress, if we just handled the virus as well as most other countries are missing the point! COVFEFE! @realDonaldTrump #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Pipe down until you get us testing, PPE, and safety measures in the classroom. You want us to go, John? Your kids go first. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Pro lifers:  Life begins at conception We must protect all those babies  Also pro lifers: Send the kids to schools or defund them! We know we’re in the middle of a pandemic and some may not make it, but we have to take the chances. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Questions for #Teachers:  Do you plan to teach online, or go back face-to-face in school? Both?   ALSO... Has your school changed the dress code allowing for scrubs? If so - tweet me pics in your scrubs for my story today!  @wfaa @News8Daybreak   #SchoolChoice #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	Reasons why the government schools in Kerala are on par with private schools 1. School Infrastructure - 200 schools are upgraded every year by government. 2. PPP model schools which are growing rapidly YOY in Kerala.  #kerala #schoolsreopening #schools
20200717	1	Remember when people said, "Imagine if Covid-19 killed children instead of the elderly...how would we react then?"  Do we want to find out?  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Reopening schools this fall as if everything is normal is stupid.  Students, teachers and staff are worth protecting.  Im not willing to send my kids into harms way for trumps ego. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Republicans: "All lives matter!"  *is asked to wear a mask for the sake of others*  Republicans: "No, not like that!"  #notmykid #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Restaurants in a nearby town opened during the last "phase". Now several are closed due to #COVID19 outbreaks. But the local schools and colleges will be open on August 17th. Thanks @NC_Governor Roy Cooper! #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	Riddle me this...the government has been so hell bent on vaccinations not allowing kids to attend school until they’re updated..we don’t even have a fucking vaccine for COVID so why does this moron and his negligent administration want to reopen schools?? #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Saying"science should not stand in the way" is like saying reality shouldn't stand in the way. #WhiteHouse #Corona #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	Schools are being asked to write plans that at best can be called fiction. Schools are designed to put as many ppl in on space as possible. Elementary classes have carpets where kids sit inches apart. In person learning is intimate by design. #ReopeningSchools
20200717	1	Schools never should have been shutdown in the first place. Education is an “essential” business! #OpenSchools
20200717	1	Schools won't be safe until the virus is under control. You are a ghoul. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Science is NOT on the side of reopening brick and mortar schools!! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Science is based on FACTS  Not Figures Not Corporations  Not Political Agendas  And not for negligent, corrupt criminals who want to jumpstart economy to work their campaigns.  Schools should be closed until there is a vaccine.  This is Our Children  Not Products.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Send your kids to public schools first.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Serious question and I’m a Roy Cooper supporter.. How do working parents afford, and or arrange, for a 2 day in person school week? I know many places are doing this but what do parents do on the other days? How do we keep our job?   #NorthCarolina #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	Show us the science that children and staff are not in harm's way if schools open.< All of it, as I know you hate cherry picked data.>   Cases are skyrocketing. Schools are *not* daycares. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So I guess trumpedo administration is abolishing science in schools. Cuz what it’s the point to teach children science if adults (not all of them but the stupid ones) don’t believe in it. Anyway my daughter is NOT going to face to face school this fall. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So glad Dekalb County schools doing virtual cause going back to school during this mess!?! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So hold on, children are expected to go back to school in September with no masks but you have to wear them to the supermarket, the government haven’t filled parliament yet but expect kids to go back to school.  are you sending yours on September. Please share rt #schools
20200717	1	So, Republicans want to move their stupid convention outdoors, but kids should go sit in schools?  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So, how many schools are going to be renamed after this year in memory of a teacher who passes from #COVID19? Asking for a friend. #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	So. What are we MISSING while Donald & betsy promote reopening schools?  Tax returns? Rigged 2016? Rigged 2020? The siphoning off of USA $$$ to Russia & China?   MARY TRUMPS BOOK?   Donalds escape hatch getting readied?    #NotMyChild
20200717	1	THE ONLY ONES RUSHING TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS DON’’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE KIDS OR EDUCATION. IT’S POLITICS  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Taught 30 years. I can tell you that schools are a Petri dish for germs. Kids don’t follow/understand hygiene standards like adults do, and they constantly touch one another. Normally our bodies fight it off. Not with Covid. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Teachers are already underappreciated and paid nothing as it is. Now teachers are expected to fight a deadly disease like #Covid19 ? Teacher lives matter, student lives matter, black student lives matter. All lives matter. Teachers and students are not an experiment #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Thanks  for knowingly withholding the #KAG #Wuhan #ChinaVirus #Kungflu #OpenSchools
20200717	1	That's NH Republican Governor Sununu's plan too. Unreal.  #NHpolitics #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	The Republicans didn’t care about gun violence in our schools, why would they care about a virus! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The challenge with public health is proving negatives. If we don't open schools and cases drop the "we should have opened schools" crowd will squeal. Don't open schools anyway. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	The rough and unexpected rollout of online learning earlier this year was the result of a pandemic no one expected. The rollout of online learning for the upcoming year can be much better. Now's the time to prepare for that, instead of opening doors too soon. #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	The same people that are running around saying they won’t where a mask because it’s government control are now demanding that you send your children to school #Hypocrisy #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The science is not "on our side." They keep saying countries which have reopened schools, but those countries have managed the virus, where have not! We are currently averaging 62K new cases a day. She even says we are the outlier. Yeah because Trump F*cked this up! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The science is there for the governments that have followed the science. This government didn’t. You left the logistics of a pandemic to the states so your administration could have plausible deniability. Schools cannot open safely due to negligence. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	The science should be the only thing that matters to reopen schools #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The way we'll know if @GOP really thinks it will be safe to go back to classrooms will be if they gut OSHA provisions for Workers Compensation if employees contract work related COVID19 illnesses. That would be a strike-worthy issue. #coronavirus #NotMyChild
20200717	1	There's a bunch of Charlie Manson's running around. Don't leave your life in these killers hands. And do not sacrifice your children for these murderers!  #WearAMask #NotMyChild
20200717	1	There's a vas deferens between Urology and Infectious Disease specialities. The science is clear that it's not safe to reopen schools. This is genocide and YOU should be ashamed for promoting the WH talking points and not facts. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	They brag about being the “pro-life” party yet are doing nothing to protect our children in their own schools, whether it be from this pandemic or from school shootings - their hypocrisy knows no bounds....#NotMyChild
20200717	1	Today our school released their “return to learn” plan. The plan is fine, however recent FB postings of school sanctioned activities with no masks & no social distancing makes me pause. I will make whatever sacrifices are necessary for my children to learn from home #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump and the Republican party- abortion is a sin and it's murdering babies. Also Trump and the Republicans- We are completely reopening schools this fall and we don't care if kids die due to the virus. The hypocrisy here. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump doesn’t care about the 135,000 Americans that have died on his watch. His cronies have been released from prison due to the coronavirus. Do you really think he cares about our children?#NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump is like the mayor of Amity Island in the movie Jaws. Demanding schools open is like demanding the beaches open #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump wants schools open so he can say things are opening up. Trump thinks that opening schools and opening the economy will help his re-election bid. Trump does not think about the children at all.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Understand, that it's NOT just about what your kid(s) knows.... It's actually more about what all the other kids know.  If you don't understand this... than you have ZERO business #homeschooling your kid(s)  #SchoolChoice #schools #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	We would all feel very different about schools reopening if we had a goverment that: -Was trustworthy -Had best interest of children as only motivation  -Based on Science  -provided necessary resources to ALL schools -had a National plan   None of these is true   #NotMyChild
20200717	1	When @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany was pushing @realDonaldTrump's agenda to reopen schools, did I really hear her say, “The science should not stand in the way of this"?  Or am I drunk, high, in a coma...?  #kayleighlies #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpKillsUs #MAGA #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	When my 5 yr old nephew sees a mask in our hands he asks if we're going somewhere, he reminds his big brothers to bring a mask when they leave the house. He's adapted. He was excited to start school this year, but I'd rather homeschool all of them than send them in.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	When trump says,"You don't have to wear a mask." I'm wearing a mask. When trump says"Covid is a hoax." I know it's real. When trump says"Beaches,bars &casinos must open." I'm staying home.  When trump insists,"Children should go to school," during a pandemic. I shout #NotMyChild
20200717	1	While you are living on the fantasy of "make America great again" and thinking these billionaires will save your low income soul, some of us are in reality.  This school year will be a disaster #school #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpFailsAmerica #notmykid #SchoolReopening
20200717	1	Who thinks that #Trump cares even a tiny bit about the health of kids returning to school when he cut the #healthcare from his brother's baby son who suffered from seizures so that he'd get a bigger inheritance?? #schools #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening #schools
20200717	1	Y'all have the highest school shooters numbers and the highest #COVID19 numbers but y'all want kids to go back to school.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Yes, let's explode suicides and ignore the pediatricians that say in-person classes are essential to children's health. Open the schools. #OpenSchools
20200717	1	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back #NotMyChild
20200717	1	‘Science should not stand in the way of opening schools.’ From our #QueenOfLies, @PressSec #schools
20200717	1	“The science should not stand in the way of this.”  That is the quote from this administration in regard to forcing children back into school whether it’s safe or not. How can you possibly vote for this man again? #vote #TrumpFailedAmerica #Biden2020 #SchoolReopening
20200717	2	#TrumpFailedAmerica  and  the #TrumpVirus  is running rampant through America.  #NotMyChild

20200717	2	DeVos and trump can speak of reopening schools all they want. #NotMyChild

20200717	2	The moment I saw the press conference live streaming to reopen schools I was thinking #NotMyChild
20200717	2	This is nothing but the truth. Did Twitter censure the bounty Hoax tweet Trump put out, no they didn’t & that tweet is a total lie. NATO and allies were briefed along with Trump himself. So no, @TwitterSupport, this video speaks the truth & nothing is embellished.  #NotMyChild
20200717	2	Vaccine or no vaccine were BACK I quote the Dotard in the oval office  #NotMyChild

20200717	2	Wow. The #TrumpMurder was worse than I thought.  His #TrumpVirus is killing thousands.  He is trying to kill as many as possible with a systematic #TrumpGenocide . How many have to die before he is stopped. #NotMyChild
20200717	2	You won’t be wearing those because our nurses and doctors need them. A cloth mask won’t kill you and it’s the nice thing to do. I think your religion says it’s Christ like. #WearADamnMask #WearAMask #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpFailedAmerica #NotMyChild
20200718	0	Dear @GavinNewsom , what exactly is the #science behind your decision to unilaterally shut down schools? That's what's supposed to drive your response, right? #antiscience #OpenSchools
20200718	0	Start protesting parents and everyone who wants the Economy to be stable.  The pandemic is not as bad as initially thought.  Every child should be allowed to go to school as normal.  Face masks also make zero sense.  99.95 chance of survival and rising!   #OpenSchools
20200718	1	#coronavirusus Most California schools will not reopen for in-person education this fall, governor says #CoronaVirus #Covid19 #pandemic #InfectiousDisease #CoronaVirusUpdate #california #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	-thats the end of it. I'm not risking my grandparents lives over your own greedy needs. you're supposed to keep us SAFE, not put us out in HARM. we are not your puppets for you to throw around and pick up whenever you need something. KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200718	1	2. or quitting my job of 20 years during a time when it's almost impossible to find another. Guess that's life nowadays #TrumpFailsAmerica #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	2020 school year: Teachers should be paid $1M a week! We don’t give them enough credit! They’re amazing! July: Fuck teachers! Students need to go back to school. We can just replace the teachers when they die, the economy is more important! #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	38,000 Covid cases in California of children under 17.  How many deaths? ZERO.  Maybe if you try to study and understand data you won't be so fearful. Old and sickly people die, not kids.   #hermosa #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	@mlkhattar @anilvijminister @cmohry @ceoharyana @AmitShah don’t you think by attending these online classes on mobiles & laptops for good long hours, the kids are loosing eyesights ? Pls release some guidelines for schools. #OnlineClasses #schools
20200718	1	And to the Florida of California -  @OCDeptofEd wants to send children back to school with no masks and no social distancing so my question is this:  Why would you risk the health and well-being of our children? #NotMyChild
20200718	1	Are you a teacher? You think that will happen? It will not. Children tend to not listen in school from my Teaching pre-3rd then older 7th. I can't get behind your logic at all. Teacher will spend the day Keep your masks on wash your hands..not so close..unbelievable. #NotMyChild
20200718	1	Bottom line for most California parents: your kids will be learning from home again in August, September, and maybe beyond. A tough challenge for many working families, not to mention teachers. #Coronavirus #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools
20200718	1	Don’t Experiment on our kids @GovTimWalz! Open Schools, Op Minnesota! #OpenSchools
20200718	1	Even if a vaccine was released tomorrow, I still would not send my child to school!  #NotMyChild
20200718	1	FYI-Higher density areas like Toronto will not enter phase 3 until sometime in August, which means we dont really get results on co-vid 19 infection rates until almost the start of September.  Cutting it close. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Fellow #teachers/#educators: You can make sneezeguards for your desk (if kids are eating breakfast/lunch in your classroom like at our district) with PVC pipe, zip-ties, and plexiglass/acrylic sheets. Waaaay cheaper than what they have on Amazon. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Hogwash.  #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	How much do you trust people who don't know the difference between "reply" and "reply all" to not spread something around in school? #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	I want an answer to this question! Journalists, KEEP ASKING. #BARON #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	I'll keep saying it. We'll let you have the children in your family attend our public school against CDC Guidlines & after a month you can let us ALL know how that turns out for you. You'll push anything for your own benefit, because your  not doing it for ours. #COVID19 #schools
20200718	1	If @realDonaldTrump is confident sending Barron back to school, it is because they live in DC where people have been taking the virus seriously and masking up for months. He would not send his kid back to school if they lived in a backwards red state. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	If the kids will not be returning to school this fall, please remove the school bonds and levies from my property taxes. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	If you are pushing for students to go back to the public school setting, your kids should be attending public schools as well.  And while we are at it, if you're pushing for reopening, you should be volunteering as a substitute teacher/support staff  #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	If you don’t work in a school/education  go ahead and take a seat! We all miss our students b/c we love them... that’s why we are not about to put them at risk of getting sick or worse! In-person school is not worth the risk of something happening to our babies!! #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	If you “follow the science” it does not take you to “open our schools.” If that morally doomed infant you spawned was old enough to attend school you know damn well you’d keep it home. See #NotMyChild
20200718	1	Interested to learn about these modifications for special needs students---virtual and in class.  #cerebralpalsy #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	It's after day one that you don't give a shit.  #KidsInCages #schools
20200718	1	Kids need to brave the pandemic and return to school ASAP so future Republicans can also have educated people to ignore. #RepublicansAreKillingUs #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica #RepublicansAreTheProblem #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200718	1	My daughter goes to Dayton public schools and last year she had to sit in science class with no teacher the entire year. They gave them a packet and left them alone for the day. How will this year look??? This is going to be a disaster. SMH #NotMyChild
20200718	1	My mom has been a #teacher for 38 years, & I  can say with all confidence that she would risk her own life for her class bc she loves the profession so much.  But should she have to? When some planning & studies could prevent #Covid_19  illness & death?! #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Not surprising, nearly all my teacher school staff friends aren’t for starting the year in person. And yes, we miss the students but want everyone to stay healthy. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Ok, since they’re so much controversy w/ opening schools and the safety of our children, open schools for all the parents who think COVID is a hoax  and refuse to wear masks...use them as guinea pigs, wait a few weeks and then see how they feel then.  #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Parents need to know all so they can make informed decisions and plans. Its multi faceted with caveats. #ontpoli #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Paul Ryan, millionaire white Republican, has 3 kids: Liza Ryan, 18, Charles, 17, and Samuel Ryan, 15.  I wonder if he will be sending them to school in a few weeks. He’s made no statement condemning the decision by his party to reopen schools. #GOPkids #notmykid #NotMyChild
20200718	1	Remember back in March when the left railed against closing schools because of marginalized students?  Good times. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Same in Germany: "Soap" is the "new concept" and "same classmates whole day" is an "hygiene measure".  Don't believe your kids are safe!  #EducationButSafe #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Schools will not be able to remain open with such poor Pediatric testing capacity. Today we strongly urge for a systematic strategy for widespread, efficient and rapid Pediatric testing in Philadelphia and around the nation. #CovidTesting #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	So my question with school openings is why the insistence to immediately open as X date? That approach was taken with the economy it was phased. Why not phase open the schools, based on conditions? Let’s start a conversation. #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	Sorry my good man @ChrisCuomo but in Montreal we are opening up schools again. It’s not a problem to make plans when you get the spread under control. #schools
20200718	1	The mental health of our students and teachers should be a top priority for all schools moving forward. Covid-19 has had an impact on everyone's mindset. We may not be able to tell what everyone is going through. Be kind! #SEL #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	This is heartbreaking. Someone not named Trump or DeVos needs to come up with a safe plan or just have all schools online or home school. This is our Future. #NotMyGrandchild #NotMyChild
20200718	1	This will not work! Kids are carriers and could bring in covid19. Too many parents are in groups and we will not know that. It easy for people like Gina to say when her kids don't go to overcrowded schools! @GovRaimondo @CDCgov #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	We all know that opening schools during a raging killer pandemic is criminal and crazy. #NotMyChild
20200718	1	We should all be terrified that @realDonaldTrump is blocking @CDCgov from testifying on reopening schools. He’s sacrificing the lives of kids, teachers & school staff & he doesn’t want us to know. This. Is. Happening. #NotMyChild

20200718	1	Wouldn’t it be amazing if #coronavirus and what looks bad—not going to school—meant our public educ- indoctrination got cleaned up? Let’s not go back to what we had before! #SchoolReopening

20200718	1	Young people can get Covid and die from it, even without other medical conditions. But even if they have it and aren’t sick, they can still be spreaders.  Make masks MANDATORY. It’s the least we can do. Don’t reopen schools yet. It’s too early.  #WearAMask #SchoolReopening
20200718	1	an intelligent approach to reopening the schools and this country safely. It will be the doctors & the scientists who should be leading any decision this admin makes. This statement by this lying spokes model just makes me furious. #Resist #fascisttrump #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200718	2	Deflecting any way you can so people don't notice that over 138,000 Americans have died because you have failed to do anything during this pandemic except useless, nonsense tweeping. #EnemyOfThePeople #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsKillingUs #NotMyChild
20200718	2	I’m just waiting for Trump to repurpose one of his old gems for the current national crisis: “I like people who weren’t deathly ill with a highly infectious disease.” #TrumpFailedAmerica #WearAMask #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie #COVID19 #FlunkTrump #NotMyChild

20200719	1	Absolutely not. No child's safety or future should rely on the advice of someone who hates Americans, works for Russians & fails to even support our families in a pandemic, or our troops  in a war zone. #TraitorInChief #TrumpIsNotWell #schools #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #schools
20200719	1	All we can do is follow protocol other Countries have used with success. Schools have had plenty of time to prepare.  #SchoolReopening
20200719	1	Also by forcing the students to be physically present, they are saying it’s safe, when all the sciences suggest otherwise? It is a STEM program, where the S stands for Science. #SchoolReopening
20200719	1	Anxious to see what our school system has come up w for back to school plans. If distance learning isn’t an option I’ll have to homeschool. My son also has an IEP so I would have to know what they plan to provide for that. This whole situation is a giant mess. #SchoolReopening

20200719	1	I hope school districts are prepared for massive lawsuits when they open up these schools and the COVID runs rampid. These are lives we are talking about. I understand it isn’t a death sentence, but schools are not meant for these guidelines.. #COVID #SchoolReopening
20200719	1	I saw that. This is yet another reason why we can't open schools. These anti-mask folks ruin gains made, even work in schools and have kids. No way would I want my kid sitting next to some whacked out anti-mask kid or get an anti-mask teacher. #NotMyChild
20200719	1	Interesting how schools main purpose (education) seems to be overshadowed by all the other things they pick up slack of. #SundayThoughts #SchoolReopening

20200719	1	Some terrific thoughts on school reopening from @RepPressley on #CNNSOTU - Congress must pass the #HeroesAct and fund public education if we want safe in-person learning. #SchoolReopening
20200719	1	The Republican party wants dead children.  #Covid19 #schools
20200719	1	Trump and Republicans WONT EVEN ALLOW THE CDC to give America guidelines to reopen schools. Republicans won’t fund what schools need to be safe. 138,000 deaths aren’t enough? You want to sacrifice our kids too? #NotMyChild
20200719	1	We are fine with opening schools with a PLAN, mandatory masks, contact tracing, onsite testing with same day results, required social distancing. PPE for teachers, staff, janitors, etc. It requires MONEY and the do-nothing GOP will provide none of that. #NotMyChild

20200720	1	@CMOPb @VijayIndrSingla If govt can't solve d problem of school fees, let d schools to be reopen. If parents have to pay fees forcefully, y not to send children schools. Then schools will see how to tackle wid corona problem. REOPEN D SCHOOLS FROM AUGUST 2020. #SchoolReopening

20200720	1	I spent the last few days visiting with friends and family in yards and feeling safe doing so because they are the only people I see. If they send us back to school, I can’t do those things and I worry that my mental health will deteriorate. #COVID19 #schools

20200720	1	I’m all for following CDC guidelines, but honestly, completely closing schools will only hurt disadvantaged communities. People who can’t afford extra tutors or in-person, engaging help will fall behind and perpetuate the cycle that holds underprivileged people down. #schools
20200720	1	Just wondering. First there's the lead up to the Chris Wallace interview. Then there's thousands of tweets & TV clips about the CW interview.  Guess, it's a slow news day.  #Portland #COVID19 #BountiesOnSoldiers #PPEShortages #ChildrenStillInCages #ReopeningSchools
20200720	1	Keep in mind: "no country that closed schools has attempted to reopen them with outbreaks still raging as they are across much of America." Our kids and staff are not safe bc of patchwork safety net that isn't safe. #SchoolReopening

20200720	1	Not everyone has the luxury to #workfromhome. I’d have been working at a hospital or research lab in my former life & keeping my kids at home wouldn’t have been an option becauseKids need to know us adults are doing our best whether we can #stayathome or not. #SchoolReopening

20200720	1	On Thursday, district will officially announced its plan for schools reopening. They were considering delaying the start date (Aug. 10) by 2 weeks or continuing with original plans. We're all on the edge of our seats waiting. #SchoolReopening
20200720	1	Reopening in June was an historic blunder that cost us thousands of lives and billions of dollars. That's hard to admit, so hard that most politicians haven't. Reopening schools in August or September will only compound that mistake. #SchoolReopening
20200720	1	School reopening in Michigan isn't for the social, emotional, cognitive welfare of children. 45 is worried about the polls which show him losing to #Biden  45 threatens to withhold 10% funding.  We would rather see our children 100% COVID free. #KeepYourChildHome #schools

20200720	1	Today on #MTP Dr. Michael Osterholm, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy said #schools do not have the resources or personnel they need to reopen this fall. Why is this still a debate? Continue #distancelearning #SchoolReopening
20200720	1	Want #teachers to put their health at risk?  1. Hazard pay 2. No deductibles or copays on Medical ins. 3. Air filtration systems in every room 4. All digital learning. No physical paper. All books digital also 5. All PPE provided by schools. No reuse.  #SchoolReopening
20200720	1	We shouldn't worry that our kids will "fall behind" the common core standards, we should worry that they will watch their teachers, paras,  support staff, families and schoolmates DIE from COVID. Trust me, that will be much harder to mitigate on the back end. #SchoolReopening
20200720	1	What say you, Donald J Duck? You happily sending your kid back to school in six weeks? Ya know, like the rest of us peons are being forced to do? #TrumpThreatensAmerica #schools
20200720	1	Wow,  I kind of love it.  That is a good use for those desk. #SchoolReopening
20200720	1	Yes! This should include educators being asked to return to the classroom in the middle of a pandemic that is not under control. Schools must be online only until we have testing and tracing fully in place. #teachersareessential #WeStandTogether4SafeSchools #NotMyKid #NotMyChild

20200721	1	@GovParsonMO. Sorry but you are uninformed. Kids who get #COVIDー19 at #schools spread it home to grandparents, parents, siblings, relatives with medical issues, not to mention their #teachers. EVERYONE wants kids back in school, but it isn't realistic now. #SchoolReopening

20200721	1	The “hybrid” model of reopening schools:  Rather than ask teachers to take 2 bullets today, we’re going to keep them safe by asking them to take only 1 bullet today, and then 1 more bullet tomorrow. But they should be fine b/c we’re spacing out the bullets.  #ReopeningSchools

20200721	1	Why on Gods green earth would we provide MORE money (In addition to the 300Billion+) to schools/districts when they are choosing not to open?   Provide our children with the Education they deserve. Enough, we can’t allow the cure to be worse than the cause! #KAG #OpenSchools
20200721	1	Will govt provide #pei #teachers w #lifeinsurance that pays out in the event of #covid19 #death?  This, is the very least we can do, imo #peipoli #cdnpoli #cdnhealth #schools
20200721	1	With school reopening approaching I am curious how #physed teachers feel ab the high # of possible exposure events seeing all or the majority of your school’s students. What are your schools doing to protect you aside from masks & distancing? #physicaleducation #SchoolReopening
20200721	1	idk bout y’all, but i don’t want to go to school this fall. dying because of a virus is such a lame way to go. come on, i want the time to make it epic #coronavirus #SchoolReopening

20200722	1	Academics is minor compared to an appreciation for arts. That's what the Left told us. So give kids extracurricular enrichment at a morning session in an outdoor setting. "Boring" homework can be done on the laptop at home. We are told it doesn't matter anyway. #SchoolReopening
20200722	1	Any teachers or parents that think of children as “dirty little bastards” shouldn’t be around the schools anyhow. Adults have no problem sharing drug paraphernalia and protesting in the street or going to Lowe’s, but “we may get sick from sending kids to school”  #OpenSchools

20200722	1	Fed up of seeing these comments of ‘sunbathing teachers’ ‘teachers have been on holiday’ ‘they’ve not done any work’.  If you lived with one, you’d know how unfair these comments are.  Maybe others should have a pay rise too, but don’t blame teachers for it.  #teachers #schools
20200722	1	Gotta say, my daughter loves online school because she’s not being made fun of everyday & her mental health has improved so much her Dr. thought she should continue even if they opened the schools up.  #NotMyChild
20200722	1	I love to see that it’s not just teachers that are thinking about safety w this hashtag: #IfSchoolsReopenNow .. even the students are old enough to understand social distancing ain’t gonna work.. listen to the people..open safely. #uft #nycdoe #ReopeningSchools
20200722	1	I say make the teachers go to those buildings to teach their remote learning.  Make them work at least an 8 hour day and not sit at home and get side jobs or watch Netflix.  They can wear masks and social distance.  #OpenFCPS #OpenSchools
20200722	1	I work with kids , just received the message that no one signed up for classes so I am still furloughed . Can t say that I blame them . I wouldn’t want my kids health in jeopardy especially if they are forced to go to school in Aug. #COVID19 #schools

20200722	1	Okay, so is the provincial government going to make any MANDATORY PAID sick days to the parents that need to take time off thier jobs to look after a sick kid? That would be one thing....  #ableg #abed #SchoolReopening
20200722	1	Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"  #NotMyChild

20200722	1	So my little cousin’s school was re-opening, and he was to return to his grade 2 class. His class consisted of 30 students. So 15 were chosen to come on alternate days. So he goes the first day, and besides him only one other student shows up ..  #ReopeningSchools
20200722	1	Sooo.. #COVID19 is so contagious we release inmates from prison...but safe enough that we can send our children back to school.  Dangerous enough that we're still on lockdown. But safe enough to jeopardize the lives of our babies?  #IRefuse #SendBaron #NotMyChild

20200722	1	We don't know if many kids will be crippled for life by the plague yet. In 20 years we'll probably have a good idea about how seriously we should have kept kids safer at home for another year until the vaccine will hopefully be available.  #CloseTheSchools
20200722	1	What bothers me most is the decision makers that say school needs to restart but not for their kids. #SchoolReopening
20200722	1	Yes, mental health is critical. Sadly, with all of the safety measures, it might be even worse at school. No sitting near friends at any time will be incredibly challenging. No perfect solution. #SafeSchools #ReopeningSchools

20200724	1	@gisdnews for midddle and high school, have a home room and rotate teachers. A lot easier to keep teachers and their areas clean, than worry about moving kids from class to class. Let’s make it happen. #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	@mabena_bob @FaithMangope #powerbreakfast #Covid_19 showed that equality is something that we won't have in SAfrica am so hurt to see that we are very different, we have poor people an we have rich people an now we have to be like rich people will take kids to #schools
20200724	1	@realDonaldTrump SCHOOLS MUST BE CLOSED! Classes must be virtual! You get tested twice or more daily! Anyone who will be near you MUST BE TESTED! School staff, faculty, teachers, & children doesn’t have that privilege! More people/children will die  @BetsyDeVosED #NotMyChild
20200724	1	And he wants to force schools to reopen. #NotMyChild
20200724	1	Apparently, schools need to be open to help diagnose abuse and provide mental health services.  Ummm...anyone know how they do that without counselors?  Asking for hundreds of districts.  #ReopeningSchools

20200724	1	Dear U.S. journalists: Please (if you haven't already!) compile a list of every single member of the GOP - from the top on down - whose kids and/or grandkids won't be attending in person school when it "opens." I'm sure that idiot from Florida isn't the only one. #SchoolReopening

20200724	1	Everyone wants kids back in school for many reasons. Teachers want to be there just as badly! Just wishing it so doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. It has to be done safely! Rising daily numbers? That does not signal a time to reopen under scenario 1. #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	Fuk the Teachers Unions. Get Subs in there. Kids will learn Better and Faster anyway. Teachers will be Begging to Come Back. #ReopeningSchools
20200724	1	Government are right re: schools reopening. No point in drip feeding every day. No doubt there will be comprehensive announcement in the coming week or two.  (Sounds like a government announcement!) #SchoolReopening

20200724	1	How many parents have the option of doing virtual learning and getting paid their full pay? Many people do and that is why ”most” parents will not send them to school. They will tell their company they have no child care. #lazypeoplesuck #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	I appreciate your 2 cents on this! If you can come up with a nickel you can sponsor ONE (1) kid to return to school! #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	I expect that an upcoming round of stories by education reporters will focus on the unusually large numbers of #teachers and staff NOT planning to return for the 2020-21 school year, especialy  those planning in-person instruction. #ReopeningSchools #schools
20200724	1	I just want everyone to know that the recommendation from my pediatrician is to keep my kids at home if at all possible. #NotMyKid #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	I think Teachers should go protest for reopening the schools too soon and they also have the opportunity of demand more money. A teacher salary should start at 80k #teacher #schoolsreopening #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools

20200724	1	My 4-year-old daughter Brooklyn was using her face mask at home as a slingshot with her Easter eggs back in March or April. Kids in school will definitely think of this too. It's amusing but I had to bring it up. Teachers are going to have their hands full. #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	No school is worth attending if it means your kid’s/kids’funeral, memorial service or cremation will be held w/in about 3 wks, more or less because of it!   #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200724	1	Oh, it’s going to be “a safe reopening of the schools.”   We can all stop worrying. Donald Trump says it will be safe, so it will be safe because he says so. When has he ever been wrong before?  What is his strategy? That it will be safe. Simple.    #TrumpsAmerica #OpenSchools

20200724	1	Per @bharzuaga School committee discussing reopening schools: “How do we keep windows/doors open for air circulation to prevent COVID but also keep doors closed & locked to keep kids from potentially getting shot by a school shooter?” This is America. #SchoolReopening

20200724	1	Reopen schools based on the data.  Lowest risk first.  But must re-open.  #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	Reopening schools in a few weeks... will teachers be eligible for workers’ comp when COVID infects us? I’m heading back in a few weeks with protections like “recommended distancing when possible”. Who will sub for sick teachers? This is crazy. #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
20200724	1	School board members are holding ZOOM MEETINGS from the safety of their own  living rooms to decide if it’s SAFE to send kids & teachers back into classrooms together in three weeks MAKE IT MAKE SENSE #Covid_19 #COVID #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	School closures particularly difficult for many children who don’t have access to digital tools, data, a television or radio. It also means that they are not able to access psychosocial support and safe spaces at school. #cyrilramaphosa #schools
20200724	1	Schools opening? Depends where you live. Miami or Houston? Not a chance, middle of West Virginia? It can be done. Not a black and white issue and definitely not a red or blue issue. #ReopeningSchools
20200724	1	Seriously?! Meanwhile, back in America, #Trump insists children must attend school in person. #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	She called the woke state school system's bluff: She set up her own school. Made hard by the hatred she got for doing it. #Leftie teacher mobs outside the school meant they had to hire a bouncer. Can you believe it? Teachers hating a teacher for success! #UK #BlackKids #schools
20200724	1	So the occupants son , Baron’s private school won’t be open, but he wants to send your kids to school. Stop being stupid people. He will put your kids in danger, but not his.  #noschool #Covid_19 #coronavirus #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200724	1	So when are you, Trump and the GOP going to care about keeping kids safe?  #CloseTheSchools
20200724	1	So... I just want to make sure I understand this - The people who want to open schools to in person learning have now CANCELLED part of their convention because it is not safe to gather in person...  #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown #schools
20200724	1	Thank you @fordnation and @Sflecce for the announcements this morning about investing and renovating new and old schools across Ontario. Looking forward to hearing the plans for September next week. #investingineducation #SchoolReopening

20200724	1	The assumption is all kids are healthy in the US and that’s a bad assumption #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	The entire premise is wrong. There is NO way to teach in full PPE. There is NO way kids keep masks on for 7 hours. Has anyone talking about these things EVER stepped foot inside a classroom to teach?? #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200724	1	Then why are schools being forced to open if he is so caring? #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200724	1	Throwing bodies at the virus for the sake of money isn't going to make it go away. That's obvious, but you're okay with doing it anyway.  That's somebody's mother, father, grandparents, aunt, uncle, son, or daughter that you're willing to sacrifice for money.  #SchoolReopening

20200724	1	Um, can I just say that parents are responsible for their kids mental health too. It's summer. School wouldn't be in session anyway. If your kid is having challenges, don't wait til school starts to get them help. #TrumpPresser #TrumpPressConference #TrumpPressBriefing #schools
20200724	1	Under any other possible human being to lead it, this country would be the adult in the room and shut down the schools completely indefinitely — ”until we clean up our room”, so to speak. Alas, we only have in unqualified babysitter in charge. #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	We wait for a plan in Germany as well- There is not much yet- facemask whilst walking through the building, opening windows- let me think- thats barely it! #ReopeningSchools
20200724	1	What about the kids are being forced to go back to school because their parents are virus/pandemic deniers? Our kiddos are more aware than some give them credit for. That’s not an environment that promotes learning. That’s an environment that can create PTSD. #CloseTheSchools
20200724	1	What was @Sflecce saying about admin not being allowed to hire people from racialized backgrounds? Is he scrapping #reg274 or is he just overstepping for affirmative action? #onted #onpoli #SchoolReopening
20200724	1	When politicians commit to spend a week in winter in a small room with 30 ppl at a time, up to 200 diff ppl per day & no social distancing, staff will know it is safe to reopen schools full time. Until then, #UpdateYourWill @EISUnion @JohnSwinney @NicolaSturgeon #SchoolReopening

20200724	2	Schools should've taught us the synonyms for "very very", "really really" and "so so" and what should we use while using fillers like: "uhhhhhh", "like", "mmmm" instead of (a+b)². #englishvocabulary #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200725	0	Absolutely, those who are comfortable with proper protocols should be able to bring their kids fir 5 days schools. Those not comfortable can home school. If daycares, walmart, target, stop n shoo, barbers n nail  salons can figure out waysto open so should schools ! #OpenSchools
20200725	0	Fee reduction can be implemented but to stop schools to collect fees completely is not fair & not just teachers or schools but even parents are against this order. #SaveOurSchools

20200725	0	Why should schools stay closed? None of these kids are social distancing or wearing mask there all on beaches, lake's and hanging out in parking lots in crowd's. They all believe this virus is only older people so let them go to school  #OpenSchools

20200725	1	After all that #2020 has put us through, pls when school reopens, let's forget all this school father, mother, children and relative BS, the year gave you enough time to grow up. #schoolsreopening #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	Although, this is a decision made by the school boards and superintendents, they are feeling pressure to reopen due to the threat of defunding.   The children should not have to undergo an experiment without knowing the outcome.  This will not end well.  #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	And yes, I've decided to homeschool & I know that's not an option for everyone, but it's very blasé to say "Just keep your kid home" because those kids & teachers will be spreading it to their families & others & into the community. Reopening schools is a big mistake. #NotMyChild
20200725	1	Are you saying that because teachers aren’t physically in a classroom,they aren’t working and teaching, going to the school, doing lesson plans, having to learn new technology and trying to make sure their students have access? #SchoolReopening

20200725	1	I didn’t realize DT maliciously hid the CDC recommendationthat NO SCHOOLS should open. How can anyone in education ignore experts? Hoping school districts send a clear message to politicians NOT to play politics w/our children. This is not a good experiment. #CloseTheSchools
20200725	1	I just cannot understand how the Trump admin (and now CDC) can’t seem to acknowledge that children tend to live with grownups who could get very sick if their asymptomatic angels infect them. Mind-blowing. #gaslighting #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	I know it may be surprising to some, but students don't teach themselves in schools. #ReopeningSchools
20200725	1	If schools don't open funding should go to the parents!?!?  1) They are open, it's virtual 2) Where is the excess capacity for these kids if they leave their current school?  This is as smart as arm the teachers. @EricTrump level smart.  #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200725	1	If you fail to protect a child that is called neglect. Any parent that sends their child back to school in the middle of this #TrumpVirus should be charged accordingly. I would be in jail, no way in hell would I put mine in known danger. #schoolsreopening #COVID19 #NotMyChild

20200725	1	Online last spring students who read, read; students who don't, didn't. Going back to classrooms doesn't address worsening inequities if students can't access appropriate resources and teachers can't implement effective practices. Let's talk how #nsed #literacy #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	Reminder: If you are upset because school will be remote this 2020-2021 year (and it will be the entire year), don't blame schools and teachers. Blame POTUS and the federal government who did little to get this pandemic under control. #SchoolsMustShutdown #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	School children should be tracing - not contact tracing  Distance learning is safe & smart  #ReopeningSchools
20200725	1	Schools aren't ready.I know when my children get sick i always quarantined them in rooms.Yet I still get it We knw It goes thru the household maybe kids are more ASymptomatic for now until it mutates again & Give it to Others, Teachers,Staff it'll spreads over & over. #NotMyChild
20200725	1	Schools must reopen. No question. Government will outline policy for reopening schools with no social distancing while insisting on being socially distanced in the Convention Centre at a cost of €25,000/day to the taxpayer. #Hypocrisy #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	Schools: closed at 10.000 cases Also schools: reopen at +1M cases #SchoolReopening
20200725	1	So baseball, which happens in a HUGE outdoor area, can’t have fans, but let’s cram 30 kids and a teacher into a small room with no ventilation and that’s okay!?! #SchoolReopening

20200725	1	The best Congress could do for schools is provide funds for IPads & tax credits for Internet providers to furnish wi-fi in hot spots. Short of that, either staggered schedules to allow for distancing or in person instruction for young kids & online for older kids #SchoolReopening

20200726	2	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light  #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits. #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	When govt can’t raise the bar of government schools it tries to sabotage pvt education. @jigneshmevani80 please help and #SupportTeachers #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	When we teach our students online, we teach them with 100% chapter clarity, we are covering up 100% syllabus. So its not only about cost bare by schools. Its about their teachers' 100% dedication. So i think the comparison is not correct. #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	Which other sector has been banned from providing services or collecting revenue?  So liquor shops, malls, all were poor hand-to-mouth and show must go on for them; while all schools have been doing is exploit parents! Is that how schools have been perceived #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	While schools planned to keep learning going for children, little did they know govt was working on cutting them from the source.  Whose intention do we trust here?  Choose your side wisely parents, it’s about your kid’s future, not temporary evasion of expense! #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	While we teach our children to accommodate to the new normal, do you seriously foresee it as a society without schools! Is that what you want us to teach them?  That’s what “No Fees” directive indicate  #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	Why don’t the small percentage of parents who feel that online education is useless withdraw their children from private schools and admit them in free govt. schools with highly paid and qualified teachers? Why make majority of parents and students suffer? #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	Yes.... you mentioned right Sir. #schools but now we need to #SaveOurSchools our schools are shutting and so will our bread and butter. No fees is not a solution. #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	save schools save teachers  #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	what forced government to take this step? 1.schools even after pay cut to teachers, not even talking about cut in fees 2.expenses like electricity,stationary,contact pays are saved and benefit not transferred to students.  #SaveOurSchools

20200727	1	@WGNMorningNews @JBPritzker @ABC7Chicago What is the plan to protect student-teachers that will lose their health benefits this Fall? COVID protection policy? Anything? Wasn’t sweating it until the house took a huge edge, my life is the gamble? #teacher #COVID #schools

20200727	1	A large amount of students in NYC take public transportation (subway and buses) to and from school. This a great concern for New Yorkers when contemplating the possible spread of the COVID-19 virus. #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	A statue never taught a lesson. A teacher interpreting the statue did. Protect the teacher, not the statues.  #history #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	All state testing should be put on hold. School districts have all different restart plans that best suit their communities.None are starting off on the same footing,all things are not equal; so there is no #equity in standardized testing! #bfc530 #backtoschool #ReopeningSchools
20200727	1	Apparently @BriscoeCain switched parties, he's now a @TheDemocrats that thinks everyone needs to wear a #mask! It's really simple, if YOU'RE sick, flu, #coronavirus, #diarrhea, #stayhome, allow everyone else to live. #OpenSchools
20200727	1	Are all schools going to start offering after school clubs? Many after school care providers have stopped providing the services due the #COVID risk.   I know I will be affected when schools reopen as the lady who looked after by daughter has shut down.  #SchoolReopening

20200727	1	Concerned parents and teachers can kiss your a$$?? That is a vile response to concerns regarding the health and safety of faculty and students @SenJohnKennedy you should be called out and voted out. #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	Did you know there was a national school bus driver shortage BEFORE the pandemic?  Did you know some Districts had to close schools temporarily because there weren't enough drivers?  Driver's on-duty attendance is poor due to illness, harsh conditions, low pay  #ReopeningSchools
20200727	1	Disagree! Boards can take a stand! Directors could at least say the right thing to preempt the Govt! #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	Huh. Not to many, compared to all the worried parents, schools,teachers,and staff. @mngop , you don't even meet in person and hold legislative hearings on line. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200727	1	I'm sure in theory everything is been done to keep kids apart when they go back to school but the fun will start when the secondary kids leave the school gates at 16:00 hrs and head for home or coffee #schools

20200727	1	Now Cohen is getting released. Just so we keep the record straight I’d like to remind everyone Covid-19 has made prisons so dangerous that Manafort, Stone, and Cohen are not incarcerated. Meanwhile President Ding Dong is lobbying for kids to be in school. #NotMyChild
20200727	1	Reopening schools or not?  I have to say I’m really upset that I can’t get the education that I wanted. I can’t see my friends or take extra classes. Online school is frustrating. I still feel that it’s dangerous and not every school is prepared well enough. #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	Same politicians okay with school shootings also okay with sending kids back to school. Pass it on. #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	School has been fun and stressful at the same time. It's also fun seeing the teachers learn the reason technology is very important and not just bash it repeatedly  #SchoolReopening

20200727	1	To the parents worried about their children’s education if schools don’t reopen as normal in the fall: don’t worry. The six weeks in high school I spent learning IMAGINARY NUMBERS has yet to find any real-world applications in my life. #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	Waking up with the sense of anxiety & anticipation for the announcement due today on school reopening-looking forward to getting back-hope we can do this safely, somewhat confidently & not lose the ‘human’ side of the job - student interaction is so important  #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	We can take back our schools. We can unite to demand small cell home school programs. Hiring our own teachers, and get federal funding. If schools won’t open we can open for our children. School is an essential business. @PressSec @realDonaldTrump #SchoolReopening
20200727	1	Why do parents think that a school that doesn’t understand basic science or human decency is a good enough school to educate their kids? Clearly, if a school district is STUPID, what exact subject do you trust them to teach your kids?  Obituary writing? #COVIDIOTS #schools
20200727	1	is trump forgetting about school buses? on my bus SDing isn’t an option we usually sit 3 to a seat and having a mask won’t do anything when they’re sitting on my lap #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200727	2	Focus needs 2be on quality & accountability irrespective of who the provider is. It’s shocking that as per @CSF_India recent report that 75p of #students in urban India choose fee paying private schools over FOC Govt. Separate Govt role as provider & regulator #SaveOurSchools

20200728	1	Absolutely NOT.  If you are sick  STAY HOME! If you are in fear of catching something STAY HOME!  If you have a compromised immune system STAY HOME! If you scared to work or teach - STAY HOME!  The rest of us Americans will go on living life. #openNC #OpenAmericaNow #OpenSchools
20200728	1	All jokes aside I think it’s hilarious that schools are planning on opening. Y’all couldn’t keep head lice under control and y’all wanna open them up?! #coronavirus #ReopeningSchools
20200728	1	Are in-person schools safe?  My elementary Principal used to make the boys pull their pants down at the urinals so he could watch them pee. My 4th grade teacher was cuffed & removed from class permanently. My HS Principal planted drugs in my locker  #ReopeningSchools

20200728	1	I am assuming teachers still get paid whether school goes back or not, at the very least they will get unemployment, where they will make more than working, so of course they don’t want to go back! I would love to get paid more to stay home! #SchoolReopening #OpenSchools
20200728	1	I don’t know why we expected Republicans to swear the possibility that children could get infected with Covid-19 when they’ve been proudly announcing their indifference to being murdered in a mass shooting for decades. #ReopeningSchools

20200728	1	If schools don’t open this September, you are insane. Movie theatres are open, schools can too. Keep kids distanced, only half the class, and masks on. And you guys need a backup plan. #FireLecce #OpenSchools
20200728	1	If schools keep pushing back opening dates they might actually get to the dates that we began school when I was a kid.  #schools
20200728	1	If truly the FG is sincere about reopening of schools they should use final year students in tertiary institution to test run the rules put in place for reopening of schools #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	If we are shutting down schools we should be refunded any money taken to pay for schools on the state local and federal level.  Teachers make up a large number of those arrested rioting. I wont pay them for services they are too busy rioting to provide.  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200728	1	If you are still sitting in a virtual meeting to decide upon opening your school district instead of holding a meeting in a room face to face the answer is pretty clear to me. #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	It’s criminal that Lewis voted against vouchers for children of low income families. Bending to the demands of the unions. #JohnLewisMemorial #BLM #CNN #schools

20200728	1	One month enjoy your last month #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	One note :_  Children's / college students are badly vanishing about the school concept. As covid 19 situation the starting of schools has to be priority with norms. Education makes it all.  @BillGates #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	Re: School plans on PEI.  Today Dr. Morrison told us operational plans are being submitted on GROUPS of schools: ie: Elementary schools. Morrison says to expect an announcement from Education, @bradtrivers, in about a week. #PEICOVID19 #SchoolReopening

20200728	1	Sit in a movie theater for 2 hours - no too dangerous                                         Sit in a classroom for 7 hours - you will be fine   #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	So are the same parents that are anti-vax also demanding schools to be opened despite the possible risks? #Covid #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	So baseball had to stop playing games already but schools reopening will be totally fine, just fine #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200728	1	So many people have told me they are not sending their kids back to major universities due to elearning or their sports being canceled.  Maybe this will finally bring down college tuition.  I bet community college enrollment will triple. #endthelockdown #OpenSchools
20200728	1	So schools are delaying in-person instruction, but for $285/week, I’m allowed to send one child to camp to do their distance learning. What the actual fuck? #OpenSchools
20200728	1	So today I realized I was looking at the wrong website for my kids schools I’m an idiot. I was so happy thinking they was gonna do distance and now I’m back stressed, depressed and worried again. DAMNIT. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200728	1	Soooo, you are saying we need to not reopen schools because we need to protect our educators more than we protect our sports?  #TrumpIsKillingUs #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200728	1	Special needs just like me. I don’t want to put her teachers at risk. I don’t want to put her at risk. I don’t want to put the rest of the family at risk. We need to treat this as the deadly pandemic it is and do what needs to be done. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening

20200728	1	There is no "good" or "right" answer when deciding if kids should return for in person instruction.  There IS, however, a SAFE answer:  Stay home.  Wait.  Just wait.  Do the first 9 weeks online.  Use data, metrics, benchmarks.  Learn more.  Stay safe. #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	This press conference is a joke! No clarity or specifics ! #ReopeningSchools
20200728	1	To parents worried about having additional duties of teaching at home:  Remember, just because the schools don't do it, doesn't mean you can't legitimately teach your child about social studies using Star Wars.  You just have to be willing to put in the effort. #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	To send kids to school, or not send kids to school?  That is the question.  Which I need to answer this week cuz I need to enroll them one way or the other, and it’s stressing me out. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	When principals from various schools cant write a simple cheque or spell correctly. Next level concern. South Africa, TF!  #educationsystem #southafrica #schools

20200728	1	Who did you  will be more careful between students in secondary, primary and universities in terms of keeping to the rules of SD?. The FG has no interest in opening schools anytime soon, they're just beating about the bush as they always do. #SchoolReopening
20200728	1	Wonder wit all considering the opening of schools n August so how do kids who normally get the bus now travel 2 school not everything s been considered pods s way 2 go working on camps wit 15 kids in a group max #schoolsreopening #schools

20200729	1	@latimes Reported on 9 Jul that 83% of teachers who voted in LA were in favor of keeping schools closed. I wonder how that vote would have gone if keeping schools closed meant teachers would be furloughed. #schoolsreopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200729	1	A question for school boards considering reopening in-person... what happens when a kid pulls off someone else’s mask, or “fake-coughs”, or any number of things like this that kids do, because they are kids? #ReopeningSchools
20200729	1	Adults: let’s ALL be mindful that our children are watching and listening to us.  During these difficult times, we are modeling conflict resolution, problem solving, stress management skills for the next generation. #COVID19 #Children #schools

20200729	1	For schools to open we need to all be wearing masks. Makes sense but why are states that are insistent on reopening schools don't have a mask mandate? #masks #mandatemasks #ReopenSchools #ReopeningSchools
20200729	1	Forgive them first... then it's a case of all hands on deck! #ReopeningSchools
20200729	1	Great news! All of the kids and teachers I know are at schools that have chosen to do virtual learning for the first semester. Thank goodness for thoughtful, logical leadership in those schools who made the safety of their students and staff a priority.  #SchoolReopening
20200729	1	I have two freshmen heading to CT and MA. They are promising frequent testing and results in 36 hours or less. We'll see! #SchoolReopening
20200729	1	I often wondered y wud schools give assignments like 'best out of waste,' I mean what good will it lead to? But lately I realised that it is about teaching an important life skill - often you will have to make best out of worst (waste) in life. Learn early. #Parenthood #schools
20200729	1	In the midst of the furore of schools reopening spare a thought for some school secretary's who are paid barely above minimum wage. They receive no holiday pay or sick leave. Their workload in the coming months is going to be immense. #SchoolReopening
20200729	1	Just saw a news story covering parents and students protesting the proposed delay of the opening of school. I see their point: One student was carrying a sign that read, “Open Schools Without Ristrictions” (sic). #SchoolReopening

20200729	1	Poor students and teachers in TN. Gov. Lee has no strategy to protect either. Schools are going to become epicenters of Covid-19 outbreaks. Infected people will take the disease home and spread to their communities. This is a disaster waiting to happen. #TNCoronaUpdate #schools
20200729	1	Reading through a reopening plan.  It’s bullshit.  Worst thing is temp check “to be done by parent/guardian before school”. Some parents don’t have a good thermometer, some parents can’t use a thermometer and Parents can lie. The schools should do a temp check. #SchoolReopening
20200729	1	Since public schools like @FCPSKY have abandoned their duty of educating our children, Congress should consider a tax deduction for private school tuition. @senatemajldr @RepAndyBarr #schoolsreopening #schools

20200729	1	The debate is not actually about whether children should be in school. It’s about whether or not it’s fine for the families of all these children to get the virus.   Discussing school reopening details are a distraction from that conversation.   #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200729	1	This is the right choice, we just don't know enough about kids and #COVID19 and we can't risk the health of staff and the families they go home to.  #SchoolReopening

20200730	1	@GovRaimondo VT had 3 cases yesterday & hasn’t had a death in 6 weeks, but delayed their opening until Sept 8th. #ReopeningSchools
20200730	1	Barely holding it together.  School's back-to-school plan: live-stream class for those at home? Teach virtual & in class at the same time?  Not good for my mental health. Super anxious, highly stressed... #backtoschool #teacherproblems #teachertwitter #anxiety #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	But hey! LET’S OPEN SCHOOLS! #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200730	1	COVID-19 has reawakened our spirit of misdirected anxiety, inspiring businesses & families to obsess over risk-reduction rituals that make us feel safer but don’t actually do much to reduce risk—even as more dangerous activities are still allowed.This is hygiene theatre. #schools
20200730	1	Disrespected & devalued. Teacher bashing has been awful during pandemic & now @JohnSwinney @ScotGovEdu throw teachers under a bus to appease a vocal group of Covid deniers. Never felt more demoralised. @EISUnion invisible. Looking at job options.  #SafeAtSchool #ReopeningSchools
20200730	1	Does New Education Policy (NEP) stand on strong foundational pillars? #NewEducationPolicy #NewEducationPolicy2020 #educationpolicy2020 #EducationMinistry #india #ICAI #EducationNeverDies #educationsystem #Educationreforms #educationmatters #educationpolicy #colleges #schools
20200730	1	Drive by your schools and check for maintenance repairs. Mine will need quite a bit to accommodate washing. Then, of course sinks in the modular classrooms. There isn’t any running water in the portables. Maybe open some old schools? #ReopeningSchools
20200730	1	Has anyone asked the kids what they think? Had a young boy in my shop yesterday and he suggested that in his high school that the teachers move between most classes instead of kids to cut down the squash in halls and stairs I thought it was great idea from the wee guy! #schools
20200730	1	I hope our school districts have put some time into becoming more effective distance teachers. Our spring distance learning was a fail in my opinion, but there was probably no plan in place for our schools for this type of scenario.  Let’s be proactive VS reactive. #OpenSchools
20200730	1	I spent the last two days working with our Quality Improvement team to design the year ahead. I’m exhausted. I’m frustrated. I’m beginning to believe that no one has the answers to my questions. #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	If professional athletes have the availablity of frequent testing, so should students and teachers returning to school.#every4days #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	In a 3rd grade planning meeting and shared that a bill has been proposed to go full remote in NJ. The teachers' reaction?   Joy. Relief. Long gone smiles.   Shut it down, @GovMurphy . #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	Just wrote a public comment to BOE. Feeling nervous/anxious about the repercussions of my words, but knowing I said what I needed to say: Ultimately the only acceptable back to school plan is one that fully prevents the illness and death of children. #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	My daughter just now: I was talking with my freind.... even if 1 person dies, even if it’s not a close freind, just someone I’ve talked to once..... that’s going to be traumatic. What will you tell her @Sflecce ?   #SafeSeptember #onted #onpoli #ReopeningSchools
20200730	1	Our schools could open If we test and slow COVID Not by skipping steps #haiku #poetry #schools
20200730	1	S. Korean schools reported just 1 coronavirus infection after 2 months of reopening.   #COVID__19 #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	Since grown adults seem to have a hard time wearing masks- it’s the perfect time to expect children to wear them, in overcrowded classrooms. They won’t breathe all over each other, and go home to grandma, right??#bloodonyourhands #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200730	1	So the idea is that, Schools are too unsafe to open because Corona virus is too dangerous for teachers. What do they do? The same teachers gather in large groups to go protesting the opening of schools. ? This isnt about safety, its about $$$ #coronavirus @DonaldJTrumpJr #schools
20200730	1	Some of yall wanna reopen schools but forget that schools give out awards for perfect attendance and give out punishments/humiliation for even being a few minutes late  #COVID19 #coronavirus #schools
20200730	1	Teenagers are definitely losing their reading skills from not going to school.  I just met a group of five in the lobby.  Not one of the five could read either of the two signs that said, "Masks Required in Lobby and Elevator." #OpenSchools
20200730	1	Teens had a house party in NJ and now 50 have tested + for Covid-19. What do you think will happen when schools open? #govirtual #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	These are the choices teachers have to make right now. I’m angry that this is where we are as a society.  4/4 #SchoolReopening
20200730	1	The Times of London reported that one of the United Kingdom’s key epidemiologists has said nowhere in the world has it been reported a teacher caught COVID-19 from a student.  Nowhere in the WORLD!  Open up the schools.  #OpenSchools
20200730	1	Today’s Poll: Should schools open up or close this fall? #OpenSchools #closeschools #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200730	1	When in class VIII-IX (ICSE) we saw the range of subject availability for optional, it was mighty impressive. It was back in 1998-99. But in a small town like Talcher, only two were possible: economics & comp science. Just saying.. #NewEducationPolicy #NEP2020 #schools
20200730	1	Woe to the admin starting a new job and has to learn the kids’ names while they wear masks! #schoolsreopening #neadmin #Principals #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”  Really Mr. President????  Can you tell the same about opening of schools?  What about saying "Delay opening of schools until pupils can properly, securely and safely study???”  #Trump #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	"It doesn’t surprise me that Trump labeled school workers as ‘essential.’ It’s runaway capitalism. They have enough money for the Pentagon, but nothing for the people. Look at our health care. It’s a sham. Big Pharma & the insurance industry run it." - Laura, bus driver #schools
20200731	1	"Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy) around the country..."  Shamiana schools? #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	#Covid and #returntoschool  Rather than alternate days, split the schools into 2 shifts. 7:30 to 12:30 and 1:00 to 6:00. When there was a delay in school construction, there was a year when my high school was split in such a way. It worked well. #ontarioschools #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	#coronavirusus The Covid-19 infection rate across New York City has to be below 3% for schools to reopen, Mayor Bill de Blasio said  #CoronaVirus #Covid19 #pandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #usa #newyork #SchoolReopening

20200731	1	500 nurses will be hired. There are 3,948 elementary and 880 secondary schools in Ontario. I might be bad at math, but I think @fordnation and @Sflecce should be required to take that math proficiency test. Something doesnt add up. #onted #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	@Sflecce @fordnation I do not pretend to know the right decision regarding schooling - but can you please explain what will be done to help those who are hearing impaired needing to learn or deliver education in environments where masks are worn? #accessibility #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Adult humans are such slaves to routine. Ontario schools are not such great places to start with, think of the results, not exemplary despite billions spent on them. Children adapt, maybe some flourish online, w/o the social drama of schools. What's the rush? #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Anyone else getting ads for items to buy with your personal money to make your job safer during the pandemic or is your job normal? #teachers #EducationWithCOVID #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	A resource provided by the Ontario Music Educators’ Association with suggestions on how to teach the subject while limiting risk states that singers should be two metres apart and face forward rather than facing each other or practicing in a circle. #onted #SchoolReopening

20200731	1	Come mid October, wks before election, country wide, you could have 100k kids out/parents home, no $600/wk. Do you think all those parents-voters will look kindly on your current BS of kids have great immunity to CV19? #EvictTrump #TrumpFailedAmerica #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Crucial hearing of a petition filed by Federation of Private Schools in Gujarat will be conducted by Gujarat HC today. The body has challenged a notification asking them to not charge fees till actual teaching starts.   @ahmedabadmirror @imBhupendrasinh #SchoolReopening

20200731	1	Dear @fordnation please do not send high schoolers back to school unless you want covid cases to go up or make teenagers depressed. Sincerely, a senior in high school. #backtoschool #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Does research actually show that young children don't spread Covid-19?  I'm asking seriously.  I may not be up on the latest, but I thought the jury was out on this still? #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Fire them all and let them re apply . There are many applicants to take their place #AZ #schools
20200731	1	Good luck getting teachers and staff in schools. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	Has any journalist asked Dr Ronan Glynn and NPHET if they’re happy for 24 teenagers (Possibly more) to sit for hours together in stuffy classrooms without wearing masks? Would like to hear their thoughts on it...  #nphet #COVID19ireland #edchatie #ReopeningSchools
20200731	1	Have you guys seen the cat food commercial where the kid yells at his mom that he fell and is bleeding and she just sits there with her cat & yells back at him to get two Band-Aids? That’s who’s sending their kids back to school. #trumpvirus #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	How pathetic can we be as a country. We need to risk opening schools because so many children don’t get enough to eat if we don’t?  Does anyone else think this doesn’t add up?  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	I do not understand the national need for @MLB  Imagine what would happen if the @mlb would forgot their season and donate their stockpile of daily tests to their local #schools .... #BaseballisBack #safe #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	I don't wish for any kids to get sick, but for those suggesting opening, if it doesn't affect them, their opinions will stay the same. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	I have to wait another week for my district to decide on how schools will be in September. I’m so mentally wrecked and all of my teacher friends are too. It’s been near constant anxiety since March. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	I refuse to fret over the remaining mild strains of the China Virus after they have survived by not killing their hosts. #ChinaVirus #OpenSchools
20200731	1	I want to hear the ‘opinions’ of Principals, VP’s, teachers, support staff on the return to school in Ontario on a district by district basis. Not  @Sflecce . Safety of kids and public must come before money.   #COVID19 #Ontario #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	I wonder if a community based, parent-led approach to elementary schooling can work until the govt can properly prepare for kids’ return to class. Small groups, more play time, more independent learning, collaborative lesson plans. Some online, some in person. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	IF it is potentially too dangerous to vote in person, due to #COVID__19, then it is too dangerous for #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	If it's so dangerous to vote that we should suspend the election, according to orange blimp baby, why the actual f**k is it safe to open schools? That is more dangerous now than it was in March. #COVID19 #coronavirus #lockdownextension #SchoolsMustShutdown #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	In #Florida @GovRonDeSantis is closing 30+ covid testing sites during a huge spike in positive cases. Guess it's "what you don't know can't hurt you" leadership.  Florida needs new state government. #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	In a car, driving past a bunch of restaurant patios literally on the street because it’s too dangerous to eat inside, listening to how we’re sending kids back into packed classroooms. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	I’m not an anxious person, but as the new school year approaches, I am not sleeping through the night & I am trying to figure out how to quit teaching.  #ReopeningSchools
20200731	1	Jim Jordan is really attempting to push #Fauci to make a statement to support marshall law. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Just heard Danbury Local (northern Ohio) will only make masks mandatory in hallways, bathrooms, and on the bus.  A confined classroom is apparently ok #coronavirus #COVID #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Kim, try a little harder! Jr. might be mad!! #TrumpHatesScience #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Libraries were mentioned once in the "Guide to reopening Ontario's schools" - they could be used as a space for large classes.  Thankfully, library professionals have shown how adaptable we are & good library programming is more than just a room. #OntEdu #osla #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Lockdown was imposed india when there were only 100 cases and now when are having more than 15 lakh cases then we are heading towards reopening and conducting exams but we must realize that the peak is still around 2 months away #StudentsInSCForJustice #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	Love how @fordnation and @stephenlecce stood up pledging all this money to “safely reopen”  acting like they didn’t cut millions earlier this year. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	MLB, Large Budget, Adults, Mostly Outdoors, Tested Every Other Day  SCHOOLS, Decreased Budget, Kids, Mostly Indoors, No Plans for Regular Testing, 600 students per Bldg plus teachers and staff  MLB, One Team lasted 3 days  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	Make no mistake. I am not scared to teach my own child. Try me. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	My 17-year-old niece wants to go back to school but doesn't have the option to go back for the 1st semester. She said, "C'mon how can I learn art online?" #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	My friend called me while buying school supplies for his child & shared the supply list had ziplock bags. He and I rationalized every size. Then, he exasperatedly asked: how many do I buy? Result: he bought 1 box of every size available (just in case) #education #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	My perents don't me go to school when its raining and you think they'll let me go while millions of people have died already? Fuck no. Close them schools back up #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	None of that will mean a thing when - on day 1 - Billy and Johnny swap masks at lunch. #onpoli #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools
20200731	1	Nothing like witnessing a good late-night thunderstorm and lightning to wash some of this anxiety, frustration, anger and grief away. #teaching #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Nowhere in this list of Enhanced Safety Measures do we find "improving ventilation and air circulation" THE MOST IMPORTANT factor in COVID transmission is prolonged shared air-space.  @Sflecce @ONTSpecialNeeds #covidontario #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Observations from my soon-to-be 5th grader:  1) Most of my friends don't wash their hands after using the bathroom. 2) So if you're in a grade 3/4 split, only half the class wears masks? 3) Can I chew gum now?  4) Music class is going to suck.   #onted #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Opening schools is risking everyone. EVERYONE. Health comes first, you shouldn’t rush to reopen schools in September. There is no rush. Safety and health come first. #schoolreopening #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Our President @a_rosamilia  will be on @CNBC tomorrow between 2pm and 3pm discussing the reopening of schools. #OnlyWhenItsSafe #ReopeningSchools
20200731	1	Redfield is calling for schools to open face-to-face to provide social services to students. Teachers cannot be our society's only safety net. Opening schools in-person as the pandemic surges around us will disable or kill thousands of students and teachers. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Republicans always use the excuse it’s “too soon” to address school shootings following a schoolshooting.  Schools have been shut down for 4 months now.  What progress has been made during that time to make the schools safer?  #RepublicansDontCareAboutKids #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	SMH @Sflecce doesn’t have a plan. Him and his team don’t even consult teachers & parents. They’re not protecting our youngest at all. I am so angry with the proposed plan. He did fuck all since #COVID19 happened and just passed the buck #failure #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Seconded! Would love to hear an answer to this. Mine are entering SK and Gr. 2. @CBCNews @globalnewsto #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Seems like Kindergarten classrooms are going to remain at 29 +students, with that number social distancing will be impossible.  These are often the same classrooms that are used for daycare/extended day programs so at high risk for cross contamination #SickKids #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	So Redfield tells us we MUST follow 5 commandments to hold back virus, including staying out of crowded places. Right after, he explains why schools MUST reopen to “protect” children’s mental health.   OMG the irony. School’s. Are. Crowded. Places. #Covid_19 #schools
20200731	1	So it's safe enough to open schools and send folx back to work, but #COVID19 is too dangerous to have an election? ... If only there were way to vote without physically going to a polling location... #VoteByMail #ElectionFraud #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	So when the flu starts should we shut down schools too. More people die of that every year.#SchoolReopening
20200731	1	So, as a teacher and in my school, I am responsible for food, daycare, mental health, child abuse, and ... what am I missing? Right. Education. I am charged with educating our children. Listening to @SteveScaliseGOP talk you wouldn't know that #schools
20200731	1	So. Many. Questions.  #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Someone needs to tell #GymJordan the school is on fire & you can’t go in the school when it’s on fire.  Gym go away. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Student in Indiana gets sent to school by parents while waiting on COVID test results. Test turns out to be positive. Oh yes, self-monitoring is certainly going to be a successful means to open schools. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Teachers are the new front line workers #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	Thank you for the wonderful reminder of what we all can do!  #teachers #principals #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	That last question was my favorite.  #Trump #TrumpPressConference #WhiteHouse #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	The #MLB Miami Marlins contracted 18 positive #COVID19 infections from grown adults with a 67 page health and safety manual including nearly daily testing and safety protocols! How are we going to possibly keep our school kids safe? #COVID19Ontario #education #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	The reality that my daughter and wife’s school is about to open up to physical classes is terrifying. Why? #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	There is no fucking way I'd send my kids to school in Ontario in September. #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	We want schools to open AND for people to not die As a result.  The only one ‘wrong’ for mom’s is the dirt bag ‘grab her by the pussy’ president we’re all stuck with now because of people like you.  #NotMyKids #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	What is the @Sflecce @fordnation @PeelSchools plan to ensure air circulation and ventilation in every single classroom? #covidontario #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	What is the process for enrolling my children in the remote learning option @fordnation? How will Boards be held accountable for the quality of this? #SafeSeptember #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	What kind of nonsense is this, that young children have better immune so chances  r low but did he forget that these children live with adults who have higher chances to get sick. @regionofpeel @PeelSchools #Ontario #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	When our students are enough responsible and intelligent to prevent spread of corona virus but so called govt. Officials are not so intelligent to run PSU companies and railways in profit #PSUPrivatization #railwayprivatization #SchoolReopening
20200731	1	You CANNOT say in the same breath that ‘Yes, some children will get COVID’ and ‘We recognize the need for and have developed a plan that is *safe* for students, school staff, and families.’  Utter bullshit. #ReopeningSchools
20200731	1	You cite the “low” % of infections in kids BUT you fail (as usual because you aren’t truthful) to point out how opening schools WILL AFFECT teachers, staff, bus drivers, cafe workers, etc! Somebody wake this dodo bird up. Quick! He’s dangerous! #babytrump #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200731	1	You know this whole thing would have been believable if teachers hadn't asked for all the things on the liberals agenda. Welfare for all illegals, refund the police, global warming ECT...#SchoolReopening
20200731	1	You know what I love most? Watching old white men with no medical education bully Fauci and argue about how safe it is to open schools on Capitol Hill.  #gopfail #StayAtHome #SchoolReopening

20200801	1	And with this same sentiment, I find it hard for Lecce to make all these decisions when he never attended public school. He went to private school is whole life. So how is that fair? #onpoli #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	As much as hate schools not reopening, the good news is it will finally open our eyes to how little the districts actually care about you or your familiy. Something to remember when the they inevitably ask you to open your pocket book again.  #backtoschool #ReopeningSchools
20200801	1	CBSE Schools are conducting PA1 Online Exams??? Are they allowed to conduct Online Exams??? #CBSE #class12 #schools
20200801	1	Everyone knows reverse psychology works but yet noone seems to recognize when it's being used. Schools need to be opened up. Social Interaction is as important as food or water. It is cruel to deprive children of life because adults can't figure out how to get along. #OpenSchools
20200801	1	Exactly. Nothing will ever please them. #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Gavin Newsom is a tyrant . #OpenAmericaNow #OpenSchools

20200801	1	I agree with Jay Anthony on NBA getting test vs the public. This shows how companies are treated better than the fans of these sports. WHERE are they getting the test? Why are they not available as quickly for us? Arenas: we don't need them. #schools
20200801	1	I taught for a few decades, rarely did i find hot water, soap, and paper towels - in the teacher restrooms. In the students restrooms probably less often.#schools
20200801	1	Indoor gatherings of 20 kids for 6 hours a day might not be good then... #ReopeningSchools
20200801	1	Just shared the @WFPSchools reopen plan with my 6th grader. He is SO disappointed. There is no substitute for time with friends. #parenting #lifeinlockdown #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Kids are said to be hospitalized in Texas/Florida & other states for this virus. They said they this is rare. In Texas doctors are worried. An entire camp of kids was infected w/ all precautions in place. I feel this shit has already mutated.  #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Let’s lock DeVos in a room with 25 potential COVID carriers for 8 hours with or without masks. Pack her a sack lunch of PB&J with a warm carton of milk chaser for 5 days. Then wait 14 days... then maybe we can have dialogue on opening schools. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200801	1	Masks are being made mandatory in  several indoor places (after a pathetically long delay) yet students will soon be COMPULSED to spend 6 hours with 1000 other students every day in a tight and enclosed space and NOT wear a mask? Time to sue the Government! #shielding #schools
20200801	1	Nice of our school district to release reopening info to the whole district before informing the staff. Not even an email.  #teacherlife #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	No wonder they don't want schools to reopen in August - they're too busy trying to destroy America!  #OpenSchoolsNow #OpenSchools

20200801	1	Our children will now have OCD for the rest of their lives?!?! #coronavirus #WearADamnMask #childrensafety #schools
20200801	1	Part of evidence it’s safe with YA in school: “In Scotland, 152 (0.8%) of a total 18,452 positive cases of COVID-19 were among people aged under 15”  How many were tested? Only those with symptoms are tested & YA dont tend not to show them. Wheres the scrutiny? #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Physical and psychological safety for staff, families and students will be paramount for a successful return to school.  #WeAreInThisTogether #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Please stop comparing teachers to doctors! There are teachers all over this country who are right now making masks for their kids out of coffee filters they bought with their own money at the Walmart where they work in the summer. #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Since when do these ignorant red necks care so much about education? #COVIDIOTS #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
20200801	1	Soo I just realized that when we go back to school people will literally die of #COVID19. Like #wtf am I supposed to do when my class mates don’t show up again? Keep writing my 5 Paragraph essay? #schoolsreopening #publicschools #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200801	1	There will be another 20K coronavirus deaths in the next 3 weeks. Now is NOT the time to force children to attend brick-and-mortar schools. That is NOT "keep[ing] American families safe". #GOPDeathCult #GOPBetrayedAmerica #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200801	1	With #COVID19 rising in the north & #manchesterlockdown education must have a clear plan B for online learning. We can't get caught short with 2 days notice again. #schools

20200802	1	"Liability restriction waiver" with the wording "deathly illness obtained or transmitted on campus" shouldn't be a part of a campus opening strategy. Am I wrong here? #AcademicTwitter #ReopeningSchools
20200802	1	#Capitalism brought us dependence on a 2-income household.  With the #pandemic they need one parent to stay home with the kids. #SafeSeptember #SchoolReopening
20200802	1	.@StLucieGOV. .@1SLPS #Isaias  St Lucie County will: -NOT issue Emergency Declaration -NOT issue curfew -NOT open shelters -NOT issue curfew -NOT issue evacuations  WHY? B/C COVID19  But OPEN SCHOOLS UP?? #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200802	1	20 to 30 of these a day and we need to process the paperwork and make the determination that yes these children are high risk, fill it out and then leave it for the physicians to sign, on top of all the other paperwork they have to sign. We do tell them #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200802	1	@DanCrenshawTX Minimum wage essential workers need your help! If schools won't open, parents need to be reimbursed for private tutors, private learning groups, or private school in Texas Otherwise, why work? Not to mention the social-emotional health of young kids #OpenSchools
20200802	1	@RheaBoydMD’s advice to teachers re: strategies to reduce classroom stress when they welcome children back to (virtual/in person) schools after a summer where they witnessed effects of racism on those who surround them:   “Actively love them”  #blm #scaap2020 #SchoolReopening
20200802	1	And that the parent or relative should have the option to televise or teleteach something like that to the classroom because they could could become infected and pass it on to the child/ren in the household. No big deal, we understand but we're getting #COVID19 #SchoolReopening

20200802	1	Example:   Student has a cough/fever on September 10th. Student gets tested. Test results come back positive on September 24th.   So how many of us were infected for the duration of the two weeks wait?  #SchoolReopening
20200802	1	Hey America, since it’s gonna be really hard to reopen schools in a normal fashion this year, maybe we can look at revamping the typical school format that is antiquated and outdated. Can’t think of a better time than now. Just a thought. #SchoolReopening

20200802	1	Let me help you understand. I did not sign up to watch people die. I noped out of the medical profession because I realized (with the help of my pediatrician who knew me from 8-18 and pointed out this flaw in my plan) that I could not watch people die. 1/ #ReopeningSchools
20200802	1	More and more professional athletes and team personnel are testing positive for Covid. If professional sports is incapable of avoiding exposure and illness, how can anyone think we will be able to open schools. #schoolsreopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200802	1	Most kids will have been off school for 24 weeks in September. That's a long time in a kid's life. It will have caused mental damage to some kids and this will not be shown immediately. They must open to bring some "normality" and "stability" back to their lives.#ReopeningSchools
20200802	1	Nasty teachers who don’t care about children coming out of the woodwork. Expose them. Fire them.   Are these greedy, selfish people the ones who should care for — & even worse, — “teach” your precious child each day?   #SchoolCultureMatters #SchoolReopening
20200802	1	Of course many will come back positive!!  How many deaths?  #COVID19 #Scaretactic #OpenSchools
20200802	1	Parents can call Districts & tell them they will withdraw from the District. That $ gets their attention  The virus will shut it down anyway. It's just a matter of how many thousands will die due to #ReopeningSchools

20200802	1	So we're being inundated with paperwork at the office from parents or relatives of many children that we see at the office that currently work at many school districts stating that the child/ren are high risk (i.e. asthma, cardio condition, lungs etc.) #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200802	1	Some of these medical forms schools require are a bit asinine under the pandemic clock. Some of us don’t want our kids exposed at provider offices. Well visits can wait a few months. #SchoolReopening

20200803	1	An opinion piece in The NY Times basically said its cool if 5 percent of teachers get sick and die, as long as parents don’t have to deal with their kids at home during the school year.   #coronavirus #Covid_19 #SchoolReopening
20200803	1	Any one else pissed off that one of the standard lines for making our children return to schools is... "The mortality rate among children is low" #WTF !!  Whose child is to be one of the sacrificial stats ? Safety of our children should be our 1st priority ! #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200803	1	Are the schools going to disinfect the desks, bathrooms etc everytime a child uses one? Answer hell to the no, keep your child home. They also aren't going to disinfect the busses after every use. #Covid_19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200803	1	Asymptomatic kids are going to spread Covid like wildfire, infecting their parents and grandparents, leading to a massive spike in deaths.  This is the stuff of dystopian novels.   How many orphans will the Republicans create this fall?  #TrumpVirus #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200803	1	Can’t eat in a restaurant or go to a Broadway show but let’s go back to school.   I agree with all the rules and restrictions in place but we need to be perfecting online learning instead of wasting time on reopening plans #Covid_19 #coronavirus #ReopeningSchools
20200803	1	Congress makes the laws.  Have them fund an online format for those that are scared and open up schools again.  Teachers who are at risk can retire, or find a non-essential job.  It’s not that hard to creat a bifurcated solution.  #OpenSchools
20200803	1	Death will be the result of the experiment of opening schools. Despite the evidence against the decision. The data is telling us its not safe. Kids will not die from another 6-months of online instruction. Teachers and staff are at risk & that is not Ok. #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200803	1	Parents being forced to sign agreements to make them liable for their child's online home assignments. Sounds like Special Education. Every parent is now under the thumb of a school authority that is forcing parents to DO, what the schools will not do.  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200803	1	Realize that the more this becomes obvious the fewer middle and middle+ students will return, and if they don't, public education ends on the Detroit-Betsy DeVos path. #ReopeningSchools
20200803	1	Schools ARE said to be safe because the LEAST DISCIPLINED members of society are expected to act MORE DISCIPLINED than their parents. #COVID19 #schoolsreopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200803	1	The only way schools will stay open is if contact tracing is ignored. If 1 teacher tests positive for coronavirus half the students are quarantined for possible exposure and 2/3rds of teachers interacting with the 1 teacher would also be quarantined. #Vaccine #SchoolReopening
20200803	1	The school board in my district keeps talking about returning to brick and mortar schools, but the reality is that we would be returning to Brick and Asbestos schools. #COVID19 #ReopeningSchools

20200803	1	This is pure insanity. What are we trying to prove by opening schools right when the outbreaks are pretty much everywhere? Is this worth the lives of our children & teachers? I go back in 2 weeks. Our Super is stubborn. He thinks he’s asserting strength. #SchoolReopening
20200803	1	This week virtual school starts for my kids. After being home with kids for 8 years I was finally going to start focusing on my passions and goals  I’m trying to embrace my new reality of homeschooling for the next year. #ItsOkayNotTobeOkay #schools
20200803	1	What makes people think that children are somehow immune to a virus that adults are not immune to? That seems like uninformed thinking. #BetsyDeVos is totally unsuited to be US Sec of ED, and pretty unsuited to be a human being.  She cares nothing for children.  #SchoolReopening

20200803	1	Yes cases r going up bcoz of more testing but with schools opening don't u think we r making the future generation more prone to #Covid_19 then cases will go further up Also remember the people who r recovering from #coronavirus r showing symptoms of other health issues #schools

20200804	1	If you think teachers should suck it up and one of your arguments is that some kids are abused at home, I swear to god you better have adopted kids from abusive homes or be volunteering somewhere now, bc we all know you didn’t care about those kids before. #ReopeningSchools

20200804	1	Inadequate testing and tracing, unrealistic expectations of school cleanliness and student hygiene, and ultimately impractical solutions for things like transportation, lunch and sudden outbreaks are why SCHOOLS SHOULD BE DISTANCE LEARNING UNTIL JANUARY. #SchoolReopening

20200804	1	It’s weird as a teacher to think that I only need to survive just long enough for them to close the school, once #COVID19 starts to run rampant through the student population. I’m sure there is a metaphor out there somewhere for the way I feel.   #SchoolReopening

20200804	1	Thanks for taking one for the team @SimonClarkeMP - you sounded plausible though obviously you were perpetrating lies and truth twisting #SchoolReopening
20200804	1	The only answer that makes sense-Schools should do the best they can online until there’s a vaccine-Kids shouldn’t be used as experiments-First 2 close because of the threat-so they should be the last 2 open when the threat is controlled-what happened 2 R priorities #OpenSchools
20200804	1	Then shift ur focus on promoting opening schools!! #OpenSchools
20200804	1	There needs to be a Nationwide walk-out of teachers and staff over the forced, insane,dangerous reopening of schools.    Students need to stay home!  Who agrees?  Retweet if you do please!  #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200805	1	I know. I am so discouraged. I think the school I work for is going to fall in line w surrounding schools and do 'distance learning.' Why dont we see educating as essential? We will see the effects of this for generations. #backtoschool #OpenSchools
20200805	1	I went and saw former students at sixth grade transition day. Can I just say that these kids were killing it with their masks and hand sanitizing?! While I know it’s “mandatory,” these kids took it very seriously. So proud of my GenZers. #SchoolReopening
20200805	1	I'm a huge supporter of public schools, but my kids are staying home. I have the ability to keep them home and as such a responsibility to do so: for my kids, for your kids, and for school staff. Told the school, got laughed at, because I'm a liberal in Alabama. #SchoolReopening

20200805	1	It’d be a safe bet that Asa Hutchinson’s & Johnny Key’s obdurate insistence on in-person school this fall is ultimately about money. Somebodies they’re beholden to make more money when kids are on campuses than when they aren’t. #oneLRSD #ReopeningSchools
20200805	1	Learning benchmarks presume continuity of instruction. Let’s dispel the notion that kids “should be” somewhere on a learning path at any given time. Let’s instead look at Ss strengths and for their growth. #thekidswillbeok #elemed #COVID19 #SchoolReopening

20200814	1	(4/4)  So now this FB post is even scarier because it sounds like it COULD happen.   Yes, it might be an extreme situation, but the fact it is legally allowed should ring alarm bells for parents, no?  Hope I'm reading this wrong, if I am please correct me  #SchoolReopening
20200814	1	1.  So the teachers empathised with students and gave them all high grades.   But the commission marked them down again, for the standards must be maintained.  You see the universities space is limited, they simply cannot scale.   #torychaos #ExamResults #disruption #schools
20200814	1	@FOX2News  you guys are becoming terrible. Opening schools putting children, staff and families at risk is irresponsible. We must use technology to provide a safe conductive environment for learning.   #SchoolReopening
20200814	1	A group of parents needs to get together and sue their public school for educational malpractice if schools don't fully open. That is the only way this madness will stop  #REOPENSCHOOLS #schoolsreopening #ReopeningSchools

20200814	1	Dear U.S Schools, If you can enforce a dress code on young women to ensure they don’t DISTRACT MALE STUDENTS. Then you can mandate that all students must wear a mask for public health during a PANDEMIC!   #WearADamnMask #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200814	1	Excellent question.  Why don’t you reduce the number of kids per class from the onset? Why beat around and offer more money to rent more space, etc.   #onpoli #SchoolReopening
20200814	1	Finally our school district released their plan for 2020/2021 school year today. They're reopening but there's option for distant learning. I still think schools should stay closed until a safe/effective tx is avail especially with flu season coming. #SchoolReopening

20200816	1	For schools to open teachers will have to be extremely strict enforcing masks & social distancing. This isn’t a game or a test. Every child is a potential spreader of a deadly virus. Our nation is now depending on teachers to save lives because our leaders won’t #SchoolReopening

20200817	1	Two kids self-isolatibg awaiting test results. Another child sent home with a temperature. School still open, still no masks or distancing.  #JohnSwinneySentMeInToDie #scottishschools #SchoolReopening
20200817	1	We'll see. @WhiteHouse I think you're right about the in-person being the best for most kids, but with #coronavirus I think you're wearing rose colred glasses and ignoring the science. #schools
20200817	1	we’re an hour into virtual school and i already hate this shit so much #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	"Anyone who wants a #test, can get a test"... Why aren't we testing all #students and faculty, before they go back into the #classrooms? Hundreds already quarantined in the first couple of weeks. #NoPlan #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	#China universities are reopen for Fall and Chinese students are not happy: “Keeping everyone on campus is completely unnecessary, especially if the rule doesn’t apply to university staff & on-campus vendors. Does the virus only infect college students?” #COVID19 #SchoolReopening

20200818	1	99.9%+ will recover. #ReopeningSchools
20200818	1	@Jdbfitzgerald @damienbrowne Not a silver bullet solution but ensuring better cleaning solution delivered. US schools are looking at combos of UV within HVAC and solutions like ours for surface disinfection ( bathrooms/classrooms/offices etc). #ReopeningSchools
20200818	1	@Sflecce you seriously have no clue what our concerns as parents are because you’re not a parent. If you were, you would never be ok sending your child into school with the plan your government has formulated. This is a disaster waiting to happen. #SafeSeptember #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	@quezada1229 gotta quit running down the clock in every one of these "town halls". Let other people speak! Also, the optics of y'all sitting at computers to have a meeting but wanting to put 15 kids per poorly ventilated room is insane. PHASE IT IN!#yonkers #corruption #schools
20200818	1	Better yet...maybe we should just close schools forever so Dr. Welsh can focus full time on his emerging newspaper clickbait propaganda career. #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	Can a similar U turn regarding schools opening without adequate safety measures be achieved? Private Schools are not opening I don't think? It is a similar divisive application of injustice based on class. #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	Exactly! You are protesting to postpone the exam & the other group of students are protesting to conduct the exam. Eventually, all are from the same education system. Let’s respect each other’s opinion & let govt take the right decision. #reopencollege #ReopeningSchools
20200818	1	First #Scotland government makes a screeching #UTurn on #ALevelsResults then England follows suit.  Yet again @ScotGovFM @theSNP shows why she is way ahead of the game when it comes to making big policy decisions.  #ALevelProtests #education #schools
20200818	1	Florida Covid cases went from 9k a day to under 3k a day in a week? Who believes this? Schools are opening so @GovRonDeSantis needs low numbers. #floridacovid #desantisliesfloridiansdie #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	For all you celebrities saying "open our schools", can you come tell Arizona teachers this? Because they were opening today a over 100 teachers refused to show up. #schoolsreopening #RedForEd #OpenSchools

20200818	1	Hello @KNUTKenya is it easier to manage kids outside schools or in schools. #COVID19 is everywhere, the threat of spread doesn't make sense. #OpenSchools
20200818	1	How did any school anywhere think it would okay to bring kids on campus??? Beyond dangerous and short-sighted. So sick of the fuckos in this country. #SchoolReopening

20200818	1	That Falz thread caught me off guard. To think he was going the direction of advocating for the opening of schools. Last last everybody is after their own stomach. #OpenSchools
20200818	1	The PC government has shown ZERO leadership when it comes to the safe return to school for our kids. They are an absolute disappointment. @Sflecce @fordnation @samoosterhoff #DoBetter #COVID19Ontario #SchoolReopening

20200818	1	This is awesome! I’m wondering if anyone else experienced the tech-literacy gap this past Spring?  I noticed that I need to balance teaching content with teaching technology... it becomes draining to be virtually “hip”.   #edchat #ReopeningSchools
20200818	1	Virtual school: scheduling feels like a job. When do I get paid? #SchoolReopening
20200818	1	Well, any rational minded person in the country said this was exactly what was going to happen. Sadly the schools listened to politicians instead of science and common sense.#StayHome #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200818	1	Yeah please reopen schools and colleges atleast in phased manner. We aren't able to learn much from online classes. They are utterly bad. And also think about those guys who don't have access to smartphones or laptops and even network issues in villages. #Reopencolleges #schools
20200818	1	Yup. #Cops are in danger, literally and figuratively, while teachers are at home every day, knowing their pay is going up and they're in zero danger of being defunded. #UpsideDownWorld #schools
20200818	1	how are we developing caretakers?  are we leveraging the expertise of caretakers who already home-school?  what viable advice can we learn from them when attempting to support learning through Zoom? what does their “school-day” entail?  #ReopeningSchools

20200819	1	Listening to back to school plans, my take: we need to shut the country down, pay those who can’t work from home a living wage, get this under control and then slowly open back up. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
20200819	1	MPLS Schools starts the yr with distance learning. A smart and yes tough move. Not only for health of our kids but our teachers also. We gripe about alot but Teachers are still the lowest paid and with the highest demands put on them. #ReopeningSchools
20200819	1	My school building is only 10 years old. We can barely get a breeze going during a June heatwave with all doors and windows open. Our windows don't open past 4 inches for Health & Safety reasons, ironically. Ventilation, give me strength #edchatie #ReopeningSchools

20200819	1	People clamoring for public schools to open often list “simple” things to do for safety, and I keep seeing “upgrade ventilation system” on that easy-peasy list. Do these people ever look at school budgets and see extra $ for a hugely expensive facilities upgrade? #schools

20200820	1	Great news in #DFW area. Some #school districts (not administered by hand-wringers) are opening “normally”. Kids ride bus/bikes to school, teachers+kids in classrooms. This is very encouraging. Of course, in all districts remote learning is always available. #ReopeningSchools
