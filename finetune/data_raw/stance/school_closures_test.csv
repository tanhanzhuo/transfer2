20200311	1	Schools close for an inch of snow or when flu season keeps a lot of students at home sick, but they want to remain open until a confirmed COVID-19 case pops up in the building? It looks like the schools need to be educated. #CloseTheSchools

20200708	0	They are using schools as a political gain on their part. They think if schools don’t open it will be “Trump’s fault” therefore blowing the election in their favor. They don’t want to see the economy open either. #OpenSchools
20200708	0	This shouldn't be a partisan issue...time to put our kids future first...The flu is far more dangerous to our children than COVID, studies have shown they are minimal spreaders of the virus and the rest of Europe has opened schools with no problems. #flattenthefear #OpenSchools

20200715	1	I doubt that communities know that they have the power to close schools. we shouldn't wait for the government to announce  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	I wonder if @realDonaldTrump, @BetsyDeVosED and @IngrahamAngle would change their minds about the dangers of schools fully opening if they were the ones walking the halls of the schools & sitting in the song circles at daycares  #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Insults were hurled at @MmusiMaimane and we were cyber-bullied for supporting the call for schools not to reopen under unsafe conditions. Y'all are a confused bunch. Honestly. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Kenyan Education Minister recently announced that schools in kenya will remain closed until 2021. And yet in SA we have people like #angiemotshekga who think SA schoolkids are exempted from succumbing to the virus.  #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	People will surprise you. They want schools to be shut, the power is in your hands, don't send your kids to school, why do we want to be told that schools are shut before doing so. if everyone doesn't send their kids to school there wont be a school. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	There are so many cases coming from schools and lots of other people are getting infected do they want us to die school must shutdown now school must shutdown or we are all going to die #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200717	1	@BetsyDeVosED you are crazy if you think the NBA and all it’s resources in a bubble aren’t able to keep Covid out, but the extremely underfunded schools are going to be able to.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	@PressSec  1. Read real science. 2. & other countries can reopen schools because THEY did the hard work: shutdowns, masks, tests, tracing & isolating. We didn't. 3. Look at Israel. They are closing up schools now.  Children over Trump's campaign, please.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Do you want to trust the people who cage babies with your children in schools? They. Just. Do. Not. Care. About anyone but their rich friends, who don’t attend public schools. ##NotMyPresident #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Don't forget the ever popular "we are the outlier here!"  No shit Sherlock, the countries who have reopened schools didn't totally fuck up their response to this virus. We all need to tell #TrumpTheTwitterTwerp #notmykid #NotMyChild
20200717	1	For those so “pro-life” you want me to sacrifice my children and myself (teacher) for “normalcy”. Funny how the D’s are accused of making masks political, while Trump & ilk sacrificed 100k Americans & are now coming for the children to win an election/raise economy! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I'm privileged to stay home & still work, allowing my kids to stay safe. Most people aren't that lucky. We need schools CLOSED and RELIEF for workers who can't stay home with kids. The economy returns with MANDATED MASKS & a flattened curve, not the other way around. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	It is a true travesty that we cannot rely on our government for accurate information during a pandemic. How are people suppose to make educated decisions?  Trump is creating even more angry mothers & fathers #notmykid #BlueWave #HeroesAct #COVID19 #TrumpFailedAmerica #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Knowing what I know from working on the COVID-19 response, I would not send my children to school (if I had any) in the situation Trump is demanding under our current pandemic situation. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	No Vaccine - No school, that has always been the policy, correct?? This is a deadly pandemic, not a reality show!!  I have already told our school district that my children will not be returning to the classroom!! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Not the science is in the way to reopen: the virus is! Very little evidence & data because kids are not tested that much! They get infected or are asymptomatic carriers. In EU: small groups, alternated classes, masks & washing hands, not before September 1. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Our three kids are not returning to the physical school until there is a vaccine.  The world needs to adjust, instead of trying to do business as usual. We are following science, not an agenda.  #TrumpVirus #NotMyChild

20200717	1	Remote learning is not perfect, but it can improve enormously with more focus on fewer subjects at a time.   Children CAN die of Covid-19, as can teachers, all school staff, and family members.   Covid-19 leaves longterm damage we are just learning about.   #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Reopening schools is the height of insanity. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Say a student contract Covid19, will the entire school shut down and quarantine for 14 days? Will teachers have to notify their children's school because their children are students in a different district. Will their child school have to close? This will be a mess.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The acceptable amount of school aged child deaths from covid-19 is zero. None, not a single one.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	This is really unfair to school's giving them less than 2 weeks before being forced to reopen early in most state's. Funds have yet to be received to help with additional costs of changes. #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	To anyone that thinks schools should open in regions with outbreaks, I invite you to become a teacher and put your money where your mouth is. There will be plenty of openings in the next two months. You're only sharing a classroom with 40 to 300 people per day.#NotMyChild
20200717	1	Vaccine first.  #notmykid #NotMyChild
20200717	1	We ALL want schools to open, but we want it done when it’s safe. It isn’t safe now. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	We can open the schools when we beat the virus- actually do the required close downs and impose 14 days no new cases... the longer we put this off the worse the economic collapse! Ridiculous! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	You think someone actually wrote that line for her?  What a stupid thing to say.  But I guess Pence started it with CDC guidelines 'won't be the reason we won't open schools.'  #NotMyChild

20200717	2	Thanks Facebook for allowing groups to spread anti-science and anti-vax information on their platform. Bottom line is that vaccines work. Don't like your kids vaccinations it? That's your right but don't expect others to make exceptions for your selfishness.  #NotMyChild

20200718	1	Any district that opens up in August for F2F better not ever use the term “data driven” ever again to describe their academic mission statement if they choose to ignore the overwhelming amount of data telling us to stay home. #SchoolReopening #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200718	1	Can things get dumber in NYC? Mayor De blasio says Child care will be provided for up to 80,000 kids when schools closed this Fall. Where will this take place you ask??? In the schools. You just can’t dream this crap up LOL.   #NYC #OpenSchools
