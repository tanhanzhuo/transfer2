20200306	1	Dear #lausd If I keep my kid home from middle school to keep her safe from #coronavirus #COVID19 it SHOULD NOT count against her as an absence. Please alert families that this’ll be allowed. NOW IS THE TIME TO SAVE LIVES, not when the virus shows up in school #CloseTheSchools
20200306	1	Ive been angry about the way @KCPubHealth & @CDCgov handling schools #COVID19seattle HUGE burden placed on kidsw/medically vulnerable family or are medically vulnerable themselves. Miss school OR risk infecting those they love. @GovInslee @WADeptHealth #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools

20200311	1	2. We aren't thinking of safety.  This is a direct email from my kid's middle school,  my kid has asthma, is not allowed to take precautions, and will receive no aid if (when ) your child comes into contact with a #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools
20200311	1	@NYCSchools won’t close because parents can’t afford to lose working hours or will struggle to find childcare and some students eat their main meals at school. The system is broken and ultimately there may be some serious consequences down the road. #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools

20200311	1	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT #CloseTheSchools
20200311	1	Coronavirus has shut down all private universities across NYC, but all CUNY schools are still open. This is wildly irresponsible considering CUNY students are lower income, & more likely to not have insurance. This is what a war on the poor looks like. #CloseTheSchools

20200311	1	I don't care that I have to go to school, I just prefer not to catch a disease that, even though because I'm a child and the survival rate with #COVID19 with children is high, could be brought home to my house and kill my parents. I know it's unlikely, but still. #CloseTheSchools
20200311	1	I don’t care about the coronavirus I just want to get out of this my dumbass school lmao #CloseTheSchools
20200311	1	I don’t get why they are waiting for coronavirus to get to schools before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the schools so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it #CloseTheSchools

20200311	1	waiting until we have the first case of Covid-19 in the @NYCSchools is the height of stupidity! @NYCMayor should close the schools now, before anyone tests positive and spreads it through their school and on the buses/subways.  #CoronavirusOutbreak #CloseTheSchools

20200314	1	@MercerYou I could not be more disappointed. As a public health professional taking night classes your decision to remain open in a serious pandemic puts me and everyone else at great risk. You should be ashamed!! #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #PublicHealth #CloseTheSchools

20200715	1	#schoolsmustshutdown You just closed/banned alcohol,the reason was/is you are protecting us from Covid 19 because it's extremely increasing everyday yet since schools re-opened teacher's and learner's have added to the  increasingly number #pleaseprotectus #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200715	1	As a teacher i really dont like the fact that parliament is closed and we are expected to go to school and  be exposed to dangers of covid-19 everyday. This is like sending your chicken to the dogs, while u watch the show and relax #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Every school district should be asking their governors and the mayors and their school boards to give them the facts not opinions on opening the schools did the children. The facts do not back up the hysteria. Children will suffer..#OpenSchools

20200715	1	I can tell u for free, @MYANC have so many tenders linked to schools, closing schools will mean closing thier Pockets, They rather see teachers and children with chronic illness dying of Covid-19 than losing thier bite on the 500 billion relief package.  #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200715	1	Option of homeschooling is for the rich. Not for the poor. You gave Us no choice. Then you say if they don’t go to school there wont be be space for them next year . What choice or options are there? #COVID19 #angie #LockdownSA #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Our future is in the hands of our children, is not like am saying this because I left school with grade 7 but schools must be closed. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Our teachers aren't covid bouncers. These must happen: 1. Getting real PPEs' used by front line staff in hospitals not just the sanitizers and only two masks. What nonsense is that. 2. DBE should insure that classrooms have correct ventilation   #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Parents have the power, by simply pulling all your kids out of school, all schools will shut down!   #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Schools should just be closed,the 2020 curriculum will continue once the vaccine is found,even if it means 2020 curriculum get done in 2021-2022,we’ll have to adjust & catch-up at some point.   #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Schools won't shut down because the government is if certain the problem is with alcohol and cigarettes #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Shut down schools and continuepaying teachers . You pay people for making children so why not somebody who did not choose to put their life on hold ? #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	The colder it becomes the higher the level of Covid-19 cases rise...our children aren’t coping at all. Although the curriculum has to be covered mara not like this,come on now! Most of the learners are in hospitals right now, so what’s the use grand sharp?#SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	This is tiring, those parents who says kids are safe at schools should just bring them once, and hope their funeral covers and policies are up to date...mine will be at home!!! #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	We not saying schools should close forever nah,they should at least take a break to recover until the 2nd week of August.The aim is for the harsh winter conditions to pass then things can get back to normal.We will try by all means that our children comply. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	Well, that says it all! #StayAtHome #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200715	1	When I read this I can’t help but conclude that opening schools is the worst possible thing we could do. #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200716	0	So true. Your teachers need to focus on what they need to do to get ready for the fall semester. Teachers are planning right now. Let them know what the expectation will be. Online learning is a temporary situation. #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200716	1	America is so used to children being gunned down while AT SCHOOL that it seems very easy for them to ready for #COVID19 deaths that are coming for the teachers/students/their families as American schools are being FORCED to reopen for in person education!#SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	And what exactly are you doing to make schools any safer, Senator?  Teachers and students need PPEs and testing.  Most school don’t have nurses or even money for sanitizers and tissues. You want all kids going back to school without safeguards?  #NotMyChild
20200716	1	Close schools , put teachers on unpaid leave and let them apply for TERS like private school teachers #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	Dear President @CyrilRamaphosa, I'm a teacher who has tested positive for  COVID-19. Please shut down schools to protect our children. Economies can be revived, not lives #COVID19 #PresidentialImbizo #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	I am sick to my stomach over the thought that there are districts informing #teachers to update their wills and having both children and teachers sign waivers over dying. We are not at a point of safety to open schools properly. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	Schools must shutdown I'm not sending my child to school #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200716	1	Social distancing is just a beautiful theory, learners when you turn your back they don’t practice it nor wear masks. Even teaching is not conducive, how do you avoid touching learners scripts?. Even marking class tests? #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200716	1	“A major teachers union in Los Angeles says the district can’t re-open schools until there is a ‘moratorium’ on charter schools."   With good reason. Charter schools do not protect teachers, refuse troubled students, drain money and talent from our school system. #SaveOurSchools

20200717	0	I'm thinking that if kids going into college thing that 15% of $8,000 is about $300.00 that we really need school choice and to open up schools now.  #SchoolChoice #OpenSchools

20200717	1	*whispers* The @GOP isn't trying to win @realDonaldTrump votes by sending your kids back to school with no #COVID19 plan, they're trying to destroy public education by bankrupting and breaking the system by sending it into total chaos when half or more don't show up #NotMyChild
20200717	1	@CDCgov  no longer gets data. It goes to the White House. Great. The country we relied on to keep us safe and that said the virus is a hoax. Now has contol over the numbers we see. And he wants schools open #NotMyChild

20200717	1	@dougducey It is unsafe to open schools in 4 weeks.   We can almost guarantee you will not follow the science but follow Trump down the rabbit hole again.  This time you can take that trip alone.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	@drcarachrist you commented that kids are not spreaders and less susceptible but many countries have had to close schools because of spread.  You need to research more before speaking. #NotMyChild

20200717	1	All countries in the western world opening schools but let's see..we don't follow the science to open schools but we followed science to shut down..oh ok now that makes sense. #OpenSchools
20200717	1	But now it’s ok to send them to school meanwhile #coronavirus it’s still infecting anyone  There’s no cure No vaccine No treatment   & something like #WearAMaskSaveALife is a fighting issue  Parents Listen to Science Facts Medical Experts  Your children depend on you  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	COVID cases down to next to nothing Safe vaccine Effect treatment for those who get it  Then and only then can we talk. Until then #notmykid #NotMyChild

20200717	1	Dear Trump, DeVos and all #MAGA pushing to reopen schools before it is safe,  If are Federal government had taken this pandemic seriously and acted accordingly it would be safe to reopen schools this fall. But they didn't, so it's not.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Definitely keeping my kids home until there is a tested, wide spread vaccine. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Don’t reopen schools in the fall. Protect your children from a failed government and the deluded sycophants that continue to support it. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Either you win by dismantling the corrupt school system, or you win when the science is all of a sudden on your side and its ok to open schools. What do you think sir?  #homeschool #OpenSchools
20200717	1	Even though my 4 kids are adults, our oldest is a teacher. There is absolutely no guidance in place now. Schools open in less than a month. I worry about her and her students. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Friendly reminder that reopening schools is essentially biological warfare against BIPOC children. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	From my understanding, they are happy to sacrifice OUR children because many of these people don’t have their children in public schools. If they did, they might be more sympathetic, though on second thoughts, probably not. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Hey @RepValDemings what are you doing to help central Florida teachers in @OrangeCoFL to stay safe this school year? @JerryDemings doesn’t seem to want to take responsibility for closing the county and keeping kids and teachers safe.  #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	How about instead of endangering children, you give some money to education and fix our schools' horrible technology infrastructure so they can do the same things from home.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I challenge @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @BetsyDeVosED  to attend schools 5 days a week, 7 hrs a day when schools reopen. Come on in, sit in a desk, use the kids' restrooms, navigate the crowded halls, ride the bus, sit in the cafeteria if it's so safe. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I don’t even HAVE a child, and I understand that is imperative we keep schools closed until it is safe for students, teachera and staff. This shouldn’t be hard to grasp. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I pray that SCDHEC stays transparent. I heard today that our incompetent governor is directing SCDHEC to change the way they report their numbers. to not give people enough information, so McMaster can do Trump’s bidding in opening our schools without restrictions.#NotMyChild

20200717	1	If #NYCSchools reopen before #COVID19 is under control, then assuming the .1% fatality rate is correct for children, ages 4-18, then the death rate of students in #NYC will be 1,127 (rounded) based on current enrollment.  #Coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	If I'm wrong about schools reopening, all that happens is my son does distance learning for another semester or two. If DeVos is wrong, people die. I'll say it again. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	If Malls are not opening because of concerns with recirculated air #Ventilation HVAC systems spreading Coronavirus. Schools with sealed windows, interior classrooms, & the same recirculated air ventilation that fans #Coronavirus around shouldn't open.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	It's not only about children. It's also about what they are going to bring home. It's also about adults, parents, esp. grandparents and so on. Look at Israel. They opened the schools and next thing was an explosion of cases among children AND adults. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	I’m homeschooling this year. Not risking my daughter over someone who doesn’t understand wind and thinks the enemy is a friend.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Kayleigh McEnany said "the science shouldn't stand in the way" of schools opening.  During a pandemic the only thing we should listen to is SCIENCE! My children are not political pawns #NotMyChildren #NotMyChild

20200717	1	No vaccine, no school!  Kids are required to show vaccine records to set foot on any public school campus. Now we are letting that slide so they can pass around COVID and risk dying?   #NotMyChild
20200717	1	No, its a really simple visual demonstrating that our children and families are at risks. None of the people advocating for schools opening have children who will be impacted by this. Trump, DeVos, Pence... #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Obviously opening schools as usual all across the country is insane and dangerous. However, if you are screaming about closing schools without demanding a solution for parents suddenly without childcare then you do not actually care about parents or children  #NotMyChild

20200717	1	Riddle me this...the government has been so hell bent on vaccinations not allowing kids to attend school until they’re updated..we don’t even have a fucking vaccine for COVID so why does this moron and his negligent administration want to reopen schools?? #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Schools won't be safe until the virus is under control. You are a ghoul. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Science is NOT on the side of reopening brick and mortar schools!! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Science is based on FACTS  Not Figures Not Corporations  Not Political Agendas  And not for negligent, corrupt criminals who want to jumpstart economy to work their campaigns.  Schools should be closed until there is a vaccine.  This is Our Children  Not Products.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Send your kids to public schools first.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Show us the science that children and staff are not in harm's way if schools open.< All of it, as I know you hate cherry picked data.>   Cases are skyrocketing. Schools are *not* daycares. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So I guess trumpedo administration is abolishing science in schools. Cuz what it’s the point to teach children science if adults (not all of them but the stupid ones) don’t believe in it. Anyway my daughter is NOT going to face to face school this fall. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So glad Dekalb County schools doing virtual cause going back to school during this mess!?! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So, Republicans want to move their stupid convention outdoors, but kids should go sit in schools?  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	So. What are we MISSING while Donald & betsy promote reopening schools?  Tax returns? Rigged 2016? Rigged 2020? The siphoning off of USA $$$ to Russia & China?   MARY TRUMPS BOOK?   Donalds escape hatch getting readied?    #NotMyChild
20200717	1	THE ONLY ONES RUSHING TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS DON’’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE KIDS OR EDUCATION. IT’S POLITICS  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Taught 30 years. I can tell you that schools are a Petri dish for germs. Kids don’t follow/understand hygiene standards like adults do, and they constantly touch one another. Normally our bodies fight it off. Not with Covid. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Teachers are already underappreciated and paid nothing as it is. Now teachers are expected to fight a deadly disease like #Covid19 ? Teacher lives matter, student lives matter, black student lives matter. All lives matter. Teachers and students are not an experiment #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The Republicans didn’t care about gun violence in our schools, why would they care about a virus! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The same people that are running around saying they won’t where a mask because it’s government control are now demanding that you send your children to school #Hypocrisy #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The science is not "on our side." They keep saying countries which have reopened schools, but those countries have managed the virus, where have not! We are currently averaging 62K new cases a day. She even says we are the outlier. Yeah because Trump F*cked this up! #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The science should be the only thing that matters to reopen schools #NotMyChild
20200717	1	The way we'll know if @GOP really thinks it will be safe to go back to classrooms will be if they gut OSHA provisions for Workers Compensation if employees contract work related COVID19 illnesses. That would be a strike-worthy issue. #coronavirus #NotMyChild

20200717	1	They brag about being the “pro-life” party yet are doing nothing to protect our children in their own schools, whether it be from this pandemic or from school shootings - their hypocrisy knows no bounds....#NotMyChild
20200717	1	Today our school released their “return to learn” plan. The plan is fine, however recent FB postings of school sanctioned activities with no masks & no social distancing makes me pause. I will make whatever sacrifices are necessary for my children to learn from home #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump and the Republican party- abortion is a sin and it's murdering babies. Also Trump and the Republicans- We are completely reopening schools this fall and we don't care if kids die due to the virus. The hypocrisy here. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump doesn’t care about the 135,000 Americans that have died on his watch. His cronies have been released from prison due to the coronavirus. Do you really think he cares about our children?#NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump is like the mayor of Amity Island in the movie Jaws. Demanding schools open is like demanding the beaches open #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Trump wants schools open so he can say things are opening up. Trump thinks that opening schools and opening the economy will help his re-election bid. Trump does not think about the children at all.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	We would all feel very different about schools reopening if we had a goverment that: -Was trustworthy -Had best interest of children as only motivation  -Based on Science  -provided necessary resources to ALL schools -had a National plan   None of these is true   #NotMyChild
20200717	1	When @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany was pushing @realDonaldTrump's agenda to reopen schools, did I really hear her say, “The science should not stand in the way of this"?  Or am I drunk, high, in a coma...?  #kayleighlies #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpKillsUs #MAGA #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200717	1	When my 5 yr old nephew sees a mask in our hands he asks if we're going somewhere, he reminds his big brothers to bring a mask when they leave the house. He's adapted. He was excited to start school this year, but I'd rather homeschool all of them than send them in.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	When trump says,"You don't have to wear a mask." I'm wearing a mask. When trump says"Covid is a hoax." I know it's real. When trump says"Beaches,bars &casinos must open." I'm staying home.  When trump insists,"Children should go to school," during a pandemic. I shout #NotMyChild
20200717	1	Y'all have the highest school shooters numbers and the highest #COVID19 numbers but y'all want kids to go back to school.  #NotMyChild
20200717	1	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution. #NotMyChild
20200717	1	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back #NotMyChild

20200718	0	Start protesting parents and everyone who wants the Economy to be stable.  The pandemic is not as bad as initially thought.  Every child should be allowed to go to school as normal.  Face masks also make zero sense.  99.95 chance of survival and rising!   #OpenSchools
20200718	1	-thats the end of it. I'm not risking my grandparents lives over your own greedy needs. you're supposed to keep us SAFE, not put us out in HARM. we are not your puppets for you to throw around and pick up whenever you need something. KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED. #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200718	1	And to the Florida of California -  @OCDeptofEd wants to send children back to school with no masks and no social distancing so my question is this:  Why would you risk the health and well-being of our children? #NotMyChild
20200718	1	Are you a teacher? You think that will happen? It will not. Children tend to not listen in school from my Teaching pre-3rd then older 7th. I can't get behind your logic at all. Teacher will spend the day Keep your masks on wash your hands..not so close..unbelievable. #NotMyChild

20200718	1	Paul Ryan, millionaire white Republican, has 3 kids: Liza Ryan, 18, Charles, 17, and Samuel Ryan, 15.  I wonder if he will be sending them to school in a few weeks. He’s made no statement condemning the decision by his party to reopen schools. #GOPkids #notmykid #NotMyChild
20200718	1	This is heartbreaking. Someone not named Trump or DeVos needs to come up with a safe plan or just have all schools online or home school. This is our Future. #NotMyGrandchild #NotMyChild
20200718	1	We all know that opening schools during a raging killer pandemic is criminal and crazy. #NotMyChild
20200718	1	We should all be terrified that @realDonaldTrump is blocking @CDCgov from testifying on reopening schools. He’s sacrificing the lives of kids, teachers & school staff & he doesn’t want us to know. This. Is. Happening. #NotMyChild

20200719	1	I saw that. This is yet another reason why we can't open schools. These anti-mask folks ruin gains made, even work in schools and have kids. No way would I want my kid sitting next to some whacked out anti-mask kid or get an anti-mask teacher. #NotMyChild

20200719	1	Trump and Republicans WONT EVEN ALLOW THE CDC to give America guidelines to reopen schools. Republicans won’t fund what schools need to be safe. 138,000 deaths aren’t enough? You want to sacrifice our kids too? #NotMyChild
20200719	1	We are fine with opening schools with a PLAN, mandatory masks, contact tracing, onsite testing with same day results, required social distancing. PPE for teachers, staff, janitors, etc. It requires MONEY and the do-nothing GOP will provide none of that. #NotMyChild

20200720	1	Yes! This should include educators being asked to return to the classroom in the middle of a pandemic that is not under control. Schools must be online only until we have testing and tracing fully in place. #teachersareessential #WeStandTogether4SafeSchools #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
20200720	1	Yes!!  Thank you!  I’m a Florida mom and friend to many teachers who are scared to death. @GovRonDeSantis is a freaking idiot, a dangerously negligent and incompetent idiot!  #CloseTheSchools

20200722	1	Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"  #NotMyChild
20200722	1	Public schools will start out with remote learning at the beginning of the school year here in North Texas.  Private schools have not made the same announcement.  So my kid will not be saturated in neither COVID nor smug privilege while learning this year. #SchoolsMustShutdown

20200725	1	If schools don't open funding should go to the parents!?!?  1) They are open, it's virtual 2) Where is the excess capacity for these kids if they leave their current school?  This is as smart as arm the teachers. @EricTrump level smart.  #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
20200725	1	If you fail to protect a child that is called neglect. Any parent that sends their child back to school in the middle of this #TrumpVirus should be charged accordingly. I would be in jail, no way in hell would I put mine in known danger. #schoolsreopening #COVID19 #NotMyChild

20200725	1	So many educational 'categories' of students classified 'special needs.' Vary by state. Learning disabled to multiply 'handicapped' & so much more. Some are more physically vulnerable to COVID. If schools accept some, how to tell parents NO to others? No easy answers. #NotMyChild

20200726	1	I think best option for parents who are not satisfied with online classes is to shift to government schools or take a drop of one year. Many parents are happy with the online classes and let them take the advantage of it. #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	Across India, a whole spectrum of parents and the government have taken to systematic outrage and criticising of school's charging fees in the lockdown period. They say the phones, laptops and broadband charges are expensive and unnecessary. #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	By that logic, everything private, be it the FMGC industry, or automobile industry, or service sectors, all should provide free of cost services till they go bankrupt. Why only schools!? It's really sad, and makes one question the sanity of the ppl in power. :(  #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	If Private schools have earned for many years and so should not take fees for a year than logically speaking Government is collecting Taxes since 1947 so they should also give all services like petrol, electricity, water for free for one year. Shouldn't they? #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	If all are adopting  new techniques  of working  than why private schools  can not?   Please think over the resolution made on ' No school No fees'. We teachers  are working  hard beyond our boundaries, leaving all personal family responsibilities to serve kids. #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	In regard to this, the Gujarat Government decided that parents did not have to pay fees and that term fees paid so far since the lockdown be refunded by schools to parents. This decision come as an extremely insensitive and dangerous step. #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light  #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	Politicians and bureaucrats who keep calling private schools for admissions and do what not to get a seat should be reminded that your kids don’t go to Govt schools but come to us for quality education. Don’t kill the goose which lays golden eggs for you all. #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits. #SaveOurSchools

20200726	2	Which other sector has been banned from providing services or collecting revenue?  So liquor shops, malls, all were poor hand-to-mouth and show must go on for them; while all schools have been doing is exploit parents! Is that how schools have been perceived #SaveOurSchools
20200726	2	While schools planned to keep learning going for children, little did they know govt was working on cutting them from the source.  Whose intention do we trust here?  Choose your side wisely parents, it’s about your kid’s future, not temporary evasion of expense! #SaveOurSchools
