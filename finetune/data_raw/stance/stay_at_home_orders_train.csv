20200412	0	20,000 people have died from Covid-19 half of which are from one liberal city NYC.  So why shut down 50 states for a virus that hasn’t even killed 61K like the FLU.  @realDonaldTrump #COVID__19 #EasterSunday #ReopenAmericaNow @mitchellvii @RealJamesWoods @dbongino @DineshDSouza
20200414	0	@TeamCavuto @FoxNews Screw you and your law experts. @realDonaldTrump during a national emergency can write an executive order that orders local government to open up. The reason is simple federal law is supreme over state laws #COVID19 #FireFauci #ReopenNC #ReopenAmericaNow 1/2
20200418	1	A good friend is sobbing to my wife as her aunt is dying of COVID-19 because she had the nerve to get a kidney stone and have to go to a hospital. So with all due respect (which is none) fuck all of you ghouls who want to #ReopenAmericaNow.
20200418	1	Republicans in 2009: Obamacare will have death panels. If you're old or sick you're screwed.  Republicans in 2020: We gotta open the economy. So if you're old or sick you're screwed.  #COVID19 #ReopenAmerica #ReopenAmericaNow
20200418	1	The Trump admin is so short-sighted. The only reason they mention collateral damage in context of health due to the shutdown is only to weigh it against the direct #COVID19 impact purely to bolster #ReopenAmericaNow stance for economic reasons. This isn’t a people focused policy.
20200419	0	Now's the time to #ReopenAmerica . The #COVID19 models that were used to shut the country down were off by 800%, Democrat governors & mayors are using the shutdown to curtail our rights w/insane exec orders. Enough already. #ReopenAmericaNow cc: @realDonaldTrump @GovRonDeSantis
20200423	0	I did not create the meme, but, I like the analogy, not so much that image. I am DEEPLY disturbed by so much overreach by the Governors like @GovSisolak . So much of our #ConstitutionalRights being taken. No one questioning ANYTHING. #coronavirus #vegas #ReopenAmericaNow

20200626	0	Thank you, Mr. President.  Mortality rate of 0.09 for those under 65 is not worthy of a shutdown and the schools should reopen with no restrictions. #OPENAMERICANOW
20200626	0	This is a BOMBSHELL!!! CDC says an estimated 20 MILLION Americans have had the virus, most w/ NO symptoms. That lowers the death rate to .62%   WHO said the death rate was 3.4%. That is a huge difference & why it is safe to #OPENAMERICANOW

20200627	0	Exactly!  More testing equals more cases. The media fear porn is off the charts.   The correct measure is hospitalizations & death rate which are way down from the peak.  Most people who get covid19 have little to no symptoms.   We need to stop the inasankty & #OPENAMERICANOW

20200802	1	(3) #NoPantsHalloween can also serve to honor all those who suffered and who were lost during the previous nine months. We can still be mad creative and celebrate together, while promoting where our needed $$ went instead. #Halloween #StayAtHome #StayAtHomeSaveLives

20200802	1	Hard to believe there are still plenty of people who seem to believe that #stage4 in Melbourne is overkill. 6 weeks is nothing compared the the alternative. LET'S GO #StayAtHomeSaveLives
20200802	1	I broke quarantine today because my  a/c was broken and I feel so guilty #StayAtHomeSaveLives
20200802	1	What absolute rubbish! If people did the right thing instead of being selfish, we would not be in this position. Some people need the big stick before they take any notice. #StayAtHomeSaveLives

20200802	2	Prof Raj Bhopal, "Even if a vaccine is found it may not work well for older people and those with underlying health conditions."  It's been proven if you're fit & healthy you've more chance (statistically)of being killed in a car crash than die from #Covid_19 So #endthelockdown

20200803	0	Hear me on this : the ones who work in healthcare are really the ones out here partying rn and they’re were also the ones that told us to stay inside and keep distance like a month ago ... #Hypocrites #COVID19 #StaySafeStayHome
20200803	0	Many scientists around the world (who are not being paid to lie) are saying that this is the worlds biggest over-reaction to a virus. But Govts. have taken control of every aspect of life & they are not going to relinquish this power unless we make them. #nomasks #endthelockdown
20200803	0	Ponder this, nearly everyone opining for shutdowns & school closings either still has a job or is still getting paid! #EndTheNightmare #endthelockdown
20200803	0	The Govt. is insane.  Ignore everything they say and do and resume a normal life. I for one will not be staying in no matter what any Govt. idiots say. I fell for a month of the last lockdown, never again will my life be rulled by these criminals. #NoMaskOnMe #endthelockdown

20200804	0	Anyone who does not/refuses to wear a mask is better and more sensible than anyone who is falling for the Govt. control nonsense.  No idea what you think he could be spoiling for anyone. Only surgeons need masks. #NoMasks #EndCOVIDForAll #endthelockdown
20200804	0	DATELINE MONDAY AUG 3, 2020. Today the Official Groundhog of New Jersey, “Punxsutawney Phil” Murphy, popped his head out of the Gov’s Mansion, looked out, sniffed the air and twitched his whiskers, and proclaimed, “Six more weeks of quarantine!” #govmurphy #endthelockdown

20200805	1	The objectives of the Victorian government's measures are twofold: - to reduce the number of people moving around - to reduce workplace transmissions These goals need to be kept in mind by all of us or we'll be in "lockdown" for longer than we need to. #StayAtHomeSaveLives
20200805	1	The top news stories yesterday talked about how many ppl are dying, and the news stories today talk about what ppl are doing to get back outside and back to “normal life.” Ik some are eager to get back to “normal,” but they forget we’re still in QUARANTINE. #StayAtHomeSaveLives

20200805	2	This usually happens during heavy rain and today's no different:  MTA is clearing downed branches along the Q/B line from Avenue M to Newkirk.  If you're relying on the Q/B to get around today, don't. #StaySafeStayHome
