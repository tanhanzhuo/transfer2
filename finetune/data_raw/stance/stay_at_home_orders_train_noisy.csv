20200401	1	The Department of Health has confirmed 2,352 people have died after testing positive for covid-19 in the UK which is an increase of 563 reported deaths since yesterday #COVIDー19 #StayHomeStaySafe
20200401	1	The biggest diagnostics lab in India has an apparent testing capacity of 1,500 tests/day but they are barely doing 10-15% of that at this point (because of lack of #kits). Importantly, despite that, they are taking 4 days to process local samples. #COVID19 #TESTTESTTEST #lockdown
20200401	1	The government is doing a great job  indeed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, but eventually the social distancing norms will pay off in defeating it. Cooperation of the general public is paramount here. #SocialDistancing #COVIDー19 #StayHomeStaySafe

20200506	1	Hence, gradually lifting ban to this lockdown other than essentials services that give basic bread and butter to the vulnerable and low-income people is inevitable. Let's people not die. Let them work and earn amid basic Covid-19 preventive compliance. #covid19 #lockdown

20200506	1	I have listened to this several times and @MattHancock seems to be courteous and succinct in his answer to a rather pointless question. Testing is not the great cure-all that the opposition suddenly suggest. The numbers of #COVID19 cases and deaths are reducing due to #lockdown

20200506	1	If the government want people to return to work then lift the lockdown. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200506	1	If we want us to survive the next pandemic, whatever that might be, focusing on immune health must be our top priority. Beyond drugs & vaccines, that includes upgrading quality of all inputs into our body -- air, water, food/nutrition, emotional/mental #health. #Covid19 #lockdown

20200511	1	Don’t disagree with the lockdown pretty much staying in place. The thing that’s most annoying is that if it had been done PROPERLY in the first place then it wouldn’t have had to last as long as it will end up lasting #BorisJohnson #COVID19 #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	During #coronavirus outbreak, Yellow Journalists are praising few PMs & Presidents, like the followers that praised the clothes of the King while he walked naked. #GodiMedia #lockdown

20200511	1	Firstly #VandeBharathMission #vande_bharat_mission  When it came to run 15 trains... Govt took decision and announced directly! But when it was time for #ShrameekExpress ..They said let the  reciever's state CM and sender's state CM.. decide  #think #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #lockdown

20200511	1	Govt. is slightly more concerned about Economy. Economy will be improved but first our focus should be only eliminating #Corona from and Make India Corona Free Country. If number starts getting too high like Russia it is impossible to stop it's spread. #covid19 #irctc #lockdown

20200511	1	Hi guys, #BorisJohnson has spoken. Only go to work if you can, if you can go to work don’t, if you can’t, stay at home and only go to work if necessary, if not, work from home... but whatever you do .... walk there!! #COVID19 #2020 #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Home delivery has been made mandatorily cashless in #Ahmedabad. To prevent spread of #COVID19 through currency notes, it is mandatory to accept digital mode of payments through UPI and other platforms #COVID.  #lockdown
20200511	1	Honestly, I was absolutely shitting myself! The best thing is that the roads are not as busy as normal. After a month back in the saddle, I'm loving it. I'm calling a halt at the lycra though!! #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	How good would it be if all the political parties could come together for the good of this country in this pandemic,instead of trying to make themselves look good #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	How many households are going to drive stupid distances to 'beauty spots' for exercise today, swamping services & spreading unknown levels of #Covid19UK  Anyone can catch it. Anyone can spread it. There is no cure or vaccine. #coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdown #StayHomeStaySafe

20200511	1	I just wanted one more thing clarifying that had no mention and is too vague - limit contact with other people. Does that mean I can see my family and friends if I maintain social distancing? Still too many grey areas for people to exploit  #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #Boris #lockdown

20200511	1	I saw kids returning to school in Europe. I saw no masks on the kids or adults. I saw no social distancing. I felt fear. #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	I think it's time to break silence and say that SA's lockdown policy needs revisiting. There is now a massive amount of evidence internationally that the actual fatality rate of COVID-19 is less than 1/10 of what was thought previously. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	I think tonight will be seen as the beginning of the end of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. #borisspeech #EXIT #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	I thought it was pretty clear...  I know what I can and can't do and what I'll be fined for...  Can't control what others do and would never want to   Another day free from anger and judgement... And breath!  #stayingalert #COVID19 #thanksboris #lockdown

20200511	1	If anything worries me most now, it's Wuhan starting to report many cases of coronavirus. Why? Because if that happens, not only would it be bad in China, but the Chance of a second wave in Europe would be so high. #COVID #coronavirus #borisjohnsonspeech #lockdown
20200511	1	If essential workers like me have managed to work the entire lockdown as normal (with social distancing, good hygiene etc) why can’t the rest of the workforce? #COVID19 #BorisJohnson #lockdown
20200511	1	If the first ‘question from the public’ to @BorisJohnson tonight isn’t: “ARE YOU ON GLUE??” Then it’s fair to say that it is rigged #stayingalert #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	If you agree, please share by retweeting. If you have another perspective that is supported by evidence, please let me (and others) know this too. #COVID19 #lockdown

20200511	1	It is not acceptable forcing strivers back to work to make Tory donors more money. Nor is it acceptable encouraging car use. Stay alert meaningless. Lock down will be ignored. We will see rise in cases. #covid19 #coronavirus #PepsiTrump #lockdown

20200511	1	No. My pulmonologist told me one week ago today that, if I were to walk down the sidewalk following in the wake of another person walking in the same direction 30 feet ahead of me, transmission of Covid-19 from that person to me would still be possible. #StayHomeStaySafe
20200511	1	Now the modi govt is bringing up issues like POK & kailash Mansarovar to divert people from covid-19 & the govt failure over the lockdown. People are really dumb. @narendramodi #KailashMansarovar #lockdown
20200511	1	Oh, knob off Bojo Can't be 'alert' if 250,000 dickheads come down the beach when the sun's out and flood the town.  So many weren't dicisl distancing to begin with. Maybe reiterate that part. We don't want a free for all  #stayingalert #COVID19 #borisjohnsonspeech #lockdown

20200511	1	One good thing to come out of staying home..I’ve had plenty of time to research long lost members of my English family I haven’t seen them since I came to Australia in 1971....and have found them..IN SYDNEY blahahaha #coronavirusaustralia #lockdown

20200511	1	People are just going to act like the #coronavirus has gone now. Those that were will no longer try and keep 2 metres apart and you'd have thought households could mingle for the last fortnight #UKlockdown #COVID19 #lockdown

20200511	1	Reception/Year 1 back first? Send back the youngest who are least likely to be able to social distance? #COVID19 #coronavirus #BORISISBACK #lockdown
20200511	1	Remember that the majority of what was said by The PM tonight was mainly for England. The welsh government have aske EVERYONE in Wales to remain in lockdown. Please listen to this, to protect your family, your friends, your lives! #covid19 #NHS #wales #remains #in #lockdown
20200511	1	Remember when bill gates was out there talking about supply and demand like republicans know anything about economics? #COVID19 #Republicans #lockdown

20200511	1	Right folks, don’t break the rules and we can all get a nice cold Pint down the pub in July & more importantly the height of summer!? Quite simple.. #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Right. From Weds you can’t go to the pub but you can buy bottles of cider in the supermarket and meet up with people in the park. As long as you sit 2m away from each other.  #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Ring a ring o roses A pocket full of covid A tissue a tissue We all fall down #COVID19 #stayingalert #thanksboris #lockdown
20200511	1	SOON BE THE TIME TO QUARANTINE PEOPLE ARRIVING IN THE COURTY?! In what world is 32,000 deaths not the time... #BorisJohnson #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Sadly this message remind me of a song, three steps to heaven? A very dangerous move was made tonight, please stay home everyone! #Covid19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Scrubs animated series could probably be started from home and it would be just the boost we need #StayHome #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Serious question: Have the government got a brain cell between them? #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So @BorisJohnson about to Address The Nation.... But he isn't... Pre recorded bollocks.... #wheresboris #prerecorded #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So all those outings you made to get yourself phographed "doing good" were necessary were they. I don't think so #covid19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So basically we're going to exist in Schrödinger's lockdown until 2021 #coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdownUK #lockdown
20200511	1	So from Wednesday the parks and beaches will be heaving then! People won’t socially distance they will consider themselves the right to be in that space even if it’s way too busy. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So how exactly will I be sure schools are practising social distancing with 5 and 6 year olds in June?? They cant even stop nits from spreading at the best of times!! #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So is that the end of Lockdown then? Was there actually any clarification about this or did I miss it? #borisspeech #BorisJohnson #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	So no one is agitating for school to reopen but they want such to reopen. What religion has done to African cannot be fixed. #Odumeje #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #LockdownExtended #employdegreehealthcareworkers #lockdown
20200511	1	So no work for me until July possibly August! #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	So on that basis can I travel 60 miles to meet my daughter in a park for the day as long as we stay 2 metres apart? #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So technically I can meet my Daughter and Grandkids from Wednesday in a park for a picnic so long as I remain two metres apart from them. Excellent can't wait. #COVID19 #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	So there’s some outrage.. rightly so at the shambolic inept #stayingalert waffle by @BorisJohnson but like most of the appalling Tory policy and procedures it’ll be forgotten and people will continue to suffer!  #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So to be clear. According to our government, those that have been infected and those that have sadly lost there lives to #COVID19 weren’t alert enough? So had they been able to alertly duck and dive away from the invisible disease they’d have been ok? Do me a favour. #lockdown
20200511	1	So what boris is saying is that my boyfriend can go back to work and see his dad from 2 metres for the whole day (both construction) but I’m not allowed to see my family even from a 2 meter distance? How is that fair? #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	So what should someone do if employer contacts them & says "furlough over, back at work tomorrow please" when they have no childcare, no way of getting to work by car/bike/on foot, & no idea what safety measures are (or should) be in place? #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	So what year can I get a haircut? #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So you can meet one person that you know outdoors if you socially distance, but not more than one. You can meet an unlimited amount of strangers outdoors if you socially distance... I’d rather trust people that I know than strangers! #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	So, allegedly people can possibly go back to work because an R stat that has been completely made up is at 0.9. This from the same govt who opened temp Nightingale hospitals, and then realised they hadn’t got any staff to run them #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Some businesses are hard hit, others are still waiting to see the nature of the impact on their sector. But we will collectively come through this, with a focus on the common good, grit and innovation. 3/3 #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Someone help me find the name of the girl/woman that sings in these recent Yoruba movies as in sound tracks,she almost sounds like Simi.... #COVIDIOTS #BMJS #COVID19 #MercyandIkeRealityShow #sundayvibes #lockdown
20200511	1	Speak to your trade union if you're concerned about being pressured into returning to work before it's safe. There's legislation within the employment rights act to protect you. You do not have to work in an unsafe environment. #COVID19 #stayingalert #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Spike of 4,213 #COVID19 cases in the last 24 hours. Total confirmed #coronavirus cases in #India now at 67,152, including 44,029 active cases, 20,917 cured/discharged/migrated cases and 2,206 deaths: @MoHFW_INDIA #CoronaVirusUpdates #StayHomeStaySafe
20200511	1	Stay at home if you can. Go to work if you can. Socially distance if you can. Die quietly if you can. What a fantastic plan!  #BorisJohnson #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Stop talking around the subject & get on with it. #COVID19 #Boris #lockdown
20200511	1	Strange really but this is actually the biggest speech we will have had from a PM since the war ending (not that I can remember that ) #BorisJohnson #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Strap yourselves in. The way things are going I wouldn’t be surprised if Boris comes out with the line “the Titanic was effective at getting people to New York”. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Such a relief, making the most of it though, I am out now, 11.35pm, less chance of getting burnt and social distancing a touch easier. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Surprisingly decent from Boris there. #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Surviving the last week of #quarantine: 5. Listen to nature sounds. Maybe it's an app or your birdies in the tree outside your home, either way, it will calm the brain. Nature sounds are truly relaxing and anxiety-relieving. #nature #quarantinelife #quarantinestories #lockdown
20200511	1	Talking to my bestfriend of 16 years on FaceTime tonight has made me feel so unbelievably sad. She is pregnant. I can’t be there for her. I don’t know when this will ever be truly over - but please god it will be soon. #coronavirus #friends #pregnant #lockdown
20200511	1	Thank you lord because 2020 is still a wonderful year for me regardless of what's happening around the world.   I choose to be positive.   #COVID19 #survivor2020 #lockdown
20200511	1	Thankyou Boris Johnson for that unclear and contradictory message which is going to make work tomorrow incredibly stressful and confusing for social workers and most importantly for children and their carers also.   #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	That's so inspiring. Really Appreciate. HatsOff to you #Urvashi. Very well done. Hope that this war will gonna end soon and we will definitely gonna win this.  #lockdown #COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives #stayhomestaystrong #wewillwintogether #worldfightscorona #StayHomeStaySafe
20200511	1	The art of lockdown survival is to complete each and every task that you wanted to do in the normal days. Trust me, 24 hours will be less in a day... #trojanprime #coronavirus #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	The happy fisherman is now running round the house and the teenager mortified at school potential, me! I Still don't know if I can gobto work on the bus!  #StayAlert #fishinglife #schoolsreopening #publictransport #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	The media build up to.. "We're reopening garden centres" ... Is frankly ridiculous. Anyone would think it was an announcement of the second coming!!  #prerecorded #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	The school where my wife works has 800 kids,reception to yr6 Getting them to school, dropping them off,picking them up can involve different households & transport,Teachers & staff 140+! It’s taking a fcuking big chance if you ask me #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	The seats in church think we all went to heaven. While the seats in bars and clubs think we all got saved.   #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	The suggestion that people in manufacturing jobs should drive rather than take public transport has to be the most elitist view I’ve heard in this crisis. Yeah sure everyone can afford a car in some of the lowest paid factory jobs. And wtf is stay alert?! #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Then find something to work on in any capacity, you'll begin to see that you're skilled, you're someone who is learning, growing and pushing their way forward!  #mondaythoughts #MondayMotivation #COVID19 #Ramadan #BoisLockerRoom #stayingalert #lockdown
20200511	1	These people who gave caught Coronavirus in the last couple of weeks and aren’t key workers? Who are they actually mixing with.. clearly not adhering to the lock down rules. So God help us now there is an easing  #lockdown
20200511	1	They must have decided that it was better for Boris Johnson to pre-record the address than doing it live, meaning/hoping he won't waffle as much and look like he has some of a clue.   Our PM cannot be trusted with live TV....How reassuring.   #BorisHasFailed #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Thinking about it, I do quite understand Boris Johnson’s speech tonight. Basically the lockdown continues socially but if you can’t work from home, go to work? Is that right? #BorisJohnson #PM #coronavirus #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	This is my guess: This month we’re given ‘covid safe’ guidelines, from July 1st we can apply to EHO/TSA for ‘covid safe’ inspection for sign off to reopen.   Hence why he’s said some venues  Thoughts? #hospitality #coronavirus #boris #lockdown
20200511	1	This is not a lockdown exit strategy. This is a plan to restart the economy. What about when we can see our families? All along,money has come before humanity. #BorisHasFailed #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	This is ridiculous @realDonaldTrump telling people the #COVID19 numbers are going down. No, trump, they are going up.  Your lies cause death.  Facts not appearances. What about the kids now? #StayHome #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #StayHomeStaySafe
20200511	1	Three rules for basic personal safety: don’t cross the road without looking, don’t step on the live rail, and don’t accuse a working parent in lockdown of having lots of free time on their hands. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Time to shut the Scottish border after that horror of a #Statement from #BorisJohnson... #COVID19 #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Times like these i wish I'd stayed in N. Ireland #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	To prove I was concentrating..... did the PMs thumbs grow DURING the broadcast?  I need to focus #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Tommorow now Wike will come here and say he doesn't have enough Isolation centres , what stop you from converting said building into COVID isolation centre or hospital and then fining the owner when he wants to recover it post #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #lockdown
20200511	1	Translator please?   I’ve rarely, if ever, heard such ambiguous drivel in my life.  A ridiculous explosion of non-data, non-detail and non-information requiring a degree to be alert of what we are actually allowed to do.  Utter shambles #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Two important words - Corporate Manslaughter. #COVID19 #lockdownuk #lockdown
20200511	1	Two more months of lockdown. This is absolutely absurd. Those at extreme risk should be welcome to stay at home but society should be reopened. Restrictions on freedom being put in place by a conservative government of all things have gone on for long enough #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	US unemployment of 14.7%, is that a real number?  #COVID19 #unemployment #lockdown
20200511	1	Ugh. Felt sick all day. I don’t trust this gvt to make any if the right decisions. I don’t trust them with our lives. They’re at best, incompetent, at worst, evil. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Underwhelmed #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Was it only me that thought @BorisJohnson speech was really clear and easy to understand? Don’t see why there is so much confusion. Obviously not every detail can be covered in 15 minutes but the main strategy was clear  #COVID19 #lockdown

20200511	1	We control the economy it's a man made thing. We can't bring someone back from the dead so let's really think about  what is more important. #StayHome #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	We're not ending #lockdown.  We're modifying it with a change of emphasis, apparently. Those who can't work from home should go to work, safely. #BorisJohnson #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Well that has cleared has things up..... #BorisJohnson #COVID19 #lockdown

20200511	1	While @jidesanwoolu is working, building isolation centers & Lagos is producing some reagents to combat the Covid-19 pandemic @GovWike is busy demolishing hotels of violators.  What a paradox. #Covid-19 #Wike #lockdown
20200511	1	While it might not have been particularly illuminating, the fact that people are saying nothing has changed is a testament to how many people previously weren’t following the guidelines  #coronavirus #lockdown
20200511	1	Who else is disappointed in the government’s lack of response to over 55,000 people dying?! Did the announcement just spike your anxiety?   I feel physically sick  #COVIDIOTS #coronavirus #lockdown

20200511	1	Why are people overreacting about the lockdown not being lifted???? #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Why are people pretending that they don’t understand what Boris just said? Even if you hate him don’t make yourself look like a mong, it was pretty straight forward #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Why do people need their hands held over this, use your common sense. It’s not rocket science. Stop bitching and get on with it. Get yourself off to work if you feel you can be safe. If not, don’t. #COVID19 #lockdown
20200511	1	Why is the @NigeriaGov not using @flyairpeace to evacuate Nigerians from all these countries?  I think it will be a big boost for the company because @flyairpeace is our own. @abikedabiri @GeoffreyOnyeama   Wike | Rivers | Agba | #COVID19 | #lockdown

20200607	1	I have been baffled by the “we’re following the science” line right from the start of #coronavirus.  Because it shouldn’t require scientists to tell you that nipping a problem in the bud before it gets out of hand will result in fewer deaths & disastrous consequences. #lockdown

20200628	1	I think the main issue re covid was the reticence by the WHO/Western Govs about  a symptomatic transmission. The borders would have closed sooner and people locked down sooner. Scientists/Medicos standings have fallen so low that gov’s listen to economists 1st.#lockdown

20200701	1	If you really want to celebrate doctor's day or appreciate doctors for their work, then the best way to do it would be to reduce their burden by reducing the no. of cases i.e. staying home.  Thank you to all the doctors! #DoctorsDay #StayHomeStaySafe

20200710	1	It is. Now, ask yourself if it was truly necessary? Given everything we know “now”. The possibility that politicians are either: a) still ignorant of the real science  b) unwilling to acknowledge it, or  c) something worse is quite terrifying. We need a review. #covid #lockdown

20200727	1	The "kids need to be in school" crowd goes silent when you ask how many deaths is acceptable to them.   Do casket companies offer pre-order discounts? What about bulk buying child-sized ones?  #Biden2020 #100DaysToGo #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask #RidenWithBiden #StayHomeStaySafe

20200727	1	The method of averaging out the bill is completely flawed. Can you not ask the consumers to send a snapshot of their meters and send bills on the basis of the same ?? I have received 5 times the normal electricity bill!!Please fix this at the  earliest @myBESTElectric.#lockdown

20200728	1	Sanitarium Waltz part 1 - by me  2 metres, face masks, converse through plastic screens. Get online, lock down, the March of the machines.  Browse YouTube, PornHub, consumed by fantasies. Log back on, zone out, wait for deliveries.  #poetry #poems #lockdown
20200728	1	Sanitarium Waltz part 2 - by me  Tesco queues, home school, censor and sanitise.  Contactless, obey, life is homogenised.  Tow the line, follow, who cares if you complain. Cat COVID, furloughed, two extra weeks in Spain.  #poetry #poems #lockdown

20200731	1	Bring back the scorpions  Zuma  Made SA finances lootable from when he was in power, by firing scorpions he knew he would be walking free in they were still operating ,scorpions would recover everything that was looted #bringbackscorpions #shaka #500Billion #COVID19SA #lockdown

20200731	1	Can I have people round for drinks if I charge them? #lockdown
20200731	1	Can it really be the case that pubs and bars pose less of a risk than private homes? The Spanish don’t seem to think so. Or is it the case that this govt more willing to regulate the home than the market? Seems unconscionable to impose on Muslims hours before Eid #lockdown
20200731	1	Can someone please pay me for staying at home? Thanks #StayHomeStaySafe
20200731	1	Can't go to my mum's or even in the garden but I can see them still in the gym, pub or a restaurant! Bradford lockdown #lockdown
20200731	1	Can’t keep up with these lockdown measure changes, me  Get me on one of them Tesla space ship things, I want off this planet. The world’s gone mental, cha, I’m tellin ya  #lockdown
20200731	1	Can’t say anything as it’s ‘racist’ but certain ‘groups’ are not adhering to ANY rules. The areas effected all have something in common. Covidiots. Do it care about anyone. #lockdown
20200731	1	Covid19 rise because of people not being able to social distance. Nothing to do with bars, pubs, restaurants and gyms opening within the last couple of weeks. Government always gets it right! #jokes #COVID19 #northen #lockdown

20200731	1	Doesn't affect me but families from Gr Mcr or W Yorks, if get asked by police just tell them you got an urgent childcare issue & also need to check your eyesight. If they need any further info, contact Mr D Cummings, 10 DowningStreet. He knows #lockdownextension #lockdown

20200731	1	From tomorrow, employers in England will have the discretion to decide how their staff can work safely, either from home or in the workplace.   Do you expect this to change your organisation's approach? Have you been consulted on your preference? #GovUK #BorisJohnson #lockdown
20200731	1	Further lockdown easing in England has also been postponed for at least a fortnight.  #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #uk #lockdown
20200731	1	Good! Cases are spiking and it's essential that action is taken to stop the spread. #StayAtHomeSaveLives
20200731	1	Govt announcement just effectively cancelled Eid for thousands in the North of England #eid #lockdown
20200731	1	Govt scared to lockdown the south of England? Kind of the vibes getting from Hancock on #BBCBreakfast... also didn’t seem that confident or clear with answers (shock)... #lockdown
20200731	1	Grant Shapps travelling to Spain, then travelling back was part of the performance. Cummings knows that the reputation of Tory ministers is shot, and that they have no shame. They will make themselves look like idiots to further his cause. #lockdown

20200731	1	Hey @BorisJohnson, can you explain to me why MEN can have their beard trimmed (a close contact activity) but WOMEN can’t have brows/eyelashes/facial treatments? I’m struggling to follow the science here and I’m a Doctor!? Feel so sorry for the beauty industry! #beauty #lockdown
20200731	1	Hey guyz, hope u all safe and good. Today its eid and i wish ya all a very happy eid ul adha mubark. #EidAdhaMubarak #StayHomeStaySafe
20200731	1	Hi @MattHancock - any clarification of your rediculous announcement at 9pm last night?! What are key workers (or any workers) supposed to do about childcare? Schools are shut. Holiday clubs full because of limited capacity. Are they supposed to not work from today?  #lockdown
20200731	1	How would I even know if I was? #lockdown
20200731	1	Hurrah! Another set of government rules so baffling that it needs a hastily arranged Downing Street briefing with the PM to make them even more incomprehensible. Oh how we've missed them! Looking forward to seeing how uncomfortable Prof Whitty looks at this one... #lockdown
20200731	1	I  don't understand what goes through these peoples heads when they're making huge decisions that effect the country. How does it make sense that it is still okay to mix in public places.. But you mix households? And don't tell me its because of social distancing #lockdown
20200731	1	I despair! I’m sick of seeing yet another thick cunt on @BBCBreakfast saying they’re “confused”! You’re a bloody GP for gods sake. The guidance is quite clear. #COVIDIDIOTS #lockdown
20200731	1	I don’t believe #boris would announce a lockdown at Christmas with a few hrs notice. The country would go nuts. Think about it. Christmas Eve evening after you’ve spent a fortune on food and presents #eid #discrace #lockdown
20200731	1	I filled up last in February.  Still have a quarter tank  #lockdown
20200731	1	I live in #Bury can't see family at home but can meet them in the pub or the gym.  Is that right? #lockdown
20200731	1	I think Boris saw me get excited about booking tickets to see a drag show next weekend, that he had to respond by cancelling performances #lockdown
20200731	1	I thought the week just started let's enjoy it a bit . But just now I find out tomorrow is FRIDAY.   Days are flowing out, #COVID__19 flowing in .  Stop any one of them.  #StayHomeStaySafe

20200731	1	It would have to be @ailecphoto for looking after not one, but two mums during #lockdown
20200731	1	It's baffling to me. What about 150,000 dead Americans is hard to comprehend?  Other than being devastatingly sad.  A virus looks for a host; it doesn't care who you are.  Full freaking stop.   #WearAMask  #WashYourHands #SocialDistance #StayHomeStaySafe
20200731	1	It's fine. I didn't want you in my house anyway... #lockdown
20200731	1	Its a poor announcement from the government. What if the household were mixed before 12. Does that mean coming out of the home and travelling back to whatever city (a.k.a London) you were at previously? People drove to those households who haven't had symptoms. #eid #lockdown
20200731	1	Its not difficult #GreaterManchester #lockdown
20200731	1	I’ve worked my arse off for months since lockdown; I’m really drained. On leave next week...with my dear sis...in Manchester. Bury in fact, where covid-19 rates are low. We have our health; I know I should be grateful. But can I feel just a little bit disappointed? #lockdown
20200731	1	Just spent the last ten minutes trying to work out if it’s Thursday or Friday....checked my phone and the tv and my diary and still not entirely sure #lockdown

20200731	1	Loads of calls from home based and visiting salons and beauticians this morning asking for clarification of what they can and cannot do. It doesn't look good for them but nothing explicit in the guidance. #locallockdown #COVID19 #lockdown
20200731	1	Local half arsed lockdowns in a tiny Country with 66 million people will be as effective as an ash tray on a motorbike. #coronavirusuk #lockdown
20200731	1	Lockdown is lockdown.  If we have to at Christmas.  Will have to like it or lump it.  Stop being fucking stupid.  Would you rather have a mask on or a ventilator.   Think about that! #lockdown
20200731	1	Lockdown may be over, however the pandemick is not even nearly done yet. Be responsible and safe. #covid19 #pandemic #lockdown
20200731	1	Lol you talk as much shirt as they do , then side with them . Seriously this is CONTROL not #lockdown
20200731	1	Mask & Social Distance is not enough now, please do the complete #Lockdown,  day by day   #Covid Case are increasing. The public is really need the complete lockdown now . Its the time to #SaveSomeLife  ... Request you to kindly implement a #lockdown.  #StayHomeStaySafe
20200731	1	No visits to other houses in Greater Manchester. No worries just meet up in the pub. Lockdown not Lockdown. #coronavirus #lockdown
20200731	1	Normal is overrated. #lockdown

20200731	1	Not going to lie.... even I think they are just winging this now!  #lockdown
20200731	1	Note to some London based journos: Greater Manchester, East Lancs and Kirklees is not the entire 'North of England'. #lockdown
20200731	1	Nothing and No one has the ability to steal my joy! I have to stay with a mindset of #lockdown
20200731	1	Of course I wont be going anywhere - I will be safely quarantined in my back garden #StayHomeStaySafe
20200731	1	Oh and Wythenshawe Estate is NOT in Cheshire #lockdown
20200731	1	Oh dear!We have just been put back on Lockdown for the next two weeks.That’s it. #CoronaIsReal #StayHomeStaySafe #StayHomeStaySafe

20200731	1	Our doorbell has inadvertently reset its ring to Auld Lang’s Syne. This is even more baffling in 35c heat #lockdown
20200731	1	Our government and its leader are an utter joke! #coronavirusuk #lockdown
20200731	1	Our government can suck a fat one. #BorisHasFailedTheUK #lockdown
20200731	1	People are laughing at everyone not knowing if they live in Greater Manchester or not... but half the Cheshire Housewives live in Hale which is technically Trafford/Greater Manchester.... its not clear on the boundaries & because the boundaries are always changing #lockdown
20200731	1	People in the new ‘re-lockdown’ areas can’t meet with people out of their own homes including in pubs or restaurants. But it’s still fine for them to go to work. The rules don’t make medical sense. #lockdown
20200731	1	Please change your slogan when you can't seem to get it right! Hands, Sfpace, Sfpace????...... @BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet #Covid19UK #manchesterlockdown #Salford #lockdown
20200731	1	Plenty of clarity! We can meet nan indoors but only in the presence of a waiter wielding a credit card reader. #Newsnight #GreaterManchester #lockdown
20200731	1	Pretty sure NSW will be in lockdown in 2 weeks #coronavirus #COVID19 #NSW #lockdown
20200731	1	Rather cruel to impose total lockdown in towns with large Muslim communities - with very little notice - just before Eid. Some  may say racist even #Calderdale #lockdownextension #lockdowncalderdale #lockdown
20200731	1	Retagging mild and asymptomatic with "recovered" IS FUCKING NOT OKAY! If you tagged them as recovered, will they be allowed to go out and SPREAD THE FUCKING VIRUS? Will they contribute their plasma? Is this even based on WHO guidelines?  #DuqueResign #MassTestingNowPH #lockdown
20200731	1	Simon says don’t go to the pub. Simon says go to the pub and he’ll pay for your meal. Go to the pub! What!? Why did you go to the pub? Simon says you didn’t listen! @Nerd_CB #GreaterManchester #lockdown
20200731	1	So - casinos- are they open ? #casinos #lockdown
20200731	1	So I can't go round me parents house but I can meet them in the pub?  No wonder folk don't bother listening to any of the advice #lockdown
20200731	1	So I can't meet certain family members in their homes in Greater Manchester, but we can do a session at the gym together, go shopping and then treat ourselves to a meal, drinks and some COVID-19 at a bar. #confuseddotcom #Lockdownmanchester #lockdown
20200731	1	So I can't see my family at my home but ok see them in a pub? Makes no sense #GreaterManchester #lockdown
20200731	1	So I live in one of the areas where we are not able to met up with others inside each other’s houses.   But meeting in the pub or restaurants is allowed! Is it any wonder people are confused and frustrated?  #COVID__19 #COVID19 #lockdown
20200731	1	So am i correct in saying that you can go to work and then go to pub for a pint and go for a meal after a bit of shopping but you cant go to your mums to check if she is alright? #Covid19UK #lockdown
20200731	1	So does this include your work colleagues as well? #lockdown
20200731	1	So to be clear, I can’t visit my parents and bear near 2 people yet I can still go to the pub and be near 200? #lockdown
20200731	1	Some conspiracy theories floating around with the #LeicesterLockdown well people believe anything they hear/read. You broke the lockdown rules to begin with sadly.....  #lockdownextension #LockdownLeicester #lockdown
20200731	1	Step 1. Followed  Step 2. Retweeted  Step 3. Wears mask everytime I goes out  #StayHomeStaySafe

20200731	1	The government guidence is out for the Greater Manchester lockdown and it's just the lyrics to the Hokey-Kokey #lockdown
20200731	1	The issue for me with local lockdowns is that if people for whatever reason haven’t been following the guidelines & it’s caused a spike in cases why are they going to listen to the new guidelines? It just penalises the people in those areas who have been complying #lockdown
20200731	1	The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.   #codinglife #mindset #CodeNewbie #Motivation #lockdown
20200731	1	The opportunity we've had to improve ourselves in this lockdown will never again present itself in our lifetime. It's just a matter of time before some persons realize that they're damned. #forex #forexsignals #Crypto #cryptocurrencies #bitcoin #Ethereum #lockdown
20200731	1	The ‘parts of West Yorkshire’ are Kirklees, Bradford and Calderdale. Three fairly large areas... #lockdown
20200731	1	There is the growing number of cases of infected people in the capital & still government is forcing to take exams. How is this safe ? #noexam #voiceofstudents #savelife #savefuture #students #exams #NEB #HSEB #education #nepal #covid #lockdown
20200731	1	This bloody virus is clever isn’t it? It can tell if you’re sat with your family at home or in a pub or restaurant. Terrifying stuff. #lockdown
20200731	1	This only goes on to show how divided this country along economic lines. Its a shame that the poor citizens bear the tough sting of the whip of the law,  while the rich in power enjoy wielding the warm whip.  #StayHomeStaySafe
20200731	1	This virus is a tricky little fucker!  It attacks you if want to visit a friend's house or have family around to your place but it lets you go to the pub, gyms, work, shops and public transport. Crafty  #COVID__19 #Manchester Back on #lockdown
20200731	1	Though Eid is a time to come together for the celebration, however considering the unprecedented time, let's stay home and connect with extended family and friends through phone and video calls. Let's stop the spread of Corona Virus. #StaySafeStayHome
20200731	1	Turns out that playing whack-a-mole sucks, eh @MattHancock?#lockdown
20200731	1	UK Government is such a joke. Bringing in another lockdown for greater Manchester, East Lancs and Yorkshire so you can't go to your friends/family's house, BUT YOU CAN STILL GO TO THE PUB, A RESTAURANT OR PRIMARK #lockdown
20200731	1	Unfortunately coming out of Sydney during  #lockdown
20200731	1	Wait, so in Manchester you can’t go round to a friends garden but you can go to the pub!? #lockdown
20200731	1	Was this really all announced on twitter? #lockdown
20200731	1	We all said it when we saw the crowded beaches....the Government needs clear policies and strategies. #lockdown

20200731	1	Well we had a great investigation lined up for Saturday but I don't think that's going to happen now. Always the way. #lockdownextension #lockdown
20200731	1	We’ve just had our second lot of holidaymakers in the AirBnB next door... How to hasten the spread of Coronavirus... #lockdown
20200731	1	What about shops, bars, restaurants, places of worship?? #COVID19 #lockdown
20200731	1	What's good right now is stopping the spread of this virus so people don't die unnecessarily.  I hope you're doing your part to #StayHomeStaySafe

20200801	0	So will you accept any and every law that is imposed on us just because he is the PM?   No matter how stupid, how pointless or how dangerous? Do you really think the title PM gives him total power over our ever move ? #notmypm #NoMasks #endthelockdown
20200801	0	The elimination ship sailed in March. Opportunity has been lost. Harsher lockdowns are not viable and useless. Destroying economy and mental health. We must adapt to carry on our normal lives with the virus. #endthelockdown

20200801	0	Why are we allowing politicians to dictate how we live?  They decide where and when we can go, if our children can go to school,  if we can play a sport or go to church and even how we vote.  Have we lost our minds?  This needs to end.   #freedom #endthelockdown

20200803	1	Intelligent caring people wear a mask to protect themselves & others. Selfish inconsiderate ones refuse so set a poor example & endanger others. #WearAMask #parenting #COVID19 #lockdown
20200803	1	It's August 2nd and I simultaneously feel like the last 5 months were actually 10 years and stunned that it's already August. I feel like I was robbed of my entire summer. I bet it's even worse for the kids. #lockdown
20200803	1	It's only Day 1 of Hard Lockdown in Victoria and I'm already absentmindedly singing the Sexyland ad theme. It's gonna be a long six weeks.  #COVID19 #lockdown

20200803	1	Latest panic buying? Toilet paper again? Only actual shortages are induced by this? Many seem to have little understanding of supply chains? Fresh veggies don't keep long. Has our #supermarket based culture induced a kind of abstracted disconnect around #food? #covid19 #lockdown
20200803	1	Leafs aren’t going to get 5 shots in 3rd...#lockdown
20200803	1	Life will not be the same. As many people will be unemployed and also some students will not be able to go back to xul as some are getting married and some pregnancies. And also some will get used to mask and social distancing so we will be practicing them.     #StayHomeStaySafe

20200803	1	Nor to sacrifice their children or other less visible victims (like cancer patients)  - which is what’s happening. Politicians like @Anna_Soubry  have locked themselves into a populist hysterical narrative they can’t now escape from.  Sweden are not stupid, we are. #lockdown

20200803	1	Remember to wash your hands, wear a face mask and keep social distance. COVID19 is real. #StaySafeStayHome
20200803	1	Reminder:  The ball is still in your court.  "Either work for your own dreams or work for someone else's dreams."  #Dreams #Life #seldependent #entrepreneurlife #workhard #lockdown
20200803	1	Ridiculous but true!! Allowed to remove mask when walking if have take-away. So...be like a cop in a movie and pretend to be drinking from an empty coffee cup. #Masks #MaskUp #mask #lockdown
20200803	1	Sarah Jarvis is a (consistently patronising) GP, not an 'expert' @theJeremyVine.  Caprice (very gracefully) was quoting epidemiologists. #COVID19 #Masks #lockdown
