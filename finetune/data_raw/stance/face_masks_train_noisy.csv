20200625	1	An individual I know could have been exposed to Covid.Sad thing is testing is not available until Saturday with a multi day turnaround.REALLY?This whole effort to combat this virus is a joke. This isn’t a damn political issue.Get over yourself politicians. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	And don’t forget the mountain of cash towards medical bills—plus every ounce of your dignity—a two week stint in the ICU will cost you. The argument that the death rate is dropping (which was expected with more testing) so no need to worry is asinine. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	And they were outside wearing masks. Enclosed places without masks are going to yield more cases of COVID. Also why hasn’t Fox News (where the truth goes to die) actually done research and find protesters with COVID? #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	And your point is...? To sum up: “I’m in my 20s, I am an epidemiology expert and have decided I won’t get sick with it and will be fine, so I don’t care if you get sick because my life will be ruined if I wear a mask”? Did I get that right ?#WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Another reason to wear a mask:  I don't have to worry about wearing makeup or sunscreen.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Anyone out here not wearing a damn mask will screw everything up when we have to go back into a shelter in place #WearADamnMask #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Are all U.S. @kroger stores requiring all employees and customers to wear a mask?  #WearADamnMask #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Are we just ignoring the record spikes in Coronavirus cases in Oklahoma? 482 more cases in one day!!! I'm a registered voter and you're not protecting me.  @GovStitt @gtbynum @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	As a doctor I wear masks in work to protect others and myself. I also wear masks in shops to protect everyone else....I have spares in my bag, my car, at my front door....I do it to protect everyone else. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	As of press conf today by Gov of NC masks are now required outside and in stores etc all over NC. Don't know yet if there are fines.  Without consequences lots of people are too selfish to wear masks. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	As someone actively taking patients from Covid units back home or back to the nursing home, for them to basically wait to die: WEAR A MASK. It’s not a pretty situation in there, trust me. Young, old, black, white, or purple- it doesn’t discriminate. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Aside from the nursing home problems, NJ governor Murphy has done a good job. He has taken his time with opening.  Great news that he & Cuomo are requiring people from hotspot states to quarantine if coming here. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Assholes who refuse masks should get the same treatment women who need abortion services get. Require watching hours of video of ppl dying of covid, saying bye to loved ones, and RNs/docs just struggling to hang on. More effective than your shitty dead baby signs. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Attend a #BLM PROTEST! Bring a case of water, some snacks, and protective equipment like goggles, masks etc. keep each other safe #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Be a ninja when you bring another wonderful soul onto this Earth  Congratulations and be safe Giulia. Please Y'all, wear your friggin mask! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Because the majority of the population is still susceptible to coronavirus infection & until there's a vaccine, BC will still be at risk of new cases spreading from elsewhere... Masks>>lockdown #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Believe in science. I wear a mask for you. You wear a mask for me. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Better to #WearADamnMask and let people think you might be stupid, than not wear one and remove all doubt   #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Between the pandemic, racism, and police brutality, entitled white people are getting on my last nerve. Get over yourselves, educate yourself, and wear a bloody mask.   #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Bitch it’s getting worse and some covidiots are complaining about face covering regulation. Y’all better fine their asses for reals!! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Breaking News: Dentists everywhere thrilled by mask wearing.  One dentist was quoted,  “With daily mask usage, you will only forget to brush your teeth one time.” #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Bruce Springsteen blasts Donald Trump in @SiriusXMFranco   “Show some consideration and care for your countrymen and your country,” @springsteen says to Trump :  "Put on a fucking mask”   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	But CO2 has a C and an O and another O.  It's the Os you know, they get stuck in the fibers of the mask and they can't escape and the Os from the O2 outside can't come in....so you can't breathe and you die! .  <Eyeroll> #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	CDC said masks don’t work.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Caesar Entertainment is requiring anyone entering their properties across the United States to wear a face mask to limit the spread of the #coronavirus, the resorts company announced today.  @CaesarsPalace @CaesarsEnt  Thank you!  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Cannot believe I have to say this - COVID is not over by a long shot.  Wear a mask.  People are still infectious.  You are not a rebel by not wearing a mask - you just tick me off. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Coming from someone who's state is skyrocketing in the wrong direction. We'd love to have you visit our state. However, @NYGovCuomo just mandated that visitors from LA must quarantine for 14 days prior. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Comparing wearing a mask to Nazi Germany, reallly???  This world has gone mad.  Can we cancel these people please!!!  Wearing a mask is nowhere near how Jews were treated during WWII.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Congresswoman, this is just NOT true and you should be reported to @TwitterSafety for endangering public health. Shame on you.  TRUMP'S OWN MODEL said wearing masks will save 30,000 lives.  What is wrong with you? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Coronavirus has really revealed how many whiny, entitled brats live in this country.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Coronavirus will still kill you.  Things are opening back up because this country values money more than your life.  #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Damn, people a pretty butthurt seeing others having the freedom to choose. If people dont want to wear a mask so be it, they know the risks. People really think im a mass murderer if I choose not to wear a mask. Unbeliveable. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Day 2: I won the internal debate over what to wear to work. Shorts it is because I’m #workingfromhome AGAIN! Don’t just carry a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Dear @marcorubio  If you really do understand the science and the importance of masks please show us that you are a real leader...now you need to convince @GovRonDeSantis to order the entire state to wear masks in public. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Dear FLA, TX, CA Get your shit together.  #WearAMask #wearadamnmask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Deplorable was kind word for these idiot backward ignorant racist fools who apparently didnt go to second gd grade. #mask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Despite overwhelming evidence and advice from the medical/science industry Gov. Abbott chose to open TX too early and now thousands more people will be exposed to COVID-19 and potentially with fatal consequences. #AbbottResign #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Discussions on mandatory face masks with some saying they are uncomfortable to wear. Seriously? I'll take a little discomfort over pandemic everytime. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Do I think a mask is will help? Not really; wash your damn hands and stop hugging each other. However, a piece of cloth on my face does not prevent me from day to day activities and if it slows this down and ultimately gets this over with, I’m fine wearing one.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Do you feel like your freedoms are taken away or that you are being controlled when you choose to buckle your seat belt or give a friend your keys if you're buzzed or drunk? No? Then why do you feel this way about wearing a mask? #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Do you think the number of #MAGAts who die because they refuse to wear a mask is enough to offset the number of Dems who can't vote do to voter suppression tactics?  #VoteByMail #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Doctors, listen to the scientist, listen to Dr. Fauci heed his warnings about face mask if not, the other mask you will be wearing in an oxygen mask, it’s your choice. Cherish your life, don’t be a statistic. There’s someone that loves you. #coronavirus #COVID__19 #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Don't B stupid like #IdiotInChief . #WearADamnMask ...Or don't wear a mask and then have a tube pushed down your throat &pray u will survive #Coronavirus.  #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Dr Lucy Jones, the person all of Southern California trusts during earthquakes, says we should all be wearing masks! It’s simple Science! Don’t share your air! Trust her! Listen! #Dontshareyourair #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Drinking and driving is illegal because it puts everyone else’s well being at risk along with your own.  The same is true of not wearing a mask.  Don't be an asshole.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Dudes.... I just went to take my bra off.... to realize I wasnt even wearing one. #QuarantineLife #ContinuesocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	During the Spanish flu pandemic police in Arizona handed out $10 fines,about $170 today, if people didnt wear face masks out in public. Maybe we should take a lesson from history & start handing out $170 to assholes who refuse to wear a mask in public. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Even if you have the right to risk your own life, depending on state laws, by not wearing a mask, you absolutely do NOT have the right to risk the lives of others! Those lives include your family, friends, coworkers, and strangers. We all have the right to live! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Everyone should #StayHome until they can get a #coronavirus test or until there's adequate #TestAndTrace because a #vaccine is still at least 1 year away - it'll take at least 2 years for that to hit the market. Do not go out without proper #PPE.    #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Everytime I go outside to shoot around at the local basketball courts I wear a mask. Everyone always asks me, "why?". HELLO WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Ew, it doesn’t breathe through those thick jeans #FloridaWoman #Floriduh #COVID19 #PalmBeachCounty #COVIDIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Exactly what are these medical conditions that these people claim they have that they can’t wear a mask? I’ve never heard any of them say what the condition is. AND if you have something chronic wouldn’t you want to protect yourself?! I have asthma but I still #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Exactly! We would be wise to hold the line.  #PhysicalDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Excuse me, what? Guess I can’t go out to eat anymore. #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	FYI, wearing a mask does not violate your personal freedoms.  It doesn’t stop you from doing anything.  It’s just common sense. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Face masks and shields of all kinds can be found at reasonable prices on @Woot #coronavirus #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	First day back to work as a massage therapist. Wearing PPE (mask and face shield) makes it harder. Tough to breathe and I sweat a lot more than usual, but we gotta stay safe. Nothing but respect for front line hospital workers.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Florida Man came in second place, Florida woman rules the day. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	For the LOVE OF GOD wearing a mask isn’t about YOU- it’s about being MINDFUL OF OTHERS you selfish idiots! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	For those of you rolling the dice on #COVID19 : maybe you won't get it. Maybe you will but suffer only minor, temporary symptoms. Maybe, just maybe, you'll get very ill and suffer permanent damage. Worst of all, maybe you pass it on to someone who isn't so lucky. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	For those of you selfish, self absorbed fvckwads whining, 'I feel like I'm suffocating', or 'I have anxiety' about wearing a mask to protect others from #COVID19 Go to your nearest funeral home, climb into a casket, close the lid. See how that feels. Mask or Dead #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Force face masks, Stanley county has about a 5% usage of face masks, I’m 22 weeks pregnant and before I was showing people would call me a “liberal pussy” and a “libtard” just for wearing a mask  can’t fix stupid, but U can force it to make better decisions #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Forget "Ride or Die" It's "Mask or Die" now, motherfuckers #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Friendly reminder that women are going through labor and giving birth in masks I think you're going to be okay wearing one while you shop at Costco #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Friendly reminder: The nose goes inside the mask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Gee who could have seen that coming? #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Gentle Reminder: Donald Trump has NO plan whatsoever to combat COVID-19. None. We're on our own. And the mask-haters will be the first to go. Please hurry. The rest of us have work to do. #MAGA2020 #TrumpVirus2020 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Governor Sisolak just made masks mandatory in Nevada! I am the queen of mask shaming my husband says I’m going to get punched I said bring it on. Now when they tell me they don’t have to wear a mask I can say yes you fuc*ing do!!! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Grad parties, sand bar lake get togethers Life is happening and we want to keep it that way. #WearADamnMask  With your rights come Responsibilities  #WearADamnMask  Want Schools to open back up #WearADamnMask Keep your elderly family safe #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Guess who lives in Utah, works in the public, wears a mask everyday to work, but sees almost all customers that come into my place of work and are not? Many. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Guy Phillips is a special kind of white privileged human. Insensitive, selfish and undeserving to be a part of government. #WearAMask #BlackLivesMattters #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Happy National Wear a Mask Day, ya filthy animals. To celebrate #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Has he met the #FloridaWoman who thinks masks interfere w “God’s breathing system”? They’d make a charming couple. #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Has the idiocy in Oregon continued where non whites don’t have to wear masks?  I take it that it’s ok if minorities catch COVID... as long as we don’t offend anyone their life doesn’t matter. #COVID19 #Oregon #Idiocracy #LivesMatter #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Have you noticed that all the younger people will wear a mask. It’s the older folks that are big ass crybabies?! We are trying to save your life Grandma! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Have you noticed that many countries in Asia have seen a sharp decrease in COVID cases? Wild thought, but I think the fact that they always wear masks to stop the spread of diseases anyway might be why  But sure, let's keep calling it "kung flu" in the USA #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Here's the hard-boiled truth: there will not be a second #Covid19 lock down, no matter what the numbers are, because the system we have cannot survive it. We are on our own. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey @GovRonDeSantis, Marco Rubio & Rick Scott advise wearing a mask. Do you even care that ICUs are becoming overrun & your citizens are getting sicker, that other states don’t want Floridians entering without quarantining?That FL is an object of scorn? Do you? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey @Walmart  my wife and I shop at your Troy Missouri store. 7am every Wednesday. Impressed with employees consistent wearing of masks, confused by independent vendors stocking product on shelf not wearing masks?   Why?  Kind of a wash, don’t you think?  #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey @Walmart I was at store #1103 in Houston and there were at least 24 people in the store without masks. No one was even checking. #COVID__19 #covidtexas #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey Guy,  Safety comes in a mask you dolt. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey fellow Americans! 121,279 of us are dead from #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey guys, just asking, you think it’s safe to not wear a mask when there is no one in the park’s running trail? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey idiots! If you want to go to the movies and not kill people, wear your masks! Unless everyone wants to go back to lockdown! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hey y'all! You do it for everyone ELSE you might get sick. Give a Fuck. Wear a Mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hi Martina, I guess she knows someone who chocked on a mask trying to eat it?  Otherwise can't understand how masks are killing people.  #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hi we just hit a new record of confirmed cases, please wear your fucking mask. It’s not that hard, safe a life. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hong Kong rent could be waived for two months to ease impact of 10 per cent rise for public housing tenants? The eldest son of Parmanand D Hinduja, Srichand, 84, is the head of Hinduja Family and Chairman of Hinduja Group and charitable foundations #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Hope things improve very soon for you Victoria&more people would understand&respect your admonitions about not wearing #Masks.It is INCREDIBLE with all the clear scientific evidence masks can PREVENT much transmission & infection&yet people are STILL not doing it #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Hope you didn't take any government funding since you're enthralled by personal responsibility.  The hypocrisy would be real...#covid19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	How about Trump NOT close testing sites but IMPROVE testing so we can beat this?   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	How did America ever pass seatbelt laws, legal drinking age laws, no smoking zones laws??  All laws that respect the health of yourself and others. Were all these "I won't wear a  mask so I can be free" idiots not around then???   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	How did ‘wear a mask as it helps protect others’ become a debate #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	How do you...  Take the florida woman seriously?   Yo am I going to die because of my mask guys?   #howdoyou #floridawoman #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	I WILL NEVER WEAR A MASK.  PERIOD.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I aint wearin no damn mask bcuz I aint got no damn virus but feel free to mask up your diseased self all you want! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I am confused. How are people even the least bit surprised that more  athletes (and people in general) are testing positive for #COVID19? Has your head been in the sand for 5 months? If so, why take it out now...? #itsapandemicpeople #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I am expected to wear a mask through child labor, my trauma nurse husband wears a full face respirator for a 12-hour shift....#WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I am rage tweeking wear a mask.. I am so furious with this idiots who keep saying "take your life back" "don't be weak" "98% survival rate" "I am a free person"... all these glorified excuses just to avoid a piece of cloth on ur face! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I asked an acquaintance if there's a death toll number that would justify mandating masks in public.  I was told, "Kian, don't be a sheep.  The numbers are made up."  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I attended an outdoor committee meeting re: a city project and all of us were exposed to #COVID19.  People in charge:  don't call an in-person meeting.  It's not worth it.  #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I beg of you if you have any sense wear a mask! I don’t care if he doesn’t want to wear one.  Save yourselves, your family and friends. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	I can normally see other political views and why people think what they do but I can not understand at all why people are protesting masks. It shouldn’t be political. People are dying. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I could wear a mask more. @JReinerMD nailed it: Not wearing a mask is like driving drunk. You might not kill yourself but you can still killl someone else.  I’m wearing a mask, period. These are the voices we need to listen to #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I did...  And it was at least 107° in #Tucson today   - so anyone outside the southwest can kiss my a** if they aren't wearing a mask "because it is too hot"  #WearAMask #Arizona #coronavirus #masks
20200625	1	I didn't have quoting @marcorubio on my 2020 Bingo card but "Everyone should just wear a damn mask." Reminder that masks are NOT political. Masks are to protect others. If everyone wears one, you'll be protected from their germs. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I didn’t really anticipate having to make the decision on whether or not to homeschool my asthmatic children during a pandemic because people don’t have the basic decency to protect each other and wear a fucking mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I don't care how stupid I look running around in a mask. I've got enough crap going on. It's not worth the risk. Wear a stupid ass mask idiots  #mask #COVID19 #coronavirus #masks #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I don't care if you wear a blue mask or a red mask.  Just wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I don't know who needs to hear this but @QuickChek has 3-packs of masks for $5.99. Don't tell me you can't find any. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I don't know why, but the only people I see not wearing a mask at the store are at risk people.  To all those older people who think they know best, listen to the experts and #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I don't understand why Trump Supporters refuse to wear a mask.    The KKK wears 'em all the time.  #thursdaymorning #ThursdayMotivation #thursdayvibes #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	I don't want to wear a mask. But if there is even a miniscule chance that 1 person won't die, then I'm going wear a fucking mask. My minor inconvenience is not worth someone's life.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I dont get the outrage getting a new mask should be like clothes shopping just get something u like and wear it. Thats how it is now just do it damn!  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I got about 10 masks in different colors and patterns. Even one with rhinestones. Gotta go with the outfits. You can still be cute with yo mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have Gastroparesis + Gastric Crohns = Zero Immune System. I had a stroke at 33. I've had 4 TIA's. Wear a fucking mask. My life depends on it. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have anxiety, wearing a mask aggravates my condition. I wear it anyway.                #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have been wearing a mask for a few months now, when I go for walks, hikes, into stores...it's not that hard, it is just different.  It's why Massachusetts has the lowest rate of transmission of COVID today.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have no problem wearing my N95 mask when I am going into a retail store or going into a crowded building, but I think it is a little ridiculous to wear a mask while walking in my neighborhood.#WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have sat for hours in my own damn house with a mask on to break myself of the anxiety of having my face covered. Why? Because I care more about others than my own personal comfort. It's really that simple, kids. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have seasonal allergies and breathing is sometimes hard underneath the mask. I still wear it.  I tend to get panic attacks sometimes, it’s even worse with the mask on. I still wear it.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I have to wear a mask up to 9 hours a day. I work at a hospital and it isn't optional. Of course it's uncomfortable. But we do it for our health and the safety of others around us. You can wear a mask during your 20min grocery run, I promise it won't kill you. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	I have “Trump is Patient Zero” on my #pandemic bingo card. #TrumpVirus #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I haven't wore a mask and I'm fine #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I haven’t left the house.  When I leave the house, I do wear a mask.  My mama made me several #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I hope the people who are against social distancing and wearing masks because "muh freedoms" realize that if it gets so bad that the US Military can no longer train or function cohesively...  They will begin forcibly detaining and placing people in camps.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I just drove from So Cal to Chicago and back.  North route there and south route back.   Most of the time I was the ONLY mask wearer.  @FairfieldHotels forced me into a suite and higher price because they only do 50% capacity, yet the desk worker wore no mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I kindly request you remove your MAGA hat and put on your human kindness hat.   More testing and #’s going down is our goal. Testing allows us to quarantine individ who are spreading COVID, most unknowingly.  A mask isn’t a form of oppression but a symbol of love.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I know a lot of you hate wearing masks. I get it. My N-95 mask tends to irritate my skin, & I work with it 9 hours/day, 40+ hours/week. But I'd rather deal with skin irritation than fucking die. To all of you not paying the same respect and wearing one? Fuck you. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I know at least 5 in our small rural town, pop. 8000.  Our community has seen 80+ cases, or about 1%.  Mind you, those are only lab confirmed cases.  I suspect there are 5-10 times that didn't receive testing. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I know that people are tired of the words “pandemic”, COVID-19, unprecedented - but it is OUR truth.  Our own @BlueJays and staff in hard-hit Florida are a good example of why Canadians need to be cautious. @fordnation @celliottability Make masks mandatory! #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	I live in Queens, NY. Not only do I wear a mask everywhere, but I also use a face shield in stores. After hearing ambulances day and night for two months and knowing many who died of all ages, no politician has to convince me to be safe and considerate.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I live in a city that’s had lots of BLM “protests”....So apperantly I’m all good and don’t need a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I looked carefully at the picture because we always say that after we realize someone was a killer that they looked so normal. These super spreaders are #COVID19 spreaders who will gladly harm others. #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	I love @kumandgo and everything they do but man how do they not mandate their employees wear masks?  That’s crazy. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I love that now Hillsborough has the mandatory masks because I can now legally argue with customers about dumb they are for not wearing masks! Had my first argument with some lady in the cafe and I’m living my best life  #Hillsborough #Quarantine #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	I mean who tha fuck doesn't wanna look like a ninja?! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I need one of these "I'm not going to wear a mask" idiots to explain how healthcare workers wear masks 12+ hours a day with no ill effects. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I notice lotsa MAGA ppl are anti-mask. Do they realize the American era they idolize DRAFTED ppl to go to WAR? Yet in 2020 they're livid at the govt for requiring a piece of cloth on faces. See it as bare minimum National duty?? Or should we call them #MaskDodgers? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I see everyone today is an epidemiologist.  #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I suffer from serious Sensory Processing Disorder. Wearing a mask aggravates it, often to a debilitating level. Having to wear one just to go out at the beginning of this was something out of my nightmares & I had many anxiety attacks.  I STILL WORE IT & STILL DO  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I think at this point doctors and staff should just turn ppl away for treatment. If you are not wearing a mask, and you don't care about others, you are just a murderer. It's not ethically correct, but we are living in crazy times. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I think the most sad and shocking thing about this entire pandemic is how many people in the US would rather watch hundreds of thousands of people die a painful death than have the “inconvenience” of personally wearing a face mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I wandered into @Walmart yesterday because I need some items cheap.  I just can’t anymore. Maybe 1/2 were wearing masks.  1/4 had a mask down around their chin.   If you don’t care about my life, f*ck you.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I want a face mask that makes me look like a young Harrison Ford. #facemask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I want an unencumbered oropharynx, so I wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I wear a mask for others.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I wear a mask to cover my ugly face . . . . . You should too   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I will never get the mindset of people refusing to wear a mask.  They wil never understand until they or someone they love gets COVID19. I hate that it has to come to that. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I will not wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I wish people would stop inviting children on sleepovers. I’ve had three invites for my kids over the last two weeks.   #COVID19ireland #COVID19 #coronavirus #PhysicalDistancing #SocialDistancing #2m #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	I work an an Insulator in Construction sites. To work with insulation I HAVE to wear a mask. I have asthma. I have zero problem wearing a mask all day. Don't be the "I have a medical condition that doesn't allow me to wear a mask" ass bitch.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I work in retail here in California where masks are REQUIRED. The amount of Karen's offended by me asking if the have a mask to enter the store is astounding! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I'm in Sierra Vista also known as sorry vista  nobody knows about us but that's okay bc at the rate my town isn't wearing masks everyone might be dead soon. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I'm perfecting the skill of giving my best disparaging look to Karens not wearing masks from behind my mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I'm so sorry that wearing masks has become a political tool. I am so sorry we encourage meanness, disrespect for science, and a sense of unearned entitlement as modelled in our White House. I hope you have strong support and help as you recover. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I'm worried about the every day workers in @Publix and other service industry businesses along with restaurants inching out sustainable livings... Now they have to deal with Trump's #COVIDIOT Army. He is why they exist.   I'll assist any worker having a tough time. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I've been wearing a mask for hours on end and I can breathe just fine. What are these people, wussies? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I've said this before. I don't care how many of them die (this is what the last 4 years have done to this #empath #healthcareworker), I care what they will do to our doctors and nurses and respiratory techs. #COVID19 KILLS. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I've watched AZ and CO closely..CO stressed mask wearing and their numbers are under 200 daily. No one in AZ wears masks and we are breaking records. Stupidity fucked us. Listen to science and #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	IF PROTESTERS CAN WEAR MASKS WHILE GETTING SHOT BY RUBBER BULLETS AND TEAR GAS YOU CAN WEAR A MASK WHEN YOU GO TO THE STORE.  USE YOUR BRAIN. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If Covid-19 only targeted and killed idiots, the world would be a much better place #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If Dr. Fauci was a US President I bet every americans will be wearing masks #DrFauci #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If I can wear a mask for 10+ hours at work, including checking in vendors in 90+ degree weather while keeping my mask on, I think you can handle wearing one for 20 min in the grocery store #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If I see someone outside without a mask I’m going to flip out. MY GRANDMA CANNOT BREATHE WITHOUT OXYGEN. Please. Protect your loved ones, have compassion for other life. Stop being assholes. Please. #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	If I see you without your mask on in public I am assuming that you have weak genes and natural selection will take care of you. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If I’ve learned anything from watching @EllenPompeo on @GreysABC for 16 seasons, it’s how to flirt with your eyes while wearing a face mask !  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If Mad Dog Mattis say wear a mask, you wear fucking mask. #MadDog #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If anyone asks why America has the worst pandemic response, the answer is Trump and these nuts that he enables. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If everyone had worn a mask when this began we would have the country open now with very little cases if any... whichever party you believe in, you would now be with friends, family and little to no masks at all #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If nothing else, don't #antimaskers understand the economic impact of increased #COVID19 infections and deaths? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you are having trouble breathing in a mask, try different types. I went thru 4 different types before I found one that is comfortable for me. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you are reading this and you are not willing to wear a mask, I do not want to be associated with you.    Do one of the following;  ∙ Block me  or  ∙ Unfollow me, then DM me, so I can return the favor  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	If you can afford $400 for a pair of cowboy boots and $200 for a cowboy hat? You can afford a $50 designer N95 mask that’s comfortable to wear and breathe!   Remember! real cowboys (and cowgirls) wore masks!  A mask is not a political statement. It's an IQ test.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you can't breathe with a mask on, Imagine How #GeorgFloyd felt with a knee on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds!   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you don't want to wear a mask, wear it anyway. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you don’t like wearing a mask you certainly won’t like wearing a ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you don’t wear a mask, your selfish. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you don’t wear a mask, you’re a moron. That’s it. Bottom line. You’re a God damn moron.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you feel #BlackLivesMatter -Then wear a mask for them. If #BlueLivesMatter is more your speed, then yep! They’re going to need you to wear a mask too. And if #AllLivesMatter is your cup of tea?... well then you sure as fuck better be wearing ALL the masks! Just #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you feel you’re not getting proper oxygen while wearing a mask, its either because your mask wasn’t well made or it’s a psychological response to fear/anxiety/claustrophobia.   You are not gonna die from wearing a mask for 40 minutes in the grocery store. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you go out in public, there is only one piece of clothing I expect you to wear: a mask. Other than that, I don’t really care too much. Seriously, a mask and nothing else? Fine. It’s summer. Just wear the damn mask.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you really believe that wearing a mask is unhealthy, why aren’t people in hospitals that wear them for much longer than your trip to the store dropping like flies? How about skiers, or fire fighters? Or painters? Come on people! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you still believe you don't need to wear a mask, please watch the last episode of #LenoxHill to witness the manifestation your selfishness has on doctors and nurses throughout the nation And you know who needs to go to hell as quickly as possible #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you want to continue to enjoy the freedoms of opening back up, wear a mask! It is clear people should be wearing masks while out in public. Masks are a likely reason why the virus has been better controlled in China, South Korea, Japan, and other countries  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you want to see the stock market go up and the economy recover, mandate masks! People feel safe when we're ALL wearing masks! @realDonaldTrump #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	If you want yourself and your loved ones to not contract the #Coronavirus and CONTINUE to breathe, wear a #mask. #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	If you would wear a seat belt or use a car seat for your child wear a mask. If you would wear a condom with a new partner then wear a mask. If you are afraid of a mask you won’t survive on a ventilator. Wear a mask!!!!!!#WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If your politics involve rejecting mask wearing in the name of ‘freedom’ and ‘liberty,’ I’ve got news for you - you’re not political; you’re just claiming to be political in order to justify being a selfish, ignorant asshole. #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you’re anti-mask wearing I hope your hypocritical ass is pro-choice for women. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you’re brave enough to wear a @Cubs or @GreenbaypackNFL jersey, wearing a mask can only help your image. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	If you’re not wearing a mask in public, you’re an asshole. And I prejudge you as an asshole. I also assume you align with Trump. Because that’s where we are.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Ignorant dudes out here be like "the coronavirus is a conspiracy, ain't nobody got that shit"   By that logic since I don't know anyone who has hepatitis C, it doesn't exist.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Ima start swinging on people I see who aren’t wearing a mask! How hard is it?!? Fucking understand you dumb bitch. You’re moms a hoe if you don’t wear a damn mask! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Imagine having the audacity to go into a public space without a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Imagine if you were on a ventilator. A mask is far less intrusive. Visit a hospital and see what is done to severe Covid cases. If you have half a brain you might change your tune. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Instead of Dexamethasone, trial should be of Tadalfil  This fast acting drug has effect both on Lungs and Platelets, a must for #Covid_19 .  Predetermined mind set about any drug, like anti Malarial or ED won't work with #COVID19  Cure not method counts  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It honestly blows my mind that something as simple as wearing a mask is a political issue  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It takes more energy to argue about not wanting to wear a mask than to just put one on. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It turns out that the coronavirus doesn't listen to Orwellian Fake News speak.  Wow, who'd have thought that?  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It's nice to know if I come in contact with a Covid carrier and I'm wearing a mask there's still a 70% chance I'll get it  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It's required one wears a shirt and shoes before entering most establishments so why make an ass of yourself and not wear a face mask? I don't see y'all out there topless and barefoot walking through Meijer or other stores. Show some respect.#MaskUpMichigan #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It's weakness. They are afraid of the #bullyinchief and the #covidiots in their states. A few whiny, selfish, vain constituents are making the life or death decisions for all of us.  It's obscene. @dougducey is a moron. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s Opposite Day. New York imposing quarantine on travelers from covid hot states. Europe is instituting an “American Ban”. #NewYorkTough #COVID19 #Phase4 #DeSantisFailedFlorida #TrumpResignNow #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s fascinating how people watch the same stuff and hear 2 totally different things. @JoeBrunoWSOC9 great question/horrible question. @NC_Governor kudos on the masks/how dare you tell me what to do with my body when I vote to tell women what to do with theirs?!#WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s funny how the people who don’t want to wear masks are all “MY BODY MY CHOICE!” until it comes to a woman’s right to have an abortion  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s like the governor said, wearing a mask doesn’t hurt the economy, it helps it.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s not a mandatory law that you have to wear a mask anywhere outside of your home. Governors can make official orders, but it’s not a LAW #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s not hard to carry around a mask in your car any store you go to might have signs forbidding entry without mask so just carry one at all times I hate wearing those fucking things and I don’t believe in it but I’ll still do it if it means helping someone #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s positively surreal that there’s even disagreement about mask wearing. And even more bizarre that the division is across political lines. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s really simply logic. You wear a mask for the sake of others. Not yourself. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s somewhat ironic, isn’t it, that so many mask-ridiculing people use the admonition “sheep”? #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	It’s the same people complaining about the economy that aren’t wearing the masks! No masks and also want everything open. I don’t get it. Look at other countries that are open people.. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	It’s weird how a bunch of grown ass adults are complaining about wearing a face mask for their protection. Fine, then if not your protect then for everyone else. Protection from the virus, your bad teeth, crooked smile, and horrible breath. Protect the air. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I’m so sick of everyone thinking this virus is a hoax due to this wretched President. Have respect for people around you and wear one and stop  bitching about your god damned rights. So fucking selfish #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	I’ve been thanked by patients in the past finding the cause of their pain, fixing a laceration well, delivering a baby, rare life saving. Now ppl thank me for putting my life at risk for them.   I’m here to thank all the mask wearers   Be a healthcare hero #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	I’ve got zero patience for the anti-vax, anti-mask mommy brigade. Fuck those putas. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Jake Gyllenhaal's character telling people not to go outdoors in #TheDayAfterTomorrow (yes, I'm watching AMC) is the modern equivalent of telling idiots to wear masks. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Jerry Nadler represents the 2020 Democrats. Weak, incompetent, mask wearing pussy liberals. Jim Jordan should whisper in Nadler's ear, real men don't wear masks. @RepJerryNadler #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just a friendly reminder to wear a fucking mask. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just because @POTUS doesn’t wear a mask doesn’t mean the rest of us shouldn’t. He can tested any time he wants and anyone he sees gets tested before they see him. The people turning this into a political issue are sycophants & people who are selfish. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just because places are reopening and there are few cases doesn’t mean you don’t have to wear a mask! *cough* *cough* Florida *cough* *cough*  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just curious, what’s #georgebush thinking about these days. Maybe time to speak up? #racism #Trump #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice #presidentbush #BlackLivesMatter #Equality #COVID19 #COVID__19 #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Just heard medical analyst on CNN say NOT WEARING A MASK IS EQUIVALENT TO DRIVING DRUNK!  This says it all!  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just in case anyone is ever wondering: Regardless if you are my friend, or not, if you go out in public without a mask on your face--I am hella judging you. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just in case anyone was confused, more testing doesn’t lead to more cases.  Cases exist whether or not people get tested.  What testing actually prevents is unnecessary death.  #TrumpIsKillingUs #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just overhead people say this;  “Those people aren’t wearing a mask!  Why do I have to?”  And that was from a full grown adult.  Doesn’t this sound like; “those kids aren’t wearing coats!  Why do I have to, mommy?”  Grow up people and wear your masks.  #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Just saw a guy in a forest camo jacket with no mask at the supermarket. Fucker’s ignoring a global pandemic but is apparently scared of getting jumped by a bear in the canned-goods aisle. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just wear a freaking mask people or stay home, your choice #pandemic #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Just witnessed my first boomer complaining to a grocery store employee about he is sick and tired of being forced to wear a mask. I swear, grocery/restaurant/bar employees have more patience than almost anyone. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Kinda late for this ruling.  We seniors have been in MORE serious danger due to #MAGAts who don't give a damn about anyone but themselves and have flaunted not wearing masks.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Ladies, think of your mask like a bra... Wear it out of the house because you have to, and fling that shit into the corner as you walk back in the door.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Last night I decided to alter my contoured #mask pattern. OMGee what a huge difference! So excited to make more...  #Masks #MasksSaveLives #COVID19 #WearAMaskWA #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200625	1	Let’s take all the people that don’t want to wear masks and send them to Florida. We’ll wall up the border and @realDonaldTrump can rule them as a dictator from Mar-a-Lago til they all dead. We’ll also record it and watch it like a reality show #floridacovid #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Listening to reports of the effectiveness of masks in stopping transmission of corona virus - and the idiocy of those who feel it’s their “right” to not wear them - says she feels her “inner Karen” coming out.  Wow. She has always been an anti-Karen. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Literally in FB Groups with people still asking if they should wear a mask....UMM Do you believe in science?? Wear a goddamn mask! GOOD LORD!  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Look none of us like wearing a mask. If it helps us get back to normal quicker, I will do my part. This is coming from someone who wears glasses that fog up every breath I take! #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Mask it or Casket? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Mask wearing creates Herd Immunity #WearADamnMask:   2,390,000 (USA cases) ÷ 300,000,000 (USA Population) = .007966  Move the decimal place over by 2 for the percentage aaaaand, FUCK.   ONLY .79% OF THE USA POPULATION HAS BEEN INFECTED.  #WearADamnMask #COVID__19 #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Masks prevent you from spreading or getting COVID-19. If you don't care about other people's well being then at least care about your own. If you catch COVID-19 and die, that's your own fault. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Maybe we tell the #GovernmentOverreach crowd that a mask and a pair of sunglasses basically makes it impossible for facial recognition software to do its job? Is that a conspiracy theory they would get behind? #MaskUpUtah #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Me too @MagaMexico! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	My SIL and I agree that if we could stay home and never leave our houses again, we’d be perfectly fine. Just wish I could get groceries delivered here! Too far out in the country right now. Maybe after we move. #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	My dad is one of those people. Can't stand it. Pisses me off with his "let's drive an hour away to a grocery store that doesn't require masks" bullshit.  For the love of god just suck it up and #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	No rally in ME-just ruined full days’ output PPE by not a wearing mask-After governor told him NOT to come-wasn’t allowed to land in Portland. Yesterday was church in AZ. I think those were only 2 rallies so far. We’re doing good & won’t let him wreck it! #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	No you do some research. They protect OTHERS by keeping YOUR respiratory droplets (or sneezes/coughs) inside YOUR mask, instead of headed toward ME. I’m 67 years old and would like to live out my whole lifespan, do my art and law work. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	No. With 0,25% 1 million citizens would be dead within one year, about 20 million would be released from 2-4 week stay in hospital after a serious treatment. BUT hospitals cannot cope with this number, an extra 5 million  people will die. Check Bergamo.  #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Not wearing a mask is same as driving drunk #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Of the four California counties "losing the battle," three of them are predominantly "don't tread on me" and the other is "vaccines are bad." Are we surprised? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Ok, so if you exhale/cough, respiratory droplets fly out. If you wear a mask, they fly less feets yo. You don't know if you're sick, even if you do know,  you don't. So wear a damn mask to fly less feets. This feels duh. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	On a roadtrip and walked into a gas station where NO ONE was wearing a mask. I was appalled and, honestly, disgusted. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	One of the things that absolutely boggles my mind is how all these governors politicizing covid and mask wearing, aren't stupid people.  Surely they could see things would eventually go haywire. It wasn't a plot twist by the universe.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Over 100k deaths & folks refuse to wear masks. Despite an HIV/AIDS epidemic &  the fear of unwanted pregnancy, some folks still refuse to wear condoms. Probably the same folks, too. Should we really be surprised? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	PLEASE stop using autism as an excuse to not wear a face mask. I’m autistic. I HATE masks. I keep trips out short to avoid wearing them. But I wear one when I go out, to keep others safe. If I can’t make myself wear one on certain days, I don’t go out. Period.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Patient #754: “these masks are awful, I can’t breathe” looks at me and says “you poor thing wearing that all day”. Me: “meh, it’s probably more comfortable than a ventilator”  #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	People have a choice to not wear a mask, we should not force people to wear a mask because they dont want too. If your too scared your going to get sick, man up and wear a mask. But dont get butt hurt when someone else chooses not to wear one. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	People in Nevada are getting all kinds of mad about wearing a mask! You don’t have to wear a mask. You just also can not go into a building. Just like you don’t have to wear shoes, but again ... you know! You still have choices! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	People keep refusing to wear a mask and to follow the recommended health guidelines and I wanna cry.   WEAR your DAMN mask, so you can save lives. So you can save our lives!  #NEISvoid #HighRiskCovid19 #MaskUp #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Phillippians 2:4 "Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too."  If any of you are Christians, you do not have an argument against wearing masks. #Christianswearmasks #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Ppl who want to make wearing a mask political have Trump on the brain, and are insane! It’s a public health issue. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Precisely because it's not compulsory - leaders lead by example. Masks reduce the probability of transmission. #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Pro tip If the mask pulls on your ears, wear headphones! It’ll flatten them out! #lookingoutforyou #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Put your children in car seats cuz it is the law but also it keeps them safe. Wear a mask to keep our kids safe. This isn't just for older folks.  #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Right, I'm sorry, but how stupid do you have to be to not know how to wear a mask? Do you need a graphic? A slideshow on how to put it on? You're putting on a mask, not trying to build a time machine. #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Sheer nonsense. Wake up and do a little research. That carbon dioxide propaganda is not true. You are being very selfish and encouraging dangerous behavior. I'm a nurse and have been wearing masks for YEARS to protect myself and my patients. And I'm alive!!!  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Silly me. I thought I'd get some time off in August because people would wear masks and transmission rates would go down #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	So #coronavirus  cases are spiking (again) in the US, some states are back on the exponential curve, and what is twitter up in arms about? Whether voice actors should voice characters of different races.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	So I've finally resorted to the only rational response to people not wearing masks near me - I pretend they do not exist.Curiously, this seems to actually bother them, though they already made their intention known to me that they do not care about my health.#MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	So ignorant! A mask helps to keep YOUR germs out of the face of others. It does very little to protect you from other people’s germs. But if we all wear them, there won’t be as many germs floating around in the air. Get it?? This is the shit that makes me so angry! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	So many folks not wearing their mask.  Hope IL is not going to start trending backwards.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	So now, if you wear a mask you're a Trump hater. When in reality you're showing your respect and concern for others. #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	So the man says “I don’t feel like wearing a condom.”  She says “What if I get pregnant?” He replies “Not my problem.” Yeah, it’s like that. Wear your damn mask! #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	So the weather wants us to wear masks this weekend too!   #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	So your feelings lead you to want to increase your chance of spreading a deadly virus???  You can't breathe with a mask??? You WONT be able to breathe if you catch #coronavirus  This isn't about you. It's about everyone else.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Some psychotic cultist Florida Woman is accusing doctors of crimes against humanity for mandating masks.  Shut up. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Sorry, what was that? Oh, you don't want to wear a mask? You want to be an asshole and spread covid-19 and kill people? I also hope you get your shit slapped as well!   #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Starting today, people in Marion and Polk counties will be required to wear a face mask when they are in public, indoor spaces. This mandate comes in an attempt to prevent the spread of #COVID19. #Coronavirus #oregon #salemoregon #OR #SalemOR #clypiancoverage #masks
20200625	1	Stayed at @FairfieldHotels in New Mexico this week and was forced into a suite because they were only allowed to fill to 50% capacity.  I can understand that, but having to pay for a suite because of COVID and then the hotel staff can't be bothered to wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Still too soon to declare victory. Sure, many protesters wore masks, but many didn't. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Still waiting for reports of mask related deaths from surgeons and healthcare professionals who wear a mask on a regular basis..... #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Stop being selfish wear a mask to protect others and think about your families and elderly especially. It’s too late when your sick  or have infected others . Stay safe and stay alive .   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Studies have shown the world over that protests didn’t cause a spike because the majority of ppl wore masks. In Toronto masks were handed out as you arrived at the gathering spots. #StayTheFHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Such snowflakes.  Does he want his surgeon to breath more easily by not wearing a mask too? I would think not.  #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Sweet, so what are the numbers on those #trumpvirus cases then? How are those going, Mr. "If I don't see it, it doesn't exist"?   #TrumpIsKillingUs #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Take them on a tour- no masks allowed!!! Let them catch it and then deal with the healthcare system on their own. Your wife is amazing for her selflessness and I wish you all the best!! #MasksSaveLives

20200625	1	Texas and Florida conservatives acting like everything is alright, while simultaneously gaining more cases per day than should have ever have been acceptable... WEAR YOUR MASK, SOCIAL DISTANCE, AND WASH YOUR HANDS!  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Thank you @NC_Governor Cooper for making masks mandatory in public places. Decreasing the spread of #COVID19  and continuing economic activity are not mutually exclusive. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Thank you Niamh,  well said.  The more of us that mask in public places for the next few months the quicker we will overcome this virus and get back to normal #MasksSaveLives

20200625	1	The Corona  virus is not over #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The US holds just 4.5% of the world’s population yet we have 25% of the coronavirus cases on the planet.  Wearing a face mask isn’t a political issue. It’s literally a life or death issue.  Get your shit together and stop being so fkn selfish.  #COVID #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The US sets a new record for new #COVID19 cases in a day...39,101 & still counting  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The United States saw 36 THOUSAND new cases today alone. 36,000. Wear your fucking masks people. Stop listening to habitual liars and conmen and start listening to scientists #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The fact that Americans won’t wear masks is the exact reason we are where we are in the US.    The world is again shaking their heads at us wondering why we cannot make a small sacrifice for others.     #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The full impact of America's failure to contain the #coronavirus coronavirus will be felt this fall when schools close and fall sports are canceled.   #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	The leader of the free world has declared wearing masks is for losers and liberals.  Why do you expect them to disagree?  'K' said a large die-off will help stock market.  Are you not following the play book? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The mask thing seems to be an issue for Irish people. It's as easy as popping in your headphones. How can a nation who combines jeans and dress shoes be self-conscious about a mask? #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The same people complaining about a mask probably don’t even wash their hands like they’re supposed to either. We see you. There’s no I in team, but there’s an all about me for those who force it  #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	The same people screaming “I’m NOT wearing a mask!”, will be the first ones to start a go fund me when their family dies from covid. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	There area so many plus to wearing a mask! Not only will you not get covid or other colds bit you won't be recognized by most facial recognition software. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	There is no covid surge from any demo. Masks masks masks work.  Wear a mask. Get it on.  #covid19 #getiton #masks
20200625	1	There is no medical reason not to wear a face mask. But if it makes you feel uncomfortable (I can relate to this) you can always wear the face shields. They are less claustrophobic and do the same job. No excuse for not wearing a face covering of some kind. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	There's 2,464,551 infected w/the coronavirus and 124,331 dead and the numbers are steadily rising  Wearing a mask shouldn't be a fucking issue  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	This is why travel restrictions will be imposed on the US by the EU.  I know high school kids that could have organized a better Covid-19 response.  This virus is peaking again because this administration did not implement proper safety guidelines.   #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	This isn't even worth anyone's time. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpVirus #ScienceMatters #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	This isn’t about politics. If you wear a mask, you’re protecting others more than yourself. Stop being selfish.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Those who throwing toddler fits about masks.. think about it this way, don't wear a mask, shut down the economy again, for longer.... #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Time for brands to start asking their influencers and bloggers to wear masks when they go places to make promotional posts. Enough with retail and food employees being put at extreme risk for your profit. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	To everyone who doesn't wear a mask, I got two words for you "FUCK YOU."  Have a heart and save a life #WearAMask. #WearTheDamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Today I had to grab a bottle of water in a gas station. No one was wearing a mask. Had to ask someone to back off 6 ft away.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Today I heard the best response ever from a doctor being interviewed- “If you don’t like wearing a mask, you’ll hate wearing a ventilator”. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Today, I wish the entire South would secede from the Union. I will gladly carry a passport to travel there. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Trump really needs to embrace mail-in ballots, because a ton of his supporters who refuse to wear masks will be quarantined by election day.  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Trump will protect statues of his racist heroes but still refuses to protect Americans. He could STILL do a national  lockdown to flatten state curves but he sees no value in saving American lives.  #AmericaOrTrump #TrumpDeathToll123K @realDonaldTrump #Covid_19 #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	U.S. hits highest single day of #COVID19 cases at 36,358, breaking April record. POTUS cuts funding for testing, a day after his #SuperSpreader in Phoenix. Why does he want to kill Americans? #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteOutTheGOP #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	UPDATE: My aunt pulled through. 4 1/2 weeks on a ventilator means her muscles are atrophied so bad that she can’t use her hands now and is in a nursing home until she regains strength. Her son (my cousin) was not so lucky.  #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	WEAR A DAMN MASK YOU ARE KILLING OLDER PPL AND PPL WITH UNDERLYING PROBLEMS. But I guess @realDonaldTrump doesn’t wear one it’s ok right? #idiots #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	WEAR A DAMN MASK. It’s not like we’re asking these idiots to carry 30+ pounds of body armour, don’t sleep and shower for days, be away from family, get blown up, be on death alert for 24/7... It’s a mask! Y’all got it. #TrumpVirus #COVID19 #DeSantisBetrayedFlorida #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	WRONG!!  I am in the field and we disinfect them every day before and after shift along with face shields etc.  you don’t know what you are talking about. #Shame on you.  #Liar  selfish people don’t wear masks. #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	We are as dividing on testing as the country is now politically, but wearing a mask right now is like putting on your seatbelt in the car. It’s  precautionary safety move. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	We have gained over a quarter million new cases since Friday.  #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We mourn, but we're more terrified of mean Tweets from Trump or federal funding cuts, so we're not actually going to do anything useful, but maybe just encourage you to wear a mask, not a mandate like we actually need to save lives. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We need the airwaves filled with PSAs from celebs, athletes, CEOs, Biden, Obama, writers, Instagram influencers telling people that wearing a mask saves lives. All social media should be dominated by this message. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We now know a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic) and can still transmit the virus to others. Forget your political statement and think of the health of your community #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We really lost Joe Diffie to COVID-19 and I think we’re all forgetting that. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We shouldn't be 'opening' anything ... anywhere ... if you aren't willing to wear a mask. Are we really at the sad place in American history where we willingly allow people to die because of selfishness/willfulness/laziness?  Awful deaths. Lonely deaths. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We think we need to avoid those without masks so we don't get sick. We need to avoid them because they are likely trump supporters.    #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	We're now risking another lockdown or more mass death because some of y'all were too selfish to think of your fellow Americans. Wear your damn masks, stand more than 6 feet apart, socially distance. Be a patriot. Your selfishness is ruining it for the rest of us. #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	We've been wearing ours since 3rd week of Feb #ThursdayThoughts #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200625	1	Wear a Mask. #COVID19 is real. It’s no joke. Proud to say 3 of us are recovering after fighting hard the last 3 weeks while battling lots of peaks & valleys along the way. My wife is high risk with an autoimmune disease & fought off pneumonia and hospitalization #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Wearing a mask isn't political It's just common sense during a pandemic  #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Wearing a mask isn’t about protecting yourself, it’s about protecting others from you. Anyone could be infected or an asymptomatic carrier, and refusing to wear a mask demonstrates a complete disregard for the health and safety of others. #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	With the majority of Michigan reopened, I'm seeing a fraction of masks on & barely any social distancing. Bars packed, restaurants  near full, etc. Three months & y'all just give up; like a new years resolution. Unreal.  #MaskUpMichigan #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Yea this virus is all just a hoax... shut down the entire world and all of their economies..... just to get back at trump and make you wear a mask.   (If you believe this, you’re stupid!)  #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Yep. Nevada here and we started seeing a spike almost immediately after reopening the casinos. Governor just ordered everyone to wear face masks for which I am thankful, because like it or not we do need the casinos. But now they have to #WearADamnMask

20200625	1	Yes, you walked into @Walgreens #Rocklin without a mask and no one said anything. But I was silently judging you. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Yes. "Wearing masks and handwashing" turns out is the best one can do to prevent virus spread. So it will protect the gains we made with the (to some very painful) lockdown. It will allow us to open up more businesses, activities, events.  It is just temporarily. #WearADamnMask
20200625	1	Yet NY cases continue to fall as we reopen, and delay theatres, gyms, amusement parks & sports events.  Many @NYGovCuomo is doing it the right way?  Treat #COVID19 as public health, not politics as usual.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200625	1	Yo, wear your fucking mask in public.  Best case is that you could save someone's life.  Worst case, it's a minor inconvenience to your comfort.  Show some compassion and empathy for others.  It's not political. Just fucking do it.  #WearADamnMask

20200626	1	Dear Coronavirus Taskforce,   Please tell us the truth.   No fluff and soft edges.  If the truth is scary, scare us.   We can take it, and many people need a truth-kick in the pants.  Please and Thank You,  Americans against covid19   #msnbc #cnn #fox #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Didn’t you just say the US needS to back off on testing so there aren’t as many cases (because that’s totally logical...)?  #geniusatwork #sciencematters #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Doctors speaking: Masks are not a political issue Masks are a public health issue #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Don't wear my glasses when I wear my mask walking outside cause it gets in the way.   I may or may not have just been whisper-talking sweet nothings to a black potted plant I thought was a cat.   The price of safety is sometimes our sanity. Fair trade.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Donald, you’re like a scared little child. Dude, this collapse of America is all on you and Fox News. Even as NY was crumbling from COVID19, y’all ignored it. Texas and Florida has the chance to learn from @NYGovCuomo when NY went through this. #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Don’t be a #maskhole like @POTUS #potus #mask #keepingitreal #COVID19 #pandemic #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Don’t worry, you don’t have to explain why you don’t want to #WearAMask we know you suffer from idiot syndrome, no words are needed.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Especially if you’re going out to protest against the state sanctioned killing of Black people by racist, overly-funded cops, wear a mask. Protect your identity, your health, and the health of others while you march to dismantle our broken system. Take care.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Even institutions of higher education will be affected by the current #COVID19 crisis. F1 students will not be able to come back. I don’t blame them. Doing online courses for same $? I’d rather not. Coupled with the #POTUS ban, the US economy will be in chaos. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	FAKE NEWS AGAIN! You racist ass! A real leader would mandate masks to slow this pandemic! You let our country become the hot spot of the world! Your ignorance has let over 122,000 people die! #TrumpIsKillingUs #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Florida now has more active cases of COVID-19 then people who have died from it in the US. Y’all need to go sit your asses down and read a book. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Folks, please shelter in place as much as possible and wear your facemask when out in public! Don't play with your life or place your loved ones in harm's way!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	For the love of St. Peter, and all that’s holy in the world, wear a feckin’ mask! #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Found out my dad hasn't been wearing a mask to his AA meetings. WTF? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Gee, it’s almost like public health officials literally said, “take precautions now, or it’s gonna get worse and last longer.” Weird, it’s like they knew what they were talking about or something...  #coronavirus #NotAHoax #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Glasses?  My mask never got in the way of my glasses, that’s just another weak excuse for not doing the right thing. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	God gave me a beautiful set of lungs. That's why I wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Gone are the days when I used to watch @seanhannity on @FoxNews #Hannity lost his damn mind post 2016 election.  He lost my respect and all journalistic integrity.  It is no surprise that he is part of those who down played #COVID19  Please #America I beg you,  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Got flipped off by man old enough to be my father for telling him to wear a mask if he wants shop at Guitar Center, how was your day?  #okboomer #COVIDIDIOTS #Covid19isGettingCloser #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Great plan: continue as is and let #COVID19 spread rapidly, until we run out of hospital beds.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Great! but where are their masks? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Guess what? I had COVID-19 way back in mid-March right after the first “safer-at-home” mandates began. Since then I tested negative for the virus and positive for antibodies. And I STILL WEAR A MASK because I CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Had an atypical day volunteering with #MealsonWheels during the #COVID19 #Pandemic.  Made 17 visits to deliver 21 meals.  Spoke directly to 8 seniors (usually I see maybe 3)  After brief chats, all thanked me for the meal & WEARING THE MASK!  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Happy Friday. Whatever wonderful things you have planned for your weekend: WEAR A DAMN MASK   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Happy Mask Day, North Carolina. If you have a problem with this and/or feel it infringes on your “constitutional rights” then I’m afraid you’ve gravely and selfishly misunderstood the Founding Fathers’ intentions and basically the whole constitution #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Has anyone experienced MAGA people conflating BLM and mask-wesring? Apparently believing in community and equal rights now makes me a sheep.  So I guess Baa Baa Baa, Baby! #BLM #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Hey @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo I was at Harmony playground today in Park Slope it was busy and the majority of people were not wearing masks. Where are the playground monitors as promised?  #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Hey @realDonaldTrump  If real men wear pink, then real men wear masks. Apparently you aren't a real man.  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Hey! Folks who don't want to wear a mask I have a solution for you.  Dont Go Outside! It's that easy Just stay inside so you can 'breathe properly", and leave all of us smart people who do wear masks alone.   #maskon #StopTheSpread #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Hi! Snarky here. I have just declared the hill on which I will die, but if you want to know you’ll have to follow me! #BidenHarris2020 #Resist #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Hmm... Republican led Fla. Texas and Az. have record coronavirus numbers. Guess it’s not a hoax... #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Honestly mask the fuck up or get slapped the fuck up. With disposable gloves of course  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	How about we just ALL just stop being so selfish & stop making it about me,me,me & #WearMasks to help ease the medical personnel from handling all the #Covid_19 patients. Medical personnel HAVE to wear their masks ALL their shift! Imagine that! Stop bit€hing & #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	How about you talk to the hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers that use masks all day every day and see how many of them are dead from lack of oxygen? Having a link that works to whatever "research" you want to cite would be helpful too. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	How are things today? #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	How is wearing a mask unconstitutional? Is wearing shoes in a restaurant unconstitutional? For the love people...stop bitching, wear the GD mask for the next 21 days and flatten the fucking curve again. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	How many Arkansans died in Korea? How many have died on YOUR watch with Covid? CDC says masks can save 33,000 lives by October. Without a mandatory mask order your risking the lives of 330 Arkansans for a red hat. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	How many deaths will it take before assholes act like decent human beings and wear their damn masks? Asking for us non- assholes. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Husband told me about a guy in @Walgreens talking loudly without a mask while he was there this morning.   Called @GovChrisSununu to ask that he mandate wearing a mask in public especially indoors.   In 20 years we could discover that this virus cause cancer.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I  would love to come, but honestly many of your employees wear no mask or have them on in a way that serves no purpose. You have wonderful stores, but clearly those running the stores are indifferent to slowing the virus. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I agree in every way but damn that's gonna be a sweaty mask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I am a #Floridaian, mask wearing, social distanceing, hand washing. I haven't been to a bar since this started, not even to say goodbye to my favorite bartender who left. Please don't judge me based on the mornonic idiots spouting nonsense at town hall meetings. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I am an essential worker. Our store states that masks are mandatory and people still try to come in without them on.  We wear these for 8 hours a day,  5 days a week and medical personnel wear them longer. 20-60 minutes in a store is nothing. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I am so glad you are speaking out about wearing masks statewide. Clearly, you are much more intelligent than @GovRonDeSantis! He needs to wake up and realize that playing follow the leader (Trump) willl kill us all! #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	I believe 2 questions need to be added to Covid Screening at health care facilities: Do you wear a mask when in public? Do you maintain social distancing? If the answer to either is “No”, they’re seen last - let them sit in waiting room to see their casualties.#WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I believe the word your seeking is #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	I can only assume the idiots not wearing masks because they 'restrict breathing' must also remove the air filters from their cars, furnaces, and lawnmowers so they don't get damaged #Covidiots #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I don't understand why people don't wanna wear masks,which is a very simple step to protect their f*self and loved ones, but willing to risk their lives to get sick, spread illness to others, and bury themselves in debt if they are hospitalized #COVID19 #not #over #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I don't want to wear a mask at work, it's awful being in front of a hot grill with my mouth and nose covered. But, I do it to protect you, the least you can do is wear a mask to protect me and not argue about it. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I don’t like wearing clothes but I wear them in public because I care about others. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I feel sorry for the states with red governors. Thank you @NYGovCuomo for keeping us safe. Hey New York, let’s not screw up all the hard work. Stay safe, stay healthy, wear a mask, social distance. Socially distanced.....spiritually connected. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I finally got a haircut today. I took my dog to the groomer. My hairdresser wore a mask. The dog groomer wore a mask. Both businesses practiced safety measures. I felt smart and safe. It’s not that hard folks. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I guess I need to stop wearing sunglasses to protect my eyes because it's clearly part of the deep state, liberal media elite conspiracy. + 5G.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I guess I should add some hashtags so this goes past my 25 followers #SampsonCounty #NC #ClintonNC #Covid19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	I had a friend of mine’s father die from #COVID19 recently. Several others contracted it as well. The population of that one stoplight town is 1685.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I have asthma and I can wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I have dysautomomia and cyclic vomiting syndrome, meaning my body struggles to self-regulate my breathing, temp, and digestion. I literally vomit at random with no warning....and I’m wearing a mask in public, 100% of the time. You have no excuse. #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	I have, it is the same. After 30mins it is the same. After 1hr it is the same. Masks do not reduce your oxygen input. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I live in NW WI and 9 out 10 do NOT wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I love wearing a mask!!! -Said no one ever Wearing masks helps prevent the spread. If everybody wears them we can open up more and improve our economy. Why is this so difficult for people to understand? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I mean, at least she’s wearing a mask , that’s better than many people. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I saw a lady wearing a Trump 2020 face mask at Trader Joes. I am sure she was thinking she was owning the libs while buying her organic almond milk but I am just happy she was wearing a mask. I hope I see a few hundred more Trump masks all over Orange County. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	I think the very most Christian, Muslim, Buddhist thing you can do at the moment is wear a mask...taking care of the most vulnerable members of our society.  Jesus was all about it! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I was traveling today in trump county & despite the “masks required” signs, not a mask in sight at the c-store. An EMS crew even came in- no masks. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I wear a mask at work because I care about my co workers and the residents. I wear a mask while out because I have a family. If you don’t wear one, then you don’t about your or your loved ones heath    #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I wear a mask so I can make faces at you while you're talking, but you don't know - so I get to skip the whole whiney you're a bad person lecture. It's a win win. What's your reason? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I wish all stores / big corporations would do this.  I see an awful lot of people walking around the grocery stores etc in California where I live with no masks.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I work an incredibly physical job doing construction. It is often extremely warm in these buildings especially during summer. I wear my mask 8+ hrs a day without removing it. I’ve never experienced a lack of oxygen. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I would rather wear a mask than a ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I'll bet guys who won't wear masks because they're not 100% effective are the same ones who shun condoms for the same reason and have 6 kids. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I'm in Houston and you would be amazed at the number of people still out in public without a mask.  Unfuckingbelievable. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I'm sorry you are going through this. It is sad to see how many people in this country do not care enough about others to put a mask on. I just don't understand what the big deal is. Stay strong and I hope you are well soon. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	I've got covid fatigue and mask fatigue but I'll still #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	IL isn't one of them.   Our governor requires us to wears masks.   Wonder if that has anything to do with it? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	ITS LAUGHABLE THAT PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED COVID CASES ARE GOING UP.... WAKE UP DUMMYS , BEING RECKLESS AND NOT CARING , spreading it to your love ones #COVID19 #coronavirus #SecondWaveIsComing #SecondWave #texas #pandemic #virus #idiots #selfish #TRUMP #AMERICA #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Idiot sheriffs across the country can do or not do, as the case may be, anything they want re MASKS.  I DON'T listen to these simple-minded country bumpkins!  I follow the advice of my Governor & Public Health Professionals!  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If 2 individuals aren't #SocialDistancing ( within 6 feet of each other) but are both wearing masks.  They reduce the chance of spreading #COVID19 by 98%  Masks are our best option of defeating the virus.   #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	If All Lives Matter, you’d wear a mask and not complain about it. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	If I have to go out in public wearing a bra, I am going to wear a bra. If I have to go out in public wearing a mask, I am going to wear a bra and a mask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If I wear a mask can I call that my pants as well? Since a mask keeps your shit from flying everywhere and getting on other people. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If U really wanna freak out a Trumper if they harass U for wearing a mask, put on a big show about how U can't wait to vote for trump & what a wonderful president he is for telling U to wear a mask to keep U safe.  It will instantly de-escalate the situation. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	If a medicine came out that greatly reduced your chances of getting #COVID19 you’d run to the store & wait on line to get it!  We have that... It’s called: A mask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If a place of business, that you do not own, tells you to put on a mask before entering THEIR establishment, then stop your whining and put on a damn mask or don’t go there. Their house, their rules. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If he was battling cancer He'd wear that mask & be glad he was still able to see another sunrise #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If people aren't gonna wear masks we should just start putting our fingers in their mouths.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If people think “It’s their body. Their choice” when it comes to wearing a mask. Then they should have no issues with #Abortion.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If there was a drug that reduced your chances of getting #COVID19 by 5 fold everyone would be rushing to get it, that is what universal masking would do so #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you are not wearing a mask in public you are not just stupid, disrespectful, and asking to get sick, you are a complete asshole #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you believe that Jesus died on a cross save you but you don’t love your neighbors enough to protect them by wearing a mask, you’re a special kind of narcissistic asshole.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you care about the people who idolizes you, you would wear a mask. A real president would set the example. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	If you could see through my shades and face mask when I pass your maskless inconsiderate self you would see the amount of disgust and disappointment your lack of compassion for others lives causes me  #DoBetter #MasksSaveLives #Masks4All #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you don't like wearing a mask, you're really gonna hate sporting a ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you don’t like the #mask, you’re really going to hate the ventilator! #Arizona, #Texas, #Florida, @POTUS & every other selfish fool!  #COVID19 it’s real & it sucks!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	If you don’t like wearing a mask to protect others from a virus, wait until you hear about condoms.  Or abstinence.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you don’t trust the National doctors on wearing a mask. Call your own doctor and ask if you should wear a mask in public. #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	If you hate wearing a mask... you’re REALLY not gonna like a ventilator  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you have to wear pants in public, you also need to wear a mask in public #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you refuse to wear a mask please unfollow me ASAP.    I know I don’t have many followers, but if I do have any pandemic-spreading morons I want to be clear that you are NOT welcome.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you tell me your doctor told you not to wear a mask, you are either 1) completely lying or 2) you need to get yourself a new doctor. No decent doctor would ever advise against something that can reduce the spread of a deadly virus by 70%. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you think you can’t breathe in a mask, wait til you can’t breathe in a coffin.;#WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you won’t wear a mask to protect your fellow citizens would you wear a mask to help the economy and unemployment? #trumpflu #VOTE #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you're not wearing a mask & REQUIRING masks while you serve high-risk & elderly customers, then you're STUPID. The research is in & you're just STUPID & EVIL & deserve to go out of business. @Walmart @Target I'm looking at YOU in Louisiana & you COMPLETELY SUCK. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	If you’re not wearing a mask, I am not doing business with you. I’m not buying your products, your services or condoning the behaviors that show a complete disrespect to all other humans. #boycottnomasks #maskupcolorado #maskupeveryone #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Imagine being so powerful that just by telling people to wear masks any time they leave the house, you could save 40,000 lives! ...  Now imagine NOT doing it just because you're scared you won't seem TOUGH.  Trump is a vile, deeply insecure, mentally ill murderer. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	In Dar Northern California the 2x increase is because of parties for Memorial Day and graduations. Some from out of town guests. People do not wear masks. The small # of protestors did wear masks. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	In Northern Illinois most people wear masks, especially at the protests. Our numbers are down and that’s all the proof I need.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	In the last 5 days NYC had nearly 300,00 Covid-19 testing done and only 1% of those came back positive, that’s pretty impressive considering how bad we had it months ago #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Indeed. Can you imagine being a twenty-something yr old, survive COVID-19, only to learn you have 40% lung capacity? It's an awful thing to think about but true. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	It could be because all the conservative voters are too sick with Coronavirus to take the poll.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	It cracks me up that the same people that call liberals "snowflakes" are the very same people that scream "Tyranny!" when asked to wear a mask to protect their fellow citizens. Fucking #Snowflakes #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	It is really concerning how many people when I’m out doordashing I see NOT wearing any kind of mask or protection. 852 new cases in Ohio which is higher than the past few days....  Wear a mask, it’s really not that effing hard. #staysafe #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	It really kills me to see so many people wearing their mask UNDER THEIR NOSE.  They're not just dumb. They know. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	It's a shame that Mastriano is against wearing masks & should know that masks help save lives. #KarenOfTheDay #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	It’s amazing people think it’s a fashion accessory. The mask  is the real deal. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	It’s fine they said it’s getting better they said. I tried to warn y’all! 600 new cases of COVID today in Tarrent county. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	It’s totally people in LA tooI just finished a dr apt at Cedars-Sinai Hospital and a man was sitting outside the main entrance WITHOUT A FUCKING MASK! It’s a FUCKING HOSPITAL YOU DUMB FUCK. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Just thinking out of the box here. Do you think if a porn star told Donald that wearing a mask was sexy he’d wear one?She could be an American hero because if he wears one all the cult will too slowing the spread of CV19. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Just wear the damn mask. Every other country on this earth is getting people to wear masks. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE!! The U S. accounts for 5% of the world's population but 25% of the COVID-19 deaths! Do the math, moron! We are NOT winning and YOU are to blame! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Land Easy Solution  No mask in public space?  Photographed & published in paper & posted online:  "I'M A COVIDIOT! AVOID ME WHENEVER POSSIBLE!"  Stocks & manacles were used in olden times to shame.  Use the tools we have now!  #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Latest coronavirus projection from University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation shows 179,106 deaths by October 1 if nothing changes. But that number could drop to 146,000 if 95% of us started wearing masks in public a model forecasts. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Let's talk about hospitalizations - kind of an important thing that you left out. Also, it is clear you give two shits about American lives by categorically ruling out taking steps that may be necessary to protect us. And, WEAR A DAMN MASK! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Listen nyc if there is any time to pull your mask up from your chin it is when you’re in the subway !!!!! The subway is like a freaking virus incubator !!!! What you do walking in the street ain’t any of my business but standing next to me in the subway is !!!!#WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Look at this chart. It is an embarrassment and a tragedy. Americans wear your masks. #COVID19 #Masks #Americans #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Lots of news outlets and leaders have constantly gone back & forth with masks’ efficacy, which i can understand has caused the mass confusion.   Idc if wearing a mask has a 1% chance of stopping the spread, it’s 1% more than i would’ve had otherwise. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Lying is not helping. #COVID19 still here. #CaseCount rising. #DeathToll rising. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Makes no sense, a motorcyclist who chooses not to wear a helmet is taking his own life in his had, jeopardizing his life not someone else's or many others. By wearing a mask you are protecting those around you & visa versa  when others are wearing masks.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Making face mask mandatory is worth making some people mad if it helps protect us all. You’re terming out. Stop giving a shit if you piss off idiots who don’t care who they could get sick and support the mayors who are making it mandatory. @AsaHutchinson #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Man that @AndyBeshearKY is a great communicator. He’s got higher political potential if he wants it, in my opinion. Also, he’s right. Wear your damn masks people! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Mandatory mask-wearing is no big deal if you hardly ever leave the house. I can stand to wear a mask for the 30 minutes a week I’m at a grocery store. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Many more people wearing masks today, but most   men  I passed still refuse to wear them.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Mask enforcement in the future could include "personal citations," if we can't manage to #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Masks are not political. They are to protect yourself and others.  MASKS ARE NOT POLITICAL. THEY ARE TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND OTHERS.  It's literally the least you can do as cases continue to rise.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Masks are so uncomfortable?  Darling! Ventilators are worse...   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Masks don’t cause hypoxia, Covid does. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Masks in the sweltering, Italian summer heat.. we all wait patiently. We take our turns. I disinfect my hands after.   I walk down to the pharmacy to take my sleep meds. Again, masks, appropriate distance..   it's not that fucking hard..  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Masks need to be made mandatory in MI. I was at Meijer and saw many people w/o one. The store said legally they can’t make them. We’ve worked so hard social dist., staying home, and now are numbers are going up. @GovWhitmer @ElissaSlotkin @SenStabenow #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Mocked murder and the wearing of masks.  You know what to do.  Accept his apology and VOTE HIM OUT.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	My best friend is a physician. He reach out to me yesterday. He just broke down and cried. I feel so helpless.  Thinking about you, man. We can do at least this: #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	My brother said to me that people who wear masks are sheep. Long story short, I called my mom and asked if she could put me up for adoption (she said no tho... ) #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	My daughter is working as a graduate nurse ( waiting to take boards) and she wears a mask 12 1/2 hours a day- her entire shift-  at a busy Boston hospital. #wearafuckingmask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	My husband was at Home Depot tonight and a guy passed him and said his mask looked like a vagina DUDE ITS THE ONLY VAGINA THAT WILL LITERALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	My new pet peeve ...someone asking me when I’m wearing a mask “ Do you want me to wear a mask?”  I wear one for you so you wear one for me —obviously you don’t understand that concept. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	My puppy has figured out that when I start putting my mask on, that means it's time to go outside. So if his dumb ass can figure that out, I think that ought to be worth mentioning #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	NO CRISIS - STOP MISLEADING.  COVID cases are only 0.49% of CA population, 0.71% of pop nationally, and MOST PEOPLE RECOVER.  THAT'S 0% of population!  FACE MASK LAW IS A POLITICAL DECEPTION, AND MUST BE REVERSED. #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #Corona #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Native Floridian here who consistently wears a mask. However, half of the people I see do not. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	No mask on your face  You’re a big disgrace  Spreading germs  All over the place #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Nope. #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not a freaking mask on any of them. You are scum! No way you should be in charge of the  #COVID19 taskforce, let alone any part if this country!!! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not about your post per se...but LOVE both comments in your profile. Having said that, we're too gorgeous NOT to wear masks. All this beauty blinds, you know!  and we agree...6 feet apart does strike us as preferable to six feet under. #SocialDistancingWorks #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not good enough. He has the power to make masks mandatory. Anything less is unacceptable. #Pinellas made it mandatory. #Hillsborough made it mandatory. #Pasco made it mandatory. Pull your city and county together - do your job! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not happening this year or next year. Especially how some theaters make the staff wear masks but it's optional for guests. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not one person talking about “I don’t want to wear a mask” sounds intelligent. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not wearing a mask in public to isn’t a display of patriotism, pride, strength or any other lame excuse you come up with. It means you’re shallow, weak and self-centered. You don’t care about your country. You’re as unamerican as it gets. You are a political tool. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not wearing a mask is the equivalent of driving drunk!  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not wearing a mask is the new murder-suicide. . #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Not wearing a mask isn't a political statement,  it just shows how fucking stupid you are.... #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Note to Superheros...I can totally recognize people wearing a mask & sunglasses. Just saying... #iStillLoveComics #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Of course it’s still happening in Katy after people complained about it being canceled. #StayHome and #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	One of my wife's friends had a good way to sum up the mask situation in this country.  No mask = homeschool in the fall  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Only in America could keeping other people healthy be controversial.  #coronavirus #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Or people could just WEAR A MASK AND WASH THEIR HANDS. It is literally science. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Our lockdown has been completely for nothing because Stitt refuses to stand up & do the right thing for Oklahomans & require Masks.  All of that time, loss of income for what?? He’s playing politics with OUR LIVES & LIVELIHOOD   #StittsNotFit #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	People are only wearing masks on Twitter. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	People refusing to wear a mask because they have rights are acting ridiculous! What a selfish act! They act like they care about America, but are killing our economy! At least it's a simple mask we have to wear... it could always be worse. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	People who don’t wear masks are assholes. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Per @NYGovCuomo update today: Nationwide, coronavirus cases are up 30% compared to the beginning of June. There are 26 states seeing daily COVID cases increase over the past week. New York State is one of the exceptions — let's keep it that way. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Per CNN, US sees highest single day of new Covid cases, with 37,077 cases reported today.  Wear a fucking mask!  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Please do the right thing and mandate masks. It’s not that big of a deal but makes a world of difference. Let’s move things in the right direction and limit spread. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Please make our health a priority. Mask wearing protects everyone. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Q: Where do you derive the authority to regulate human breathing?  A: The same place that gives government the authority to mandate seatbelts... asshole. Q: Where do you derive the authority to selfishly kill other people because you're too precious to wear a mask? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Real Simple Facts:  More tests = more cases we know of  Less tests= more cases we don’t know of  #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Remember i was stressed about my kid's Senior Awards thing and masks? The room was PACKED. Maybe 8 of us had them on... including me and Hubs. And I learned who my real friends are gonna be in the #newnormal. Yeah. I saw you laughing at me, lady. Don't call me... #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Require masks in public statewide. Quit pandering.   I’ll put it in terms you can understand: Every dead person is one less vote for your reelection and one less consumer with money for all these businesses you and your colleagues value above all else. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	STICK WITH YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN, #HAWAII!!  PSA from your friends in #Texas and #Arizona, who know that you're doing it right! #StayHome #StayHomeSaveLives #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Safety glasses but no mask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Say it with me, WHEN IT COMES TO WEARING A MASK, IT CAN SAVE LIVES, again WHEN IT COMES TO WEARING A MASK, IT CAN SAVE LIVES, again WHEN IT COMES TO WEARING A MASK, IT CAN SAVE LIVES, again WHEN IT COMES TO WEARING A MASK, IT CAN SAVE LIVES #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	See MAGATS. this mask shows respect to others. And God’s amazing breathing system is unaffected. (See Florida. It’s always Florida.). Anyway. No hypoxia. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Sharing here, too, because we have to take care of each other! I Have done high intensity workouts in a mask several times now. No dizziness, no fainting. I did not die from the inconvenience. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Shocking, not really. They and other folks  that don’t believe in listening to CDC and  NO leadership from the White House just don’t take #COVID19 seriously enough. Their situation is what it is #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	So the penny has finally dropped about face masks.#WearADamnMask
20200626	1	So when you can’t get in when you get it, #COVIDIOT, I want this stapled to your big empty head. WTF is wrong with you?! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	So will y’all start wearing masks with the arrival of the #saharadust ?  Asking for millions of people who don’t want to get sick because #Karen doesn’t want to #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Some have babies, some do not. But for those who do not have babies, do we say they were not pregnant? If some have babies and never took a pregnancy test, they still had babies! Moral of my whacky story: Wear a damn Mask! (Or condom!) #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Some in CA refuse to wear masks because Governor Newsom mandated them.   Don’t be ridiculous. Put your fucking mask on. Get over your stupid politics. Be better humans. Die mad about it.    #MaskItOrCasket #MaskUp #MaskOn #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Some of y’all been wearing two faces ya whole damn lives but wanna bitch about wearing a god damn mask. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Some, yes..... some no. It infuriates me when people don't follow the science and take it more seriously. Some can't be bothered with masks etc. In the case of this virus, what you do affects everybody, not just you. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Sometimes I wonder if these people who think they know more than people are actual experts, realize how fucking stupid they sound? #FloridaWoman #FloridaDeepState #Devilswork #wtf2020 #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Soooo tired of people playing the dumb roll when it comes to wearing masks in a business establishment. I'm already a hermit. Why can't I go to 7-11 w/o encountering stupidity?? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Sorry I even have to ask. I live in Georgia and work in a Chinese restaurant. We still have not opened for dine in yet. It’s amazing how many people down here have the “it’s a hoax” mindset.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	TIRED OF BEING HOME? You can get your HAIR done! You can go to the movies!  You DON'T have to wear a mask!  You can go out to eat!  OR, you could get tired of coughing and gasping for air, and have a ventilator breathe for you. WHAT'S IT gonna BE? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Thank you for modeling appropriate mask-wearing. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Thank you for not falling complete victim to Trump’s bullshit. Stand up for what you know is right for the people of YOUR state. Be on the right side of history, not on the side that Trump stands. Over 120k DEAD. 40k NEW cases today! #COVID19 #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	That shit can breathe at home.  If you really can't bring yourself to wear a mask, just stay in your house.  The rest of us have the right to not get infected by you. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	That’s a small fraction compared to 120,000+ deaths! That argument doesn’t work overall you know!  Wear a mask & be safe. Trump’s abandoning this virus to focus on his re-election bid. #VoteBiden2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	The #NoMasks propaganda is coming out of Russia. Don't believe it.  Masks are not political. Masks reduce infected & asymptomatic people from spreading the virus.    #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #Masks #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	The comment was stupid, yes. But so was the fact that he made it at an Anti-Mask rally!  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	The entire fucking country is dangerous right now because if you walk out of your house without a mask on, you might die. #COVID19 #WorstPresidentInHistory #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	The governor of Arizona really used I can’t breathe as a result of wearing a mask is beyond disrespectful #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	The hardest part about being out during COVID is NOT wearing a mask. It’s timing your stops so you don’t have to pee in a public bathroom. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	The only thing that's killing people when wearing a mask is their bad breath. #Brushyourteeth #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	The ridiculous notion that everyone's "opinion" should carry equal weight as actual scientists' is going to kill us all. TJ the truck driver's opinion does not outweigh an epidemiologist's when it comes to wearing masks. It just doesn't.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	The same people saying all lives matter are the same ones saying they don’t want to wear a mask. Let that sink in for a second. Oh the irony. #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	There are a few places in the world that won’t let @Rotary vaccinate their children against polio because they believe it spreads the disease to children, which is 180° wrong. The same argument is made by the “no-mask” people here. And it is 180° wrong.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	These are the same people who are wanting that very same government to overturn Roe v Wade and tell women what they have to do with their own bodies.  #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	These places that say they cannot force folks to wear masks, like a clinic in @CityofBranson is full of bull I’m in Jonesboro, AR at a clinic and they give you a mask if you don’t have 1. If you refuse to wear-they refuse to serve you #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	They probably think it’s inconvenient.  You know what’s more inconvenient? BEING DEAD.  #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Think a mask is uncomfortable? You'll hate a ventilator. Idiots.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	This country is so fckin embarrassing grown ass people throwing fits bc they have to wear masks for the good of others #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	This summer is officially fucked and if you still think kids are going back to school in September, think again.  We're not going anywhere anytime soon. #COVID #stayhome #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	This whole mask issue has really shown just how many selfish and ignorant people live in this country.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Thursday on Thursday USA Comparison  18/6 NC 27.9k, Tests 517.7k 25/6 NC 40.2k, Tests 640.5k  New Cases gone up by 43.9% Testing gone up by 23.7%  Still winning #trump #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	To every person not wearing a mask when in public, you are incredibly selfish #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Today I realized if the solution to climate change was for everyone to just wear a mask, we would still fail. #ClimateCrisis #freedom #masks
20200626	1	Today's Quote/Unquote: "If everyone wears a mask outside the home, maintains social distancing with anyone other than the family unit and practices appropriate hygiene procedures, we will get the tens of millions of unemployed Americans back to work." 1/2 #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Tommorow we move into phase 4. Please wear a mask in public if you don't want to stay at home. I do not want to go on another lockdown. #Chicago #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Truly! I have asthma and that’s why I never take my mask off in public, bc if I get covid my ~aStHmA~ will land me on a ventilator, if there’s any even available. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Trump now thinks he is a spokesperson for the Biden campaign. Well, a least he would be doing something, because as President, he lies, he tweets, he … uh, that's it! #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	U.S. SEES HIGHEST SINGLE DAY OF NEW COVID-19 CASES, WITH 37,077 CASES REPORTED TODAY. #COVID19 #coronavirus #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsKillingUs #TrumpOut2020 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	UK Covid 19 is still with us. All those who went 2 the beaches today r the most selfish stupid people. No masks no social distancing. I really hope the EU stops u travelling. You wanted out of the EU well stay out.....#infectedIsland #UKStupid #ToryGenocide #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Viruses need a vector to spread. Covid-19’s vector is respiratory droplets. These droplets are stopped by wearing a mask properly. You expel respiratory droplets every day through normal activities such as: talking, yawning, laughing, etc.  !!!!!Wear a mask!!!!!! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	WHAT ABOUT MANDATORY MASKS @fordnation ? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	WOW #Arkansas we kicked it in high gear! Record speed to 18,000 cases of #COVID19.  When will be start wearing a mask & staying away from people.  Wash your hands & staying home when feeding sick. @asahutchinson #socialdistancing #coronavirus #Quarantine #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Wait... hear me out here. What if we all wear masks, and then later find out that this minor inconvenience was completely unnecessary. What a huge waste that would. Definitely worse than the alternative.  #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Want are the long term effects? Because it appears that dying is preferable to many who are now on 100+ days with high fever but are now testing negative anyway. Not to mention the amputations, and permanent damages others are experiencing. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Want kids to go back to school? #WearAMask  Want the economy to get going again so you can find your first job or get that promotion? #WearAMask  Care about anyone but your self? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Watching YouTube videos of people making face masks is my new ASMR. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	We have reached the "scared straight" portion of the mask-wearing program.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	We have two choices:  1) wear a mask in public and wash your hands, and then life goes on mostly normally otherwise  OR  2) we close down (again) or open up slower, and thousands more die and the economy continues to tank   #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	We need some sexy masks. Call them veils. Make it alluring. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Wear a #mask or you will be stuck at home trying to homeschool your kids again in the fall #COVID19 #school #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Wear a freaking mask...it's like the easiest thing to do to actually SAVE LIVES #covid19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wear a mask, it beats wearing a ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wear a mask.  #COVID19 #Florida #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wear your mask America!  Stop listening to buffoons. Help keep Americans safe. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wearing a mask during a pandemic is not political.  Not wearing one is.  Modern day serpant on the mount. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wearing a mask is an infringment on your rights?  How about my right not to get sick and possibly die? All because you can't be bothered to put a piece of cloth over your nose and mouth.  STRAP UP ... AND PUT ON THE FRIGGIN' MASK!  #MaskUpWA #Covid_19 @GovInslee #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Wearing a mask out in public for other's safety and/or your own doesn't mean you love wearing masks. Like, I still hate them and I hate everything about wearing one. It's not comfortable. But I still do! Stop being selfish. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Well I actually AM a City Councilmember, and I have supported masks in my community because they protect vulnerable people. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	Well aren’t you a nice little package ate up with dumb. The man was there 1st. Family came up & he asked them to back away & wear a mask. How is any of this stupidity & lack of care for human life his fault? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Went to a restaurant with hubs and daughter. Me and daughter had masks on. Guy behind the check in said “you need to wear a mask.” Hubs pulled his from his pocket and put it on and we were seated. This is how it’s done  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Were you concerned when you held your “celebrate me” party at Shem  Creek? No masks, no social distancing, crowded area with people of all ages. You knowingly provided a feast for the virus.Your concern is a bit late! #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	What I hear when people say "I can't breath with a mask on" is, " I don't have a STD so I don't use  condoms"! #IAMimmunecompromized #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	What he said is until there is a vaccine, keep your distance & wear masks in public. Since that’s proven to prevent spreading the disease it’ll reduce deaths. There are only a few treatments, some very rare & not available to all patients. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	When reporters asked him questions in the rose garden he claimed he couldn't hear them through their masks. He asked them to remove them. They refused. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	When your argument is masks are ineffective because they don't block air, yet dangerous because they block air, you've lost.  If you are going to come for me, bring your A game.  Oh, and #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Whenever I'm out grocery shopping and as soon as I see someone without a mask on, I turn myself around and walk the other way. Your selfish ass is not getting anywhere near me! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Where do you dream this BS up? So a surgeon wearing a mask in an OR isn’t getting enough oxygen? I sure wouldn’t want him cutting me up while he’s about to faint. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Where is the outrage for not being allowed to smoke in public places? How is wearing a mask any different? It is not taking away a person’s liberty, it is a mater of public safety...it is not complicated.   #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Why are they wearing safety goggles?   Probably the answer is that it's responsible and company policy since there is a risk, though slight, of an eye injury.    Yet, it's too much to ask for them to model responsible behavior and wear a mask?  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Why is he wearing protective glasses but not a mask?  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Whyyyyy do most people seem to think the pandemic is over and we can go about business as usual!!? Cases are still on the rise. Wear your damn mask. Wash your fucking hands. Stop being stupid and hanging out in big groups  #selfishfucks #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wish @cityoftoronto would make masks mandatory in all public places rather than leaving up to individual retailers and organizations. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Work. 10 hrs. My face hurts.  Still more than worth it if it helps even one person.   #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Would people wear a mask if we made it a contest, and the winners get free stuff? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Wow I never knew wearing a mask for 5 min could kill. Explains why the surgeons taking out my appendix all passed out during my procedure and years later I still have an open bleeding wound on my right side... Hospitals should really fix that. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Ya know what. Im done with it. If you think wearing a mask is more of a health risk than passing on a seriously contagious virus: You’re a fucking moron. No need to explain why you believe what you do. You’re just fucking stupid. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Year 2030 breaking news: patrons who insisted on going to the movies during a pandemic now report rare cancer from inhaling “disinfectant” on movie theater seats #StayTheFHome #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Yep it's all fake. the entire world shut down and ruined their own economies just to make you wear a mask cuz you so ugly.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Yes Idahoans should wear masks but the far right nut jobs won’t have it. We’re doomed #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200626	1	Yes! A good friend of mine died on Monday from #COVID19 and the mother of another friend died earlier this month from the virus. The virus is real. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Yes! Me and my princess. We have masks on in the car because we're picking up groceries and we're protecting the essential worker loading my car with groceries. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Yes, but 80k die in a year from the flu, not 120k+ in a quarter! No cure/no vaccine means that people will die unnecessarily without proper precautions. #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	You do know people are wearing masks all around the world, right? Wake up! #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	You may have had it and didn’t know. And you may have infected someone like @missmonikasmith Does that feel as good as you’re not wearing a mask? #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Your breath, my death. Wear a mask! #yourbreathmydeath #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Your daily reminder to WEAR A DAMN MASK!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	You’re an idiot. With a gang of idiot thugs at your beck and call. You’re killing your own people. #Biden2020Landslide #BlackLivesMatter #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	You’re thinking, okay, 30 people. IF they all adhered to their bubble of 10. And now there’s everyone’s workplaces, patios they frequented, golf clubs, hair salons, retail stores, transit maybe. It grows exponentially. So #stayhome #socialbubble #SocialDistance #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	Yup. Trump and COVID-19 are definelty Not making Anything great.  Tragic times we live in. I'm in Central Fl, so I am far away from Palm Beach County. To watch those young people trying to "recapture" normalcy, not wearing masks, it scares the shit out of me.  #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	and yet not considering the lives of ALL while the are coughing in babies faces... PLEASE! AMERICANS GROW THE FUCK UP and wear a mask... wash your dirty as hands and stay 6ft a part so we can all enjoy 2021... #COVID19 #PandemicIsReal #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	anyone recommend a make/manufacturer/type of masks? bought some crappy cloth type ones that are almost unwearable after 1/2 hr.  #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	complications as well as medical discrimination, and it's even worse for people of color. We need you to wear the mask to help keep us safe, so using the ADA to justify your actions is that much more despicable.  Sincerely,  Actual disabled and sick people #WearADamnMask
20200626	1	defiantly not wearing a mask to make a political statement is not only dumb, it’s also racist. #MasksSaveLives
20200626	1	from the Akron area, just south of Cleveland...  Leadership and direction has been competent, until a huge blow-back regarding mask wearing.  Most people seemed to have forgotten that a pandemic is occurring and are starting to operate per PRE-COVID19 times.  #WearADamnMask

20200627	1	Facts: The U.S. has 1/4 of all Covid19 cases and deaths worldwide, and that is not even with adequate testing. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Fake News!  Your a joke . Your killing people with your stupidity. #TrumpVirus #TrumpKillsUS #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Finally seeing signs that COVID-19 is not and never has been a red or blue issue. It’s a public health emergency and a matter of life and death. Please protect yourselves and others. Wear a mask. Practice social distancing. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	First time since March I had to get a train today. Out of the 10 people in my carriage, only I and 1 other are wearing masks. 2 people are chatting away on their phones. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	For the 3rd day in a row, the US is about to set a single-day record for new #COVID19 cases.  This hasn’t happened on 3 consecutive days since April 4. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	For those who object to wearing masks, take a long-ass look at what's happening in Arizona and Florida, and think in terms of that being the next couple of years of your life -- if you live that long. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Friendly reminder: wear a mask when in public #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Friends of ours have a son who is a hospital PT in Utah. When #COVID19 hit his area, do you know what his job has been? Suiting up in full PPE and repositioning patients' bodies to help them breathe. To BREATHE.   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Funny how the people hell bent on taking away women’s reproductive rights are the same ones yelling “MY BODY, MY CHOICE” the loudest when it comes to wearing masks and by funny i mean y’all are the biggest fucking selfish hypocrites (but that’s not news) #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	GA opened way too soon, and you are too cowardly to make masks mandatory. So much blood on your hands, Brine! You will be a one-term governor.  #KempGenocide #StopKlillingUs #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	GOOD FOR YOU. Sorry you had to deal with Covidiots but thanks for standing up and doing what others probably would not do. When will you be running for office so I can move to your town and vote for you? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Got a mani and pedi today. #selflove #stage2 #Ontario #the6ix #supportlocal #covid19 #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Governor Henry McMaster: “WEAR A MASK!”  Bubba:  “HELL NO!”  1,273 cases today.  906 currently hospitalized from Covid 19.   Nothing will change. #Coronavirus #Covid #SouthCarolina #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Great. Now I'm having guilt complexes every time I forget to put my mask on. Add THAT to my list of crazy. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Has anyone found the perfect mask for glasses wearers? I’ve just started wearing my contacts more because if the fogginess. I have a wire rimmed one but it doesn’t work well. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	He can’t fully on polish off a handle of Old Overholt or Black Velvet with a mask on? The mask gets too wet! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	He can’t just say, “wear a mask.” It’s like his boss forbid him from saying any of those words. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	He needs a tutu he spins so much...not a word about masks #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Help fight COVID-19!  Wear a mask!!!  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Here in Newfoundland, Canada we can proudly say that we now have no active Covid-19 cases, but there are people everywhere who wear masks when physical distancing is not possible. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Hey @Walmart @WalmartInc question: Why TF did you bother with signage in TX saying ppl need to wear masks if YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES AT THE ENTRANCE ARE GOING TO TELL PPL THEY DON’T NEED ONE? 9451 FM 1960 in Humble, TX. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Hey Danny.  I’ve been a nurse in Texas for over 30 years.  See you (or someone you love)in the hospital.  I will be the one in the mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Hey FL governor:  you’re once again ‘trusting people to make the right decision’ to wear / not wear a mask?  Same shat, different day!?!  Wake up, fool!  Mandate wearing a GD mask!  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Hi. I have asthma and I wear a mask every time I leave my house. I wear one while I exercise outdoors. I wear one when I have to go into work and go up & down stairs. Haven’t tested my SPO2 levels, but I can still breathe & catch my breath. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Honestly... I’m getting to the end of my fucking rope with these All Lives Matter and masks are a conspiracy people... like GET THE FUCK OVER YOURSELVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! #blacklivesmatter #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Hope the @CityofShawneeKS will follow in @KCMO's footsteps & issue a mask mandate soon! #maskupkc #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	How about taking some time to sign an executive order to require everyone to wear masks? This would save countless lives whether you choose to admit it or not. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	How can you be promoting mask while Roy says kids won’t be wearing masks at school in the fall?!?! #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	How does #TraitorTrump declare we are "post #COVID19" when the cases today are as high as they were when governors started issuing stay-at-home orders?! Quarantine worked to bring those numbers down, and now we're back where we started. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	How many mandates do you follow daily that you don't even think about? Seatbelts? I don't see anyone out there protesting seatbelts.  Masks protect more than just the person wearing them, whereas; seatbelts only protect the person wearing it.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	How many people did you & your crew infect?  #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	How to actually “stay safe”:  • Wash your hands     • take vitamins  • don’t wear a mask-breathe oxygen  • just life your life   • don’t live in fear  #COVID19 #Covid_19 #coronavirus #DrFauci #CoronaVirusTaskForce #StaySafe #COVID #fact #FakeNews #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I always wear a mask in public. My problem is as I don't leave home often so when I do go out, get out of my car and halfway to the store I have to go back to my car to get my mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I am going to wear a mask for my own protection. The Coronavirus Pandemic is Ravaging the State of Florida and there are people who are not taking this Seriously!!! I will not be one of those people! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I am screaming at @VP on TV, "Do you wear a seatbelt?" You BOOB!! mask wearing HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FREEDOM OF SPEECH????? You and @realDonaldTrump are remarkably stupid. Do you stop at stop signs?   Idiots!!!  It's a matter of PUBLIC HEALTH!!!!  WEAR A MASK!  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I am so upset that this federal administration is making wearing masks an issue of politics vs an issue of science.  Family protect yourselves and others whether you are a Trumper or not. This virus is NOT a joke. You may not die but you may kill someone else. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	I can’t take someone seriously when they are asking not to be muzzled like a mad dog when they are using their best mad dog voice to make the request. #WearADamnMask #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	I do alot of needlework and the shop I go to is run by a group of the sweetest older ladies you'll ever meet. They recently reopened, and require patrons to wear masks. The VERY FIRST customer walked in to argue with them. They sweetly refused to serve her. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I don’t know who needs to hear this but wear a fucking mask it’s not that hard #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I don’t know who needs to hear this but: #COVIDー19 is still evolving! This may not b her final form. And you’re just going around in #NoMasks willing feeding it exactly what it wants like it’s a damn #Pokemon ! Every new host could give her new powers. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I feel like the people who are refusing to wear a mask , are the same people who fail to put on a condom. #COVIDIOTS #healthiswealth #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	I find it remarkable that #COVIDIOTS is trending, but #WearAMask isn’t. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	I get it... I don't give a shit about your grandparents either. Difference is I have enough respect to wear a mask to keep yours alive. Get your shit together America! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I have a degree in English Lit and even I can figure this crap out. #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I have been debating "anti-maskers" the last few days, and their entire argument boils down to this:  Government and Doctors: "Wear a mask"  Them: "Don't tell me what to do!"  Their position is to be contrarian, and purely nothing else. Like a toddler. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I hear we have "flattened the curve!" Well done! How many more need to die now? Just trying to plan for the future. #MAGA #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I keep seeing people ask things like “if things are getting better than why are states enforcing masks or shutting back down?” My response is to KEEP ASKING THAT QUESTION, you’ll find the answer. Encourage this line of thought amongst those who are still asleep. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I live in a high rise in #Chicago. I put on a mask to protect myself & others. ~50% of people in my building don’t wear masks & it’s infuriating (& nerve racking). It’s a small inconvenience to put a mask on.  With federal leadership we’d be through this by now!  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I love the comment I heard today. Don’t wear a mask, then you are going to love having that vent put in by the recent gynecologist med school grad who just finished their last semester on Zoom. Good luck! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I need to be clear about this. Zombie movies are FAKE FAKE FAKE. If they were accurate, there would be a bunch of white people literally walking up to zombies and begging to get bitten to own the libruls. #Plandemic #Hoax #Flu #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I never thought I would agree with Dick Cheney on an issue but I do with this. #realmenwearmasks #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I see the same in Jacksonville.  One woman told the grocery clerk that she will only put on a mask if someone asks and that Trump doesn’t wear a mask so she believes him and follows suit.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I swear I’m going to bust heads if I hear/see one more person say, “It’s because they’re doing more testing.” Way to miss the bigger picture on the fact that these people have COVID whether they are tested or not. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I think I’ll do a daily FU to the non-mask wearing people who’ve made it so I can’t visit my elderly parents because I’d have to fly through two airports and quarantine for 14 days. #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	I think it quite obvious who amongst us don’t understand exponential growth curves.  #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	I think people who are against wearing masks are people who think their mask stink when it’s really they breath  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I think we should protest the anti-mask people by wearing our masks, but nothing else. I don’t like wearing clothes. I am now pretty sure it violates my constitutional rights. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I was in a store - 3 other customers and 2 staff and I was the only one in a mask. Ppl aren’t going to get it until we’re either all sick or dead. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I wear a face mask for you, your parents, your children, your friends. I basically wear a mask for every single person you love. So maybe don't be a jerk and please wear a mask for me, my parents, my children, my friends and everyone I love.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I wear a mask too, as does Wifey.  I have all of my lungs, but they operate at about the same efficiency as yours. I'm actually in 3 high risk groups.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I wear a mask when it is suggested by our health professionals - I trust them. I wear a mask because it will prevent the spread of the virus if I happen to be a carrier. My simple action of mask wearing may very well protect others from getting sick. #UtahStrong #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	I will never understand getting so mad about being told to wear a mask on a pandemic #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I wipe down all my groceries w/disinfectant, too. I haven’t hugged my mom in months b/c we’re both vulnerable (she’s 76 and I have an autoimmune disease). We wear masks and stay distanced when we see one another, and that’s just the way it is. Reality, folks. Deal. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I wonder if @senatemajldr thinks we should let the sunbelt go bankrupt now that they’re suffering from intense, overwhelming cases of #COVID-19 — you know like he suggested  New York should do #WorstPresidentInHistory #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I work at a hotel and have been wearing a mask there since the ‘rona started. I was thinking back just now and I can only think of a handful (if that) of guests that wore a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I would say if I see you wearing a mask, your level of sexiness definitely skyrockets regardless of all other aspects.  Oh, you care about others? Sexy. You put others before yourself? Sexy. You’re not an idiot? Sexy. You aren’t batshit crazy? Sexy.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I'm not a doctor but I can promise you that wearing your mask on your chin isn't going to prevent you getting the virus. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I've concluded that it's going to take dead bodies in the streets taking up people's parking spots to make people wear masks. That's how selfish some people are. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If "all lives matter" then the debate over masks and universal health care are over. #blacklivesmatter #dobetter #Obamacare #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If I get one more dirty look for wearing a mask in public, I'm going to start reading the outfits of the people giving me those looks.  Wearing a mask is not a political opinion, it's about keeping people safe you absolute fucking walnuts.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If I see you in public, not wearing a mask/face covering then yes, I am judging the heck out of you. And I’m concluding you are selfish, lazy, and stupid. Unless you’re a teeny kid. No one else has any excuse. #MaskUpUSA #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If he had only worn a mask it would have helped. Trump has politicized public health.  #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If people don't want to wear a mask, they need to understand that there are hospitals, restaurants, grocery and retail stores, that they won't be allowed to visit. End of story  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If so she should help you w/ your dopey mentality! You do not value science & you have not defended Floridians #NaturalRights. You are obese & lazy & weak in leadership just like #Trump & being his sycophant has cost countless lives. #ResignDesantis #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	If there was a pill that made you 5 times less likely to contract the virus you’d take it. Now imagine that pill, but as a mask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If they feel they don’t need to wear masks why stand six feet apart? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If we don’t get it together #Ohio we’ll be back in quarantine SOON!   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If you don't wear a mask in a store, whether you work there or are a customer, you are what's commonly referred to as an ASSHOLE. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If you ever wanted to be a toady, you’ll never be as good of a toady as Mike Pence is a toady. #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If you hate wearing a mask, you will hate the ventilator way more. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If you politicize mask wearing during a pandemic, you are a selfish, ignorant asshole. Pass it on. #COVID #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If you won't wear a mask, stay home. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	If you’re afraid to wear a mask, you can choose to stay home. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearTheDamnMask #COVID19 #coronavirus #TraitorInChief #SaturdayMorning #SaturdayMotivation #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	If you’re not wearing a mask every single time you enter a public space:  I don’t care what state you’re from.   You’re willfully ignorant.   You’re a spoiled ass brat child.   You’re the reason people are dying.   Your children are ashamed of you.   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	If you’re spending the time fighting a face mask ordinance, why not also fight for your right not to wear a seatbelt too? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Im fucking sick and tired of seeing people entering stores with no mask on here in Pennsyvlania. Business's need to start kicking people out for not having a mask and idc how pissed people get, to all you MAGA's STAY THE FUCK HOME IF YOU DONT WANNA WEAR A MASK #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	In MO, 2 hairstylists tested + for #COVID19 after working in close contact w/ 140 clients & 6 coworkers. Local #healthofficials feared it would start a major #outbreak.  BUT IT DIDN’T. Reason? Employees & patrons at #GreatClips salon were #required to #WearMasks #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	In NJ, you cannot enter a single store without a mask on. They’ll stop you before you get through the door, and I’m grateful as someone who has an extremely high risk parent. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Is @foxnewsalert responsible for the dangerous propaganda that made people believe that Covid-19 is nothing to b concerned about?  Has FoxNews gone too far this time?  #FridayFeeling #FridayVibes #FoxNews #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It is super awesome when customers make fun of my mask wearing and tell me it's just a bunch of "jumbo mumbo" (at least get the expression correct). Are people still shocked that FL had 9000 confirmed cases just yesterday? #DeSantisResign #DeSantisFailedFlorida #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It will disappear in April  It will be gone by Easter  A vaccine surprise any day now  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It won't kill you to wear a mask but it might kill someone else if you don't. Just wear the damn mask. #WearADamnMask #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	It's not over. Many more deaths to come since Trump & his cult followers have such fragile egos that they won't wear mask. The country WILL NOT REOPEN until common sense like masks & distancing are put into place.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It’s a bad look for the “Bible Belt” when it takes a government order to make us love our neighbors and selves. Wear a mask, friends. Even if you think it’s total BS. Not just for your sake, but for everyone around you, especially the vulnerable.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It’s a shame you won’t wear a mask! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It’s all about the masks. It has been since the beginning, and will be until the end. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It’s coronavirus. Underwear is optional, mask are not #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It’s just the craziest thing, still, to see face masks, politicized. I mean, effing face masks, of all things. It’s like saying screw wearing a seatbelt, I’ll take my chances, or better yet, screw the airbags, I don’t need them, period. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	It’s not glasses that make you look smarter...it’s a mask.  Wear a mask, I’m saying. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	It’s simple, either wear the damn mask or we shut down again. Which do you prefer. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’m a generally cranky, opinionated chemist who wears foggy glasses & occasionally has blue hair, and I successfully complete such Herculean tasks as shopping for groceries & going to the pharmacy while wearing a mask. Surely you, too, can manage. DO IT. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’m happy I live in a state where masks are mandatory to go anywhere #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’m legit picking up cupcakes for a coworker and I’ve seen SO MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT MASKS ON. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’m living in the U.S. for 25 years, been a citizen for over 10. This is the first time that I’m questioning if coming here was the right thing to do, seeing people who think they have the right to expose others to the #coronavirus by not wearing #facemasks. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’ve always been real with people when it’s obvious clear, yet watered down, info isn’t getting through. Here you are. Let’s get real. That O2 you’ll need because it’s a lifeline will be the least of your worries with #COVID19 if you start to go bad. Enjoy. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’ve been walking around for at least an hour with a piece of basil  in my teeth, but thanks to my wearing a MASK, no one  knew. #Winning #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’ve been wearing a mask every day at work for two months. Other than finding ways to avoid ear pain from elastic, I’m fine. I can even run up six flights of stairs wearing the mask and I’m no marathoner! Want to have an open economy?   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	I’ve worn a facemask 4 hrs/d, 4 d/ wk, 48 wks/yr, for 32 yrs = 24K hrs SO FAR. PaO2 is fine. No resp acidosis or tachypnea. Don’t understand that? Then I don’t want to hear your ridiculous reasons for not wearing  a mask. The real reason is that you are selfish. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Japan, where everyone wears a mask, has 143 cases of coronavirus per million people, the U.S. has 7,567 cases per million. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	John Hopkins University now reports the United States of America at 124,544 death of #COVID19. This is under-reported due to the dishonesty of @gop leaders such as @RonDeSantisFL @realDonaldTrump.  This means we may now be past the point of no return. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Just saw a quote from @UNICEF that half of schools around the world don’t have basic hand washing facilities - that impacts somewhere around 900 million kids.   But here, some can’t be bothered to wear a mask due to it’s inconvenience.   That’s #privilege #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Just went into Toronto and am shocked by the lack of masks and distancing. Glad to be back in #KingVaughan . #kingcity #StayHomeStaySafe #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Less @VP talking about #COVID19 and more from #DrFauci - election campaigns are not a good reason to put people and communities at risk #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Literally any person I see on the street WITHOUT a mask at any time, I am judging you and hating on you sooooooo hard #SorryNotSorry #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Literally the only two people in rosauers not wearing a mask were wearing Trump hats  #notsurprising #spokane #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Love it!!  I feel like an alien from another planet in my mask because very few if any are wearing them in Bell County! I have chosen to not go out very much. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Love this! Let’s think of others. We wear seat belts 4 public safety, don’t smoke in restaurants, bars, enclosed places 4 the public health! Too many asymptomatic carriers! We want 2 bring this virus under control. The best way to do this is by wearing masks! #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	MIKE PENCE WILL NOT EVEN SAY THE WORD ‘MASK’  ...much less recommend anyone wear one. This is absolutely ridiculous! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Making sacrifices is an integral part of society. Wearing a mask is an inconvenience not a violation of your rights. Its not politics, if you truly love America and her people... wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Mandate wearing a mask now. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Mask should be mandatory anywhere pants are mandatory.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Masks aren’t a political statement it’s basic human decency #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Masks feel stifling, they get hot and humid quickly and make me feel claustrophobic...  I'm still wearing a goddamn mask anyway! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Masks work to protect OTHERS. Some selfish #COVIDIDIOT asshole refusing to wear a mask infected him. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Maybe Memorial Day beach orgies & not following the recommended protocols like a 14 day decrease before opening each phase? Tried to look good before the Nov election by gambling with the lives of Texans, tying the hands of local leaders & refusing a mask mandate #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Maybe we should tell #Americans that if they wear a face mask for 3 months they’ll get a free gun- #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Me: Seatbelts were not always required by law. You know what brought the law about? Cashier: People being stupid? Me: And do you know what's going to bring about mandatory mask laws? C: Same thing? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Michael & Jason both wore masks  Be Like Michael or Jason ~Kathryn  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Mike Pence is a f’ing delusional IDIOT! Don’t be like Mike! Wear a mask. Save lives! #Pence #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Mike Pence is a poor excuse for a VP, a Christian and a human being...he is just as guilty as Trump! The testing isn’t generating new cases, not wearing a mask is! Just wear a damn mask!! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Moron here is the problem you get sick you infect me, my family, your family. You need medical care and you endanger the healthcare workers.  Put your mask back on. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	My Dad moved to FL. I’m afraid for him if this is what he’s surrounded by. Thank God he’s a smart man and listens to his daughter who is a nurse! WEAR A MASK! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	My anxiety levels are extra insane this morning. Everyone take care of yourselvesIf you can't #StayHome please #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	My autistic cousin can‘t wear a mask, is caused physical distress.  Now he can’t go in public.  So he’s been shut in without normal social interaction for months. Not good.  Thank You for mask shaming.  I hope you feel safe while hurting others.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	My boss said he won’t wear a mask at an upcoming meeting (more informal, but 12-14 people present)... so, I told him today I won’t be attending it.  I will attend a meeting the following day... host is requiring masks, ensuring appropriate space btwn seats, etc.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	My dad was a farmer now has COPD from NOT wearing masks when he was in grain bins or working with moldy grains or hay.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	My kid is right. It's like 2nd grade waiting for recess. Those that didn't act up also get punished and don't get to go to recess because some #COVIDIOTS didn't want to sit quietly for a few minutes so the whole class is penalized. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	My mask is on. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	My mask protects you, your mask protects me so when you're not wearing a mask and you look at me like I'm the asshole. You are the asshole and you're welcome.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	NY gave us the road map of how to survive this virus. The NY people suffered greatly & now other states (Tx, Az, Fl,) are experiencing it. People don't want to wear mask. Those individuals have to lose a love one before  realizing the severity of this virus. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Naive 2019 me: being an anti-science nation means we’ll continue electing terrible politicians and failing to address climate change.  Wisened 2020 me: that but also we draw the “altruism to stop a global pandemic” line somewhere before wearing a mask in public.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Needless to say unlike half of America and their fear of the unknown I tested negative because I practice good hygiene and keep my fucking mask over my nose all the time. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Neither does wearing a mask, Karen. Stop being a selfish b*tch. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	No @VP LIED about the #TrumpVirus #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	North Carolina just got all “political “. Chattanooga TN is listed as number 2 for new COVID deaths. Their Mayor is trying to get “political” but has to get Governors ok. How about we all get political? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Not wearing a mask is like driving drunk! Done be a jerk. Save a life. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Notice how Pence avoided the question about wearing a mask. Great leadership for the country. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Notice how all of the health experts are wearing masks Laura? Smart people are wearing masks. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Now Pence has been asked directly about masks. He can’t say it! All he will say is citizens should “heed guidance from local and statewide officials” ... because we all know that the virus acts differently in different states.  #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Now can you do humans? Ya know, the ones that are (at least for now) living? #coronavirus #COVID #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Now that they see it hitting the republicans states they say wear a mask. I thought this only hit hard in the Democratic states?   #MoscowMitch #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Now that y'all have seen some countries social distance, wear masks, lower their numbers and reopen, while America pretended it was "just the flu," will you listen to scientists? There's a lot we can do, and it's our duty as Americans to do it. #WearAMaskSaveALife #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Nurses Doctors Dentists Welders Firefighters Food inspectors Sanitation workers Biohazard workers Construction workers All people who proudly wear a mask for hours on end. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	OK, Bobby.  If you're ever wheeled into an OR, make sure you let the doctor know that his mask is unconstitutional.  Next time you encounter someone recovering from a bone marrow transplant, make sure you don't wear that mask. Don't be a jerk.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Oddly, I have a friend with asthma AND a lung condtion, and he was told to ALWAYS wear a mask when he is in public. He checked, and he has no drop in O2 saturation OR breathing issues. She's just furious that she can't get her way #Entitlement #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Of course I wear a mask. What am I, a red shirt on Star Trek? #masks
20200627	1	Okay, @MichaelRapaport's mask rant just made my day.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Okay, from now on I’m skipping every news article and feature about folks irate about requirements to wear masks in public places. Idiots galore....#WearADamnMask
20200627	1	On a busy tram with about 40-50 passengers. I’m one of only 3 people who are wearing a mask.  Anyone want to hazard a guess as to why we’re seeing a spike in Victoria? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	On day 119 of my #COVID19 battle - I still require nebulizer & respiratory therapy, CPAP during day, heart rhythm issues, blood clotting issues, kidney issues AND fever! The joy of the fever is Health Dept requires self isolation in one room. One. Room. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	On the bright side, all my zits can be covered by my mask, which is very stunning! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	On the first day, God made masks.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	On the whole, I'd say everyone has acclimated nicely to a life in which we agree to stop at stop signs and not dump our sewage in the street, so I'm having trouble seeing wearing a mask during a pandemic as some Big Brother-esque infringement of our rights. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	One of my good friends from high school lost his dad. He died alone in the hospital. It’s not a fucking hoax #DGL #LOD #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Opening up businesses doesn't mean that #COVID19 is no longer a threat. It means they now have room for you in the ICU and a ventilator when you need one.  Don't need one. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Our Flyinf Squads have spotted 592 people without #masks today in #Tiruppur ! DONT JOIN THAT LIST tomorrow ! #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	PSA: While you’re yelling at employees who ask you to wear a mask - Grocery stores, retail stores, gas stations, etc., are all PRIVATELY owned businesses. They have the right to refuse you service for not following policy. Because it’s a free country. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Patriots wear fucking masks and don’t wave confederate flags.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Pence probably isn’t allowed to say the word MASK. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	People are out their complaining about face masks the same way I complain I have to wear a shirt in the summer and men don't have to. Now, that's not fair. But nipples never passed Covid19 from person to person either. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	People who are not wearing masks during this pandemic are exactly like people are anti-vaxxers to me. Causing way more trouble than it’s needed. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	People who arent decent enough to put a cart in the cart return are the same people who atent decent enough to wear a mask to help other people.   Dont be an asshole. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	People who refuse 2 wear masks in public places r unpatriotic pricks who only care about themselves and not the good of the country. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	People who want to control the bodies of other women are seriously out here using pro-abortion mantras in defense of NOT wearing a face covering. Oh, slow claps for y'all, you are SO pro-life and not entitled and uneducated whiners! ... ... ... #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Phases of "reopening" have continued to prove their irrelevance. Get used to masks or get used to seeing the few dollars my teacher salary can spare to spend at your POB spent elsewhere.  #maskupIL #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Please fox news.  I m begging you.  Even if you think corona is not issue tell people to wear a mask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Please wear a mask. Remember when smokers said it was their right to smoke because it was their bodies?  Remember when we found out second hand smoke was killing people? Do the right thing for everyone and save lives. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Please wear your masks. Stop making this political. Stop being selfish. We’ve become hardened to the mass deaths. Just like we did with school shootings. Shame. Shame. Shame. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Precautions will work only if we all take them seriously. Masks mainly protect others. So all of us have to wear them to protect those who are immunocompromised. What’s so hard about that? I do care about you and your wellbeing #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Refusing to don a mask equates to those guys who don’t want to wrap it up because they “don’t like how it feels”. Don’t be that guy. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Rural America with almost no hospitals and few doctors? Good choice, no masks. Hope those cows have medical training. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	STAY THE FUCK HOME Essential outings only, with mask ON.  Self-discipline. It’s not easy, but it’s the right thing to do.  BTW, it’s also a great opportunity to get to know yourself a bit better, if you’re willing to look.  #coronavirus #BeTheSolution #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Same here. It sux. I bitch all day at work about people not wearing masks. They whine all day...it’s too hot, it gives me a headache, I can’t breathe good. When they get sick I’ll have no sympathy I’m sick of their whining. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Same. Witnessed this women without masks @HighlandFarmsON with her 2 kids, yelling at them like it was normal. The 5 year was wiping her nose all over the cart! What’s wrong with people?#WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Since I will only go out in a mask, I put one on my profile picture.  #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Skin breaking out? Wear a mask. Don't feel like doing makeup? Wear a mask. Don't want to be recognized in public? Wear a mask...I really don't see the downfall here. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So I guess Trump was wrong (again), Coronavirus is not taking a summer vacation! #notmyPresident #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So NOW you want to take measured steps to slow down the virus in Texas?! WBK opening up like you did wasn't a good idea @GregAbbott_TX ... smh. #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So Pence just gave all the numbnuts out there endangering the rest of us, refusing to wear a face mask, the okay to do so. Fantastic! #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So far I have only seen two people without masks here at the grocery store, plus one woman with her nose exposed. I am starting to get judgy. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So how many death matter to you? Yes over a whole 12 months. We have lost over 100k in 3 months with 1k deaths a day. Thats a death rate worth looking into. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So the open carry folk have no problem with a handgun on their waist or assault rifle slung over their shoulder? It’s for protection, right? But for the love of God ask them to wear a mask & now your infringing on their rights. Whatever. #COVID19 #CovidTX #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	So the teenager packed rally was an educational seminar on how to protect the community from COVID but masks weren’t required? Try again Mikey. #PenceLies #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So what does that make doctors and nurses who wear masks for 12+ hours a day?  Superheroes?  Yes, but also HUMANS.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So why as a whole are we risking it?   It doesn’t hurt to wear a mask.   In fact, it can help slow the spread.   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So you think if we brought someone from the plague times and told them we have found a way to reduce transmission by 70% and it's not burning a town to the ground but wearing a cloth mask, how livid they would be at anti-mask asshats. It's a piece of cloth!!!!!!!! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	So you want to open up NC, but you don’t want to wear a mask that will help prevent the spread of the virus thus allowing us to reopen NC... You guys are truly the dumbest folks in this state. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Some of my friends are dog owners.  I compared wearing a mask... to walking a dog on a leash in the midst of other dogs with/without leashes.  Suddenly a few of my friends started posting how masks protect others.  I think I might have done some good today.  #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Suppressing the vote might be the only way you can win.   #POTUS #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Sure, wearing masks is uncomfortable, but not NEARLY as uncomfortable as knowing my inaction caused one or more people to DIE #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Tempted to say to every person I see in a grocery store: “hey, nice mask.” Only I say it to people who are clearly NOT wearing a cloth mask but *have* donned a privaleged mask of “overt arrogance”. I’m gonna be a hit guys.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Tennessee is known for its volunteer spirit. Why is it so hard for some people to VOLUNTEER to keep their friends, family, and neighbors safe by wearing a mask? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Thank you. I'm nowhere near you to come inlater, but appreciate yr efforts! I'm not front line acute (community hospital) but still had patients test +ve. Ppl are naive. Still threat. Easy transmission, horrible disease. Long term effects. V much not over. #2metres #masks
20200627	1	That’s because wearing a mask in America is both a political statement and an IQ test. #MaskUp #MaskUpAZ #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	The CAT shows I've got "covid pneumonia" in both lungs.  I've been sent to a hospital in Tarpon Springs, but they don't have beds available . I'm waiting & hoping I don't pass out.  I'll likely be in the hospital for 3 days or so, assuming the best.  #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	The Trump administration has made the American response to #COVID19 a complete DISASTER. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	The VP lied to Americans today. We DID NOT flatten the Covid-19 curve.  Americans have leaders playing with our lives. It’s a deadly con job. GOP has colluded to mislead the people! #PenceLies #TrumpIsKillingUs #VoteBlueDownBallot #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	The data, medical professionals tried to tell you.   Republicans instead played chicken with reopening too early and #COVID19 won.  #maskitorcasket #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	The difference between anti seatbelt & anti mask people is that the latter is leaving a digital footprint of their ignorance for their grandkids.  #masks
20200627	1	The mask debate is baffling. The whole world is laughing at our dumbasses over a piece of cloth. Give me liberty or give me death. Die on ur own damn watch. Don't kill me. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	The other day I saw a guy running with a mask on and shirt off. That's the Mask4Mask content I'm here for!  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	The people who don’t believe in global warming are the same people not wearing masks. #wearyourfuckingmaskyouasshole #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	The way the US COVID-19 cases are on the increase I’m sure that Sheriff’s comment about not being sheep isn’t going to age well. #DontBeASheep #followthescience #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Then, why the hell won’t you wear mask when you go out? You don’t know who you’re in contact with. What their health is like. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	There is literally almost no reason to not wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	There's no such thing as "pretty good" distancing. Either you're distanced or you're not. #PSA #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	These COVID-19 positive cases in Florida are nearing Willie Taggart buyout numbers! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	These people have no shame.  45,000 new #coronavirus cases and this wannabe blonde, tone-deaf, privileged child is talking a #PledgetoAmericasWorkers WT is wrong with this brainless twit! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	They have them in those states because that is wear all the mouth breathing #COVIDIDIOTS are. #allblue2020 #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirus #RedStatesCOVIDsurges #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	They towed my car last weekend  even though apparently they’ve been “lenient” on parking (due Farmer’s Market tho, which why is that happening). Idk how they’ve not given tickets for masks which is 10,000x easier, ugh.   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	This American is also disgusted. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	This guy. What a douche. @RepMarkGreen, take your rugged individualism and self-isolate yourself in the corner.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	This guys a dickhead  Did he see the joggers entire jog did he follow where the dude went NO.. Muppet, he could've be running for 2hrs past heaps of ppl for all you knew..  YOURE perpetuating the resistance of wearing a mask it's not that f@#$%!g HARD!!! #Masks #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	This pisses me off so much! When cops, EMS personnel, city employees DO NOT wear a mask, why would Joe Schmo wear one? Where are here because idiots are everywhere. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	This was back in Feb and it was spurred by the shortage of masks for healthcare workers.  A lot has been learned about the virus since then. By not wearing a mask, you risk hurting those around you, re-opening will be delayed, more will die. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Told you #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #surge #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Too many Secret Service Agents out under quarantine to go golfing? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Travel ban was too little, too late. Politicizing masks has only created more division and is not helping to reduce the spread of the virus. Public health means everyone. Be courteous of others and #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Truth has liberal bias. Death rate went down due to once hotspots, NY, NJ, MA and CT are able to contain it. Going sideways in CA. Rising in most Trump’s land at this moment. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Update: My "friend" deleted the post.  Masks are too divisive.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Virtual date nights are always great, but I’m ready for them to be in person again. So can we all agree to wear our masks, please!? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	WHY CANT PENCE SAY THE “M” WORD? Wear a damn mask! That’s what all of America wants to hear from Trump and Pence.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Warehouse worker, hot, humid, and I wear my mask my whole 10 hr shift #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	We are finding out why the Honor System was not written into The Constitution.  #Resist #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	We cannot afford another economic shutdown. We cannot put those vulnerable at further risk than we can reasonably mitigate. The simple, inexpensive, and mostly effective solution that can curb the virus spread is wearing a mask in public. Stay open and help the vulnerable. #masks
20200627	1	We crushed it for sure in the beginning.  I'm worried about that second wave in Ohio later in the year.  When I go out, I see so many people not wearing a mask. Doesn't make sense.   #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	We had this exact conversation in our house tonight.  We live in Japan with the Navy. We are required to wear a mask any time we are indoors & preferably outside except when exercising & able to keep 6ft. Spread has decreased an incredible amount w/US & Japan.  #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	We have failed as a society. How is wearing a mask when you’re in public such a hard thing to do? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	We have lost Five from it & one we are waiting for the autopsy because he was at home  we I saw the full video of this meeting I was SO angry! They need to go to a Covid ICU & then the morgue  with no Mask & I’ll bet u my car they will wear one! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	We should be able to prosecute any individual who infects a person by not wearing a mask.  #MasksSaveLives #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	We're trying to protect the breathing system God gave them by requiring they wear masks! Isn't there a saying that God doesn't help those who don't help themselves? And when these people get covid, they threaten their caregivers! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	We've lost all sense of community. Selfishness and entitlement are bred from culture and technology.  And people are losing their sense of humanity. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Wear a god damn mask.  You have a responsibility to your fellow Americans you fuckstick.  Put it on and walk around.  Put your protest statement on it of you want.  Just wear the damn thing.  Ffs. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wear a mask, or don't go out. Your fellow human beings prefer to live. Personal freedom are irrelevant, when it comes to dealing with a major pandemic, that, if it doesn't kill the person, can give them lifelong health issues. #ChooseToLive #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wear a mask. I don't want to hear any excuses. I've been battling bad asthma for 7 years and wear it Everywhere. You're not helping anyone being rebellious , you're hurting us. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wearing a mask a lot better than a ventilator. This is about public health and the well being of our community, nothing political about it. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wearing a mask is a health issue, nothing to do with politics! It should be mandatory and a huge fine if you don’t, like wearing a seatbelt. For those of you who think otherwise look at the states that refused to wear them! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Wearing a mask is not a violation of anyones rights. Wearing a mask helps to keep us safe from the spread of #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wearing a mask is uncomfortable but that’s it. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wearing a mask should not be political. Masks do not silence you, you can still talk with a mask on. It is about caring for others around you — Not your politics. Listen to #DrFauci. Protect others, as you are protecting yourself. Be the solution, not the problem. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wearing/not wearing a mask IS  #political. Politics are ideologies, statements, & actions concerned with the functioning & well-being of the polis, the community. It's thoroughly political. It just shouldn't be #partisan. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Well, it was an accident... ? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   But, if Dick “Darth Vader” Cheney can wear a mask, can’t everyone? Really, c’mon.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	When 45 lies, people die. Corona virus is real. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	When Dick Cheney tells you to wear a mask, you know it’s designed to kill you.  #RealMenWearMasks #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	When I hear these absolute fuckwits saying they won't wear a mask because they aren't dogs...  It's a bit confusing for me. Because on one hand (paw?).... I don't wanna be muzzled  But on the other....... I mean.... Kinda yes please.  Moral of the story is #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	When these kids can’t return to college campuses, the towns that thrive off them suffer. The future of our economic stability suffers. Stop being selfish, stop making masks political and stop the BS. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Where was all this mask-activism back in February when we really needed it? #COVID19 #coronavirus #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Whether you like it or not, the duly elected governor has mandated that N.C. wears a mask in public. You not enforcing this means you’re in violation of government orders.  I hope your employees sue the shit out of you.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Who are the #COVIDIOTS without a mask?  #GOPGenocide #GOPDeathCult #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Why are people so embarrassed to wear a mask in public but not embarrassed to wear Maga hats in public? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Why does he need a mask? He's basically a cyborg at this point. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Why is wearing a mask so damn hard. You put it on and be decent!! It’s the same as please and thank you #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Why politicize wearing a mask?!  I don’t get it? Don’t be a #maskhole??!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Why??  This is totally unnecessary because people don’t have enough brains to #StayHomeSaveLives #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Will it take a member of your own family, Mr. Trump, Mr. DeSantis, to contract virus & die? Covid-19 knows no boundaries, not of political party, race, creed etc-If you're not protecting your constituents, you do not deserve to serve. #MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Would have to agree and Fauci whom I respected (less so now) as a scientist was so disappointing. If Mitch McConnell can say wear a mask (today’s message from him) Fauci and Birx can say wear a mask and stop dancing around Trump’s ego, and send the right message #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Wow the spoiled children don't want to ware a mask. Next no seat belts, no cacinations, no taxes, no school! Or just maybe, no grandma or grandpa!#MasksSaveLives
20200627	1	Wow.  Just Wow.   I want to Sarah Cooper do a lip sync of that crazy chick in the red T-shirt.  #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Yeah cause people wanted to watch how stupid you may sound again after running and hiding in a bunker plus u forgot the most significant thing, coronavirus it isn’t gone and now states are in trouble and guess what ur task force doesn’t seem to see this #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Yeah he of the Trump KKKlan, was responsible for establishing the protocol for the nation from the start. Now he wants people to listen? The federal government is a disaster. #TrumpPandemicFailure #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Yeah, also, people who can’t or won’t wear masks in public spaces should stay home. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Yes me too. We are longing to end this race at times!! I was 8 when we got seatbelts. Most of you weren’t born yet. It was a big deal but not an immediate  threat to our lives. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	You are absolutely correct.  Non-surgical masks are NOT PPE.  They are meant to protect others from me in case I am contagious.  It is callled humanity and empathy.  You should try it sometimes. #WearADamnMask

20200627	1	You claim the #mask mandates are infringement of your rights. Your refusal to wear one infringes on MY right not to breathe your germs. #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	You could put Pence’s dick in a vice and he still would refuse to utter the words wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	You people need to stop with that crap. Don't they tell you to wear a seatbelt? Don't you get a fine if you don't? Who is that seatbelt protecting? No one but you. Who does a mask protect? Your neighbor. You're not willing to protect your fellow human beings? #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	You should see the winners here in Maryland when they’re out in a shopping center they think because they’re not in the store they shouldn’t wear a mask even though they’re not 6 feet away from you! #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	You wear mask so that you dont contract COVID to some who will possibly DIE........ Dont be that Jackass......you dont even know why, how and from where you will get it,  Just do it so that you safe people's life.   #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200627	1	Your #FaceMask is quite comprehensive, though for extra protection, u can try wearing a large regular #Mask underneath your 'conical' one. It won't infringe too much on breathing, atleast not for short durations. @ICMRDELHI @PrannoyRoyNDTV @SoniaNDTV @UN #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	Your “freedom“ and Amendments end, where my life and health begin. When you don’t #WearAMask & #SocialDistance you put my life and the life of my friends and family in danger, thereby infringing on 𝗠𝗬 Amendments.  #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	You’d think the threat of public shaming would be a deterrent to acting like a selfish asshole and politicizing public safety. She clearly doesn’t care about others - why care about her?  This isn’t debatable-it’s a fact. Masks help. #WearADamnMask

20200627	1	only among those with no fucking social manners. how much would someone who is NOT wearing a mask freak out if you breathed/sneezed on them. #COVIDIOTS have the #right2die , not to kill me.  #WearADamnMask
20200627	1	ostracized by your anti-vax pandemic bros, and the power to stop your own asymptomatic transmission. The coronavirus is not done with us yet!!  Check with your doctor, or really anyone, to see if Wearamaskasshole is right for you.  #facemask #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives

20200628	0	In the last 90 days, you have had the @CDC @WHO @Surgeon_General , and even Dr. Fauci say there is no science behind masks preventing covid.  Yet the twitter rage mob has called for banning people who speak against them.  And you wonder why there are skeptics? #MaskUp #NoMask
20200628	0	LoL! We are soooo selfish and rude for not donning a face diaper!!!  #fakepandemic #NoMask #masksdontwork
20200628	0	Masks shouldn't be mandatory. Not everyone likes wearing Them. #MasksOff

20200628	0	No you haven’t. You found some poor woman (victim) trying to shop surrounded by Karens, NPCs and submissive sheeples. Good on her for refusing to submit. What’s up at the Standard Hotel btw? #ItsTheFlu #COVID19 #CaliforniaIsAShiteHole and #NoMaskOnMe
20200628	0	Noo!! Chest pain, headaches, profuse sweating, shortness of breath...why?? I thought I was having panic attack, nope...oxygen deprivation!! And o2 deprivation lowers immune system. How can children b req’d to wear? #Homeschooling #NoMask
20200628	0	So can kids wear masks correctly all day in school? NO Masks for kids!! Kids need normalcy. Kids aren't getting sick, kids aren't spreaders. #OhioansAgainstHybridEducation #NoMasks
20200628	0	Such bs. Some dude wearing a “cloth covering” or a bandana that gets stuffed back in his pocket-right. “If” this virus really aerosols then you Drs are ALL complicit advising us to wear these hazardous worthless leaky masks for a fake sense of security. #masksdontwork
20200628	0	Suddenly out of nowhere, North Carolina ordered mandatory masks to enter any place of business. Nope! Done fine with no mask all this time. Not going to start wearing masks now. #NoMasks
20200628	0	The card was a joke.. and I managed to point out that many leftists, like you, pushing the mask are liars.. and it is a game to you, and there is no card needed to say #NoMask

20200628	1	 And yet if they’d only paid attention in beginning baby science class they would know that Oxygen and CO2 are both gasses and therefore will penetrate a mask. Both ways. The mask is to protect others from your FLUIDS even if you don’t have symptoms. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	"Crowds". Like when 2 people pass on a narrow sidewalk. "Crowds" is you and the possibility that 1 other person might also be out there. So let's stop complicating and quibbling and qualifying and discussing. If you go out, wear a mask. Same as you wear pants.  #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	1) Reopenings are premature & about the economy, not public health 2) cases are rising in 48 states & steeply in those that opened w/o precautions (plus they're under-testing/-reporting) 3) spikes didn't occur among protesters becuz they wore masks & quarantined 4) #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	@GovRonDeSantis your people are looking to you for leadership. Save Lives, require the damn masks. This shouldn’t be political. But if you make it so, we will too. #requiremasksflorida #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	@SecAzar can you please correct your statement from this morning w.r.t. individual responsibility. You don’t wear a mask to protect yourself. You wear it to protect others. Like vaccines, it doesn’t work if only some decide to do it. Protect others #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	@TexasGOP  what the????   #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	@VP @realDonaldTrump When exercising your rights to free speech and assembly, you don’t meet inside a burning building! It would only be karma, if you both caught severe cases of #COVID19 for unnecessarily exposing your sheep. #ResignNow #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	@Walmart start protecting your employees and customers and start regulating and mandating masks. I probably have it already as well as 8 other associates in my neighborhood market.  Please at least pretend you care.  They actually help. #masks
20200628	1	@cvspharmacy just left your Oak Park, I’ll location and was horrified to see that NONE of your employees had a mask on properly. And when I asked them to please put their mask over their noses, they got visibly angry with me. I won’t be back this is unacceptable. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	@fox8news @wkyc @malonespeaking , when will @GovMikeDeWine & retailers wake up and mandate masks to enter stores?  Virus is growing. They are more concerned about profits than the wellbeing of employees and customers.  I’d gladly lose a customer to save a life. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	@henrymcmaster wants us to support the local economy - however to do so would risk our lives.  Supporting only businesses who require a mask. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	@jaredpolis @GovofCO It is . to require masks in public for everyone. It is a health issue not a political one. Please do the right thing. Lives are literally at stake over a 4x6 inch face filter. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	@realDonaldTrump and @VP are out there parading infected staff members, not wearing masks, so they can be out campaigning. Dozens infected. Social distancing not required. 126,000 Americans dead. #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Bullshit! My husband wears a mask at work 8-12 hrs a day 6 days a week 20+yrs. He's never had a single health issue nor does he complain. If masks were unsafe, OSHA wouldn't require them. #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Deplorable. where are the mask? You are supposed to be examples to the community. Infuriating that you chose to be so irresponsible esp when Pgh is rising in diagnosis. Poor example of “caring for Gods children “ when you can’t wear a mask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Did you even read the study? It said effectiveness was based on ADHERENCE and people were not adhering, therfore; they didn't work. My husband wears a mask at work 8-12 hrs a day 6 days a week 20+ yrs. not a single adverse event. OSHA wouldn't require if unsafe. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Do not think for a minute that governments cannot mandate the wearing of facemasks in public.   That was exactly what many said about seatbelts,  and motorcycle helmets,  and life jackets.   “The public welfare requiring it” is a fundamental legal concept.     #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Exactly! We don’t bitch about hanging to wear shoes/shirts/pants In public and In stores, what’s the difference with a mask? No shoes/shirt not service is acceptable, but no mask no service is like being asked to cut off your limb  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Few people are wearing masks. Beyond comprehension. Clapping for #healthcareworkers then disrespecting the sacrifices made. The dead. Those still suffering. The pandemic still here. No vaccine. Many don't seem to care. Solution  = mandate the wearing of #masks #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	For someone who has a breathing problem, she sure is getting worked up. It won't hurt her to wear a mask for 30 minutes. What is with these people who refuse to wear a mask? #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Found out my brother and dad don’t wear masks/believe they make you sick not Covid. I guess I’ll see them in about a year and a half #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Grateful I live in a very liberal city where almost 100% of people where masks inside stores. Although it should definitely be universally required. If you don’t want to or “can’t” wear one, don’t go inside stores. Easy as that. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	HI.  WEAR A FUCKING MASK FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE!  THANK YOU.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Had a nice customer say "thank you" for not letting a customer in without a mask.  She was entertained by the swearing he was doing outside afterwards.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Had to check into a hotel bc lights are out due to the storm. One person was wearing a mask #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Her breathing problem didn’t stop her from ranting like a crazy person and if she really had a breathing problem she would be doing everything she could to not catch the virus... like wear a mask! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Her kids will wear bags over their heads rather than be seen with this woman.. what an embarrassment during a public health crisis.. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Her pipes seem fine to me! If she has a breathing problem she should have her groceries delivered or go to a store that doesn't have a strict mask policy.  As for me I want to wear a mask for you and I want you to wear a mask for me!   #coronavirus #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Hey @SamuelLJackson, can you put out a #PSA about wearing a muthafuckin’ mask?.... I believe your services are needed #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Hey dumb dumb, wear a mask! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Hey dumbasses, the mask should cover your mouth and nose. Having it cover your mouth as your breathe out of your nose makes you look like a fool. And it could kill you.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	How about, “Wear a damn mask”.   Stop being such a snowflake.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	How come I go out for brief, socially distanced, mask-wearing outings in King County, WA, (phase 2, but with mandatory mask wearing) and see people in public places not distancing & without masks on? I would slap you, but don’t want to contaminate myself #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I absolutely loath people who wear #masks below their nose. I'd rather that you don't wear a mask at all than wear one wrongly. If you don't wear a mask, we know you don't care. But to pretend to care but do so purposesly ineffectively is just, well, silly! #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I agree. I'm an essential worker and now I'm waiting on my test results for covid-19 after fighting for my life earlier this year from brain tumor.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I am a severe asthmatic...I wear a mask with an N95 filter when going to the grocery store, etc....I call bullshit! #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	I do not leave my home without a mask!  #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I do think some of the social media shaming is working. This morning when I went out I saw a much higher percentage of people wearing masks. #anecdotalevidence #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I encountered my first Karen today at the pharmacy- no mask or social distancing. Her RX was $1 & she ran a debit/credit card. The cashier told her that the card wasn’t working, but #Karen insisted on using it...for $1 despite the fact she had cash #Karenchronicles #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I have a breathing problem -  I like to breathe!   I do not want to get COVID and I don't want you to get COVID. So I wear a mask!    My breathing problem is solved!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	I have a breathing problem but masks do not cause a significant dip in my O2 levels. You know what will cause a significant dip in those levels.....having my lungs fill up with fluid  It’s not hard and literally the least you can do. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I have an idea. Everyone has their temperature taken at the entrance of the bar. Everyone not wearing a mask gets it taken rectally. #masks
20200628	1	I have asthma. I wear a mask, which creates a humidified environment that actually helps my breathing. I'm sorry I wasn't wearing one sooner.  I'm really sick of people's bullshit excuses.   #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I have lost all hope in mankind. A women just replied to the news of today's numbers with "it's only 15 deaths". Well Karen, how many deaths are acceptable for you? Would you say the same if it was your family member? One death is too many!! #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	I have noticed that my allergies have improved while wearing a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I have taken to saying, "Hi Karen" to every white woman I see in public not wearing a mask. The reactions are pleasing.  #KarensGoneWild #Karens #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	I hope the baby is ok! This is horrible this is the reason we need to wear mask to take care of ourselves and others! The mask is not a political statement it’s for your own good! #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I hope your  "y'all" doesn't include florist & myself. We are both advocating for the mask  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I just saw a woman jogging. In Florida. In this humidity. With a mask. #noexcuses #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I live in Florida. Like 30k cases in 4 days. And our governor refuses to mandate masks because he “trusts the people to make safe decisions.” I’m buying a boat and an island and disappearing forever. Bye, y’all. Been real. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I ordered cotton fabric in April & it finally arrived this past week. I’m making more masks because given the numbers, the US is going to be dealing with this for eternity.  At least my friends know someone who can sew? #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I seriously don't get the big deal about wearing masks.  They're not that bad and you can make faces at people without them knowing.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I shop at Harris Teeter more than weekly. I won’t be back. If you can’t follow the governor’s mandate and keep your customers safe, you don’t deserve our business. There is curbside pickup for those who don’t want to wear masks. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I swear to god if I see one more person on Facebook claim that covid is a hoax and it will disappear after the election...I’m gonna lose my shit. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I swear to god, if Asus, Razer, Corsair or anybody started releasing LED RGB masks then everyone and their mother would be wearing them  Put the fucking mask on people #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I think the "Democratic Bitch" comment shown the true reason she is choosing not to wear a mask. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I thought that this lady was smarter than that #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I went pandemic grocery shopping today. Planning to not leave my house again for a while. #Covid numbers reported in Miami-Dade today exceed peek Covid numbers at the beginning of the #pandemic, no one is wearing masks except inside stores where they are required. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I will be the 1st to admit i HATE wearing a mask. Always have even when woodworking. They fog my glasses and make my face sweat. But...I WILL CONTINUE TO WEAR THEM UNTIL WE ARE DONE WITH THIS SCOURGE B/C IT'S THE RIGHT, UNSELFISH THING TO DO!!! #TRE45ON #BLM #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I will not go out in public without a mask and gloves and hand sanitizer. I refuse to let others kill me. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I wish people comparing mask wearing to seatbelt or helmet usage. Your seat belt protects YOU. Your mask protects EVERYONE ELSE. It isn't about you. Stop engaging in germ warfare. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I work for a moving company in friggin Texas. I sometimes have to wear a mask for up to 12 hours a day. I dont wanna hear anymore about "oxygen levels" or "fear mongering". Does it suck? Sure. Does it suck less then getting my loved ones sick? Fuck yea. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I would be a majority of people refusing to wear masks screaming "I WONT COMPLY" are the same people that when a black person is killed by cops scream "HE SHOULD HAVE COMPLIED." #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I'm glad you finally understand the truth about #PutinsPuppet. If you wear a mask that means you don't support him. #TraitorTrump #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I'm sorry but if you don't wear a mask you are putting other people's lives at risk and deserve to get the coronavirus. fuck u #amyduncan @L_A_Baker #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I've had asthma since birth. Was in NICU for a week with pneumo out of the womb. Two dozen more times including several hospitalizations by age 15. Chronic bronchitis 3x/year.Yet I can still breathe when I wear my mask in public. YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	IS THIS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.....WITH SO MANY STUPID PEOPLE..... MAKING AN ISSUE OVER WEARING A DAMN MASK?  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If I can do this... Y'all can stay the fuck home too.   And wear a fucking mask.   #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If Trump supported wearing mask, this would be a nonissue #NurseTwitter #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If every American would wear a mask in a public indoor place or outdoors where they can’t distance, we wouldn’t need to lock businesses down. Yet, @GOP as a party decided that masks are a political hill to die on for some reason. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If everyone who posted on social media about being sad for the #Classof2020 missing prom and graduation started to #WearAMask , maybe the #Classof2021 would get to have theirs. #maskuptoopenup #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If my asthmatic self can wear a mask 6 hours a day while doing my normal salon duties, plus the increased cleaning regime, then you can wear yours for the quick grocery shopping trip Karen and Phil. #MaskUp #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If the Trump crime family had an investment in any type of mask company you can be damn sure masks would be nationally mandated and all his followers would be proudly wearing them. There would be zero “breathing” or “oxygen” concerns. #COVID19 #Sheeple #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If there’s one takeaway TV people learn from the pandemic, it’s to have doctors wearing masks. We can still see who the actors are. More believability pls. Thx. @nbc @ABCNetwork @CBS @Showtime @FOXTV @netflix @AppleTV @PrimeVideo #medicaldramas #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If these people don't like wearing a mask, think of how they will fell with the respirator. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If they'd said  "If you wear masks the opposing political party will cry into a mug that you can drink from."  Everyone would be wearing a mask. Instead only SOME are wearing masks and the rest are shitting their pants in anger over it.  P.s.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If we have to have a "Real Men Wear Masks" campaign to convince grown ass men to wear a mask, we are a deeply broken society.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If we want football to happen this year, please wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands!!! We can’t let our guard down, we will beat this virus, we are all on the same team!! #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If wearing a mask is the biggest problem you have, then your life is pretty freaking great and you should #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If wearing a mask prevented you from contracting #COVID19 rather than spreading it... this would be a non-issue.   It would also help if Trump hadn’t politicized mask wearing.   #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If you can wear a stupid red hat, you can wear a damn mask.  I really, really hate this president.   #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If you don't like my mask, don't look at it.  #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If you don't wear a mask to protect against the spread of COVID-19, you can never criticize the judgement of any character in a horror movie ever again. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If you don't wear a mask you're a domestic bioterrorist . No better than Al-Qaeda on 9/11 . Probably worse actually #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If you have a breathing problem, wearinga mask for a 10 min will no do amy harm to you. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	If you really have a breathing problem bad enough that you can't wear a mask, you'd be using a more complicated device that provides filtered air to you. So STFU you lying POS. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If you think wearing the masks are uncomfortable, you definitely won't like those ventilators! #MasksOn
20200628	1	If you would use a condom to protect you and your partner from STDs, wear a fucking mask!  #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	If you're having trouble breathing with a mask on, you're going to have worse trouble breathing with #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Imagine someone having to explain to little Johnny or Mary that granny or grandpa is dead because people were too selfish to #WearAMask for 15mins in the grocery store   #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Imagine that there’s a cheap, non-toxic product available that if +80% used it, #COVID19 would stop being a pandemic.  Everyone would rush to use it, right? Even the ignorant and the stupid would advicate its use.  That product is real - it’s called a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Imagine you are naked and a naked person pees on you. Pants would protect you somewhat. If the other person also wore pants, you would be even more protected. #WearAMask #SaveLives #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	In search of medical doctors advising their patients not to wear masks. DMs are open.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Instead of wearing a mask in public, just hold your breath.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	It is better to wear a mask than a ventilator. Protect yourself and others. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMaskPlease
20200628	1	It will definitely be interesting to see... Canada   has banned travel to the US except for family (I believe) & I think AU & NZ has done the same ...until the States get their act together! ...like  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	It's not about IQ.  It's about I. Refusing to wear mask social distance is pure narcissism. This is our civic, moral, social responsibility. As important as voting, protesting etc...#WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I’m an avowed antizoomer. If I do appear on zoom, though, I’m wearing a damn mask! #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I’m kind of convinced the ppl who are complaining about wearing masks are the ppl who have stank breath and have to smell their own breath with the mask on  #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	I’m sending thoughts and prayers to all those people who are suffering by wearing a mask. If only we could make masks out of guns. Maybe they’ll want to wear it then...#ThoughtsAndPrayers #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I’m the kid that did the entire group project by themselves. So quarantining, social distancing, and wearing a mask comes naturally. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	I’m the king of barebacking and even I wear a mask out. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Jesus you guys. Almost 50 thousand cases yesterday?  #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Just now at a convenience store (in WA where masks are MANDATORY), there's a couple in front of me (maskless) who are from Alabama.  Female says to the cashier, "We're here because my daughter is having a baby next week" No QUARANTINE NO MASKS #COVIDIOTS #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Just saw a diagram of someone intubated and on a ventilator.   Heart rate spiked and nearly had a panic attack. From a diagram.  I never want to actually have that happen to me or anyone else.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Just saw a young girl drop her face mask in a parking lot and put it back on her face #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Just wear a mask.  Between that article I shared and Kaval saying what he said, I can't even right now. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Karen just wants attention, because she waited in the queue with her mask on.  And entered store with her mask on. So all this was just a play for attention. #wearyourmask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Killing your citizens to own the libs . Let’s put this into a perspective that even gov Kemp can understand: Everybody wears masks in public thru September or THERE WILL BE NO GEORGIA FOOTBALL #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Let me guess...  You also don’t we’re a seatbelt when you drive cuz the government tells you to right?   What rights are taken away wearing a mask to help protect others?   #BeBetter #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Let me just add, “When you wear a mask, you’re Pro-life!” #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Listen folks, if @DanhausenAD can wear a mask during a wrestling match then you can wear one when go inside a store. I don’t want to hear the bullshit anymore about how you can’t breath with it on. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Mandate masks! Simple yet effective. This should not be political. Do the right thing! #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Maryland may have it better than most but clerks and salespeople still have it tough...don’t they? And as they risk their health to honorably work to put food on the table and keep health insurance.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	More importantly: why's this Karen wearing a Bebe shirt? She can't wear a mask, but nor is she embarrassed to wear shit that hasn't been popular since I was in middle school in the late 90's? #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Must be nice living in Denial. You’re right you can’t live in fear forever but you can die quicker with COVID-19 & take unsuspecting people with you if you don’t wear a mask. Yes.....YOU could be the carrier killing people as you go. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	My cousin wears a mask with replaceable respirator filters and a friggin shield bc of her asthma and seriously I have not heard a complaint from her. And trust me, if she had any, we'd all know.  #MaskUpPA #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	My fantastic nephew George, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, wears a mask outside..so if he can manage it at 65% lung capacity then anyone can #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	My neighbor, unfortunately, has COPD and will NOT go out without a mask. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	My profile pic has had a mask since 2018! #OG #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Necrophilia too.  #StayHome, and if you need to go out, #WearAMask  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Nice to see you, too, Karen. Enjoy the rest of your day! #COVIDIOT #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	No words to describe the degree of disgust that I feel for the egregious actions of the self-righteous, fraudulent #sciencedeniers masquerading as people who care abt #civilliberties & abt the welfare of others. Their callousness is sociopathic. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Nope on homeschooling but yes On #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Nope. Our disaster of a #president and his sidekick #Pence have seen to it to politicize saving lives. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	North Carolinans are fortunate to have @NC_Governor in office. If we had a Republican Governor, we would have much more positive Coronavirus cases. #NCPOL #NC09 #MaskUpNC #WearADamnMask #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Not political it is just science! Masks work! Trump stop fueling this fire! #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Not wearing #masks  is not only epidemiologically dangerous but also morally wrong because it involves a careless attitude towards those people who want and/or need to protect themselves and their community, especially the most vulnerable. #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Now days even dog has to have a mask(German Shepard breed standard)!!! #PPE #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	OVERNIGHT !  9,500+ new #coronavirus cases in Florida, another record day..  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Of all the stores looked at how many employees had masks on?   Spending 30 minutes in a mask to respect the people showing up for 8 hours risking their lives for your food is being a community member, sadly for three months we have more tourists than locals #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Oh My Goodness...Shut Up! Save your damn breath and leave! #StupidKarenStrikesAgain Just another person who thinks  #TheRulesDontApplyToMe  #COVID19  If she can yell, she can #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Only in the us is mask wearing seen as an expression of your political views. #covid19 #masks
20200628	1	Only weak men worry about looking weak #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Our county sheriff said the same as has the local police dept.  CA’s a blue state, but Stanislaus County’s red. Lots of people refusing to mask up while we’ve become the state’s virus “hot spot.”  I’m scared to leave the house even with a mask on. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Outside and masked didn’t cause this spike. Stupidly, selfishness & apathy did. Drama queens who refuse to mask because they think their panic attack is a lack of oxygen but they really, really needed a trip to Walmart. I live here and am surrounded by Covidiots #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	PSA - If you can yell, scream and spit at people, your breathing problem is not an excuse to not wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	People it's really not that hard to be a decent person. We're in the middle of the world in crisis and alot of cleansing is happening. Don't touch people that haven't given you permission, support diversity, and wear a damn mask #Metoomovement #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	People it’s just a mask! It will save a lot of Alabamians. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	People respect you and follow your lead. Please save lives and wear a mask, @realDonaldTrump. Thank you. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	People respect you and follow your lead. Please wear a mask, President Trump. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	People who cant go out without a mask shouldn't go out. Your breathing problem could lead to someone's death. There is plenty of online shopping apps. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Perfect description of how I feel every day when I put on my mask, walk out the door, and have to deal with the reality that almost no else seems to care enough to do their part. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Perhaps your Governor should take a leadership role and mandate masks #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Ping @ottawahealth  Great example set by this store, offering 5% discount to customers wearing masks! #masks4all #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Please explain why @Publix is allowing any employee to work sans mask. It is mandated that masks are required indoors in Hillsborough County.  #MasksSaveLives #MasksAreAMust #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Please wear a mask if you’re going out. Don’t make it political, and if you have respiratory issues that “prevent” you from wearing a mask, then you shouldn’t be going out in the first place. That is all. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Please wear a mask. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	President Trump, people respect you and do what you tell them to do. Please save American lives by wearing a mask in public. Thank you. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Probably one of those people that believe masks will lead to CO2 poisoning. Good riddens!  Keep the facts coming Fran. #FactsSaveLives #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Protesters wearing masks, not linked to virus surges. Beach goers not wearing masks, absolutely linked to virus surge. Arguing otherwise takes a special kind of stupid. Which I expect from Cheeto cultists and intellectually dishonest @GOP #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Put you’re fucking mask on when you address me sir.  #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Raise your hand if you're tired of videos of bearded, backward hat and sunglass wearing, behind the wheel of my lifted diesel (I've got a small penis) pickup rednecks carrying on about a little mask stepping on their rights.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Real men wear masks #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Really is a great video clearly and simply shows the effect of wearing a mask. Thank you for doing this, hopefully a lot more people will now begin to wear a mask and lives will be saved. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Really wearing a mask again... isn’t political.  anymore seems to be an IQ test.  Good lord we’re a stupid country right now. So embarrassing  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Record new #COVID19 cases in FL, GA, SC, NV, AZ (tie) so far today. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Remember when our national media gave equal time to people who thought the polio vaccine was an attack on our freedoms? #COVID19Quarantine #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Right now, anything to encourage #republicans and the #MAGA/#KAGA crowd to #wearamask is a win in my book.  #COVID #coronavirus #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Right...everyone knows Trader Joe’s is the safest place to buy groceries ... everyone wears masks, stays at least 6ft apart and staff are so upbeat and positive no one gets grumpy or rude about protecting themselves and others #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Right? "Climate change is a hoax!" But how? What really would be the gain in someone trying to make the Earth healthier, except a healthier Earth? It's really not all about Al Gore trying to earn a few dollars. Critical thinking is lacking. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Sadly it also affects all those businesses that just re-opened.   For the stupid actions of people, others are paying.  Don’t get me wrong, went to beach & people walking around without masks. Even in bathrooms.   It’s just a tough call now.   #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Sadly, the anti maskers aren’t going to listen to pesky things like logic, reason or science. You’re probably more likely to get them to wear one, if you told them that it stops ‘5G waves’ from passing COVID-19 to them... #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Seeing a lot of “masks are for sheep.” Here’s how #wisdom works. You read the @CDCgov advised us to wear masks to stop the spread of #COVID19. You read data to back it up. Then, out of good conscious, sound mind, & good will for your fellow man, you wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Seems if one has a legit breathing problem, one would wear the mask to reduce the risk of #Covid19.  Even those with previously healthy lungs are suffering after this disease. #Science #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Selfish. I hope you don't kill your kids when you get covid  #COVIDIDIOT #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Seriously, all of you anti-mask idiots, please sign a DNR so you don’t waste the time of medical personnel or take a hospital bed away from one of your victims #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Shame on you #Karen At least the world knows how small minded you are #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	She told on herself at the end. Notice how she went from "I can't wear a mask because I have a health condition" to calling them "sheep" and "f--king liberals" and talking about how there's no virus? It went from medical to political in no time flat. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Since many will not wear a mask to protect others, what if we put some spin on it and emphasize that it protects you? (Cause it’s about me, me, me...) #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Smart move by the #EuropeanUnion #Europe! ...so thankful that hubby is a #Dutch citizen so we can travel if we want or need to  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	So if you wear a mask your a Democrat? Wow grow up sweet we are in a pandemic where over 120k + have died. Think of other people and his or her health. That's what the mask is meant for. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	So, what happens when taking responsibility means wearing a mask to protect the people around you?  Are you really this obtuse? #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Social distancing has devalued my milkshake... but it's still the right thing to do for yourself and more importantly for others. Don't be a selfish git. #SaferAtHome #StrongerTogether #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Some people say "#Masks are for #sheep," but I've met a lot of sheep & not a single one was wearing a mask. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Spent every day of the last month fighting with my crit care team to keep our colleague alive with #COVID19. Was not old. Was not infirm. His lungs gave out and he died this morning. He was one of the good ones. I don’t give a damn about your politics. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Stupid, hateful asshole is not a recognized medical condition that exempts people from fulfilling their civic/public health duty. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Sum of yall NEED a mask on anyway tho #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Sure, sure. Her breathing is inhibited by wearing a mask.   I wonder if her breathing will be inhibited if/when her lungs collapse due to COVID  #COVIDIOTS #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	That sucks. If they have covid,  your chance of getting it is 70%, whilst if you were both wearing masks,  it would drop to 1.5%. Why are people stupid?  #bekind #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	That's great!  Need to send is to the people in Orange County and elsewhere who have been brainwashed into believing this!! #OrangeCounty #COVID19 #Coronavirus #MAGA #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	The Secretary of Dept of Health Levine, is able to enact the 1955 disease prevention & control law which allows for fines to be imposed upon those not complying with the mask requirements. Why are we not doing this as PA's numbers continue to increase? #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	The claims that mask wearing is detrimental are BS. I’ve worn masks (and a full bunny suit) for hours at a time in cleanrooms for years. Drs+nurses wear them for hours at a time in ORs. Hazardous matls workers, same.   Folks making up BS excuses are lying POSs. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	The fact that wearing a mask or not has become a political statement here is so pathetic! Trying to stay safe during a global pandemic isn’t supposed to be POLITICAL!  You idiots people are destroying any hope for humanity! #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	The inventor of the tshirt cannon should also develop a mask cannon. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	The mask is the new “climate change” for the ”science” people #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	The more they resist wearing a mask, the longer they drag this out. I want to be social too but can't take the risk because of my age. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	The only way to get through to the Karens is if someone they loves dies of the #coronavirus. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Then they need to stay out of mandated spaces that require masks. Get delivery. #maskon #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	There goes another #KarensGoneWild at #TraderJoes Damn the woman got some lungs for having a breathing problem. Not all mask wearers are Democrats lol #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	To all of the Christian people who are refusing to wear a mask, what are you going to do if/when  your dumbass refusal causes someone to catch this virus. Last time I checked, that is murder. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	To mask or not to mask, that is the question: Whether tis nobler in public to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous misinformation, Or to take up arms against a sea of viruses And by masking, slow them.  Wear a mask. Please. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	To the people arguing the mandated wearing of masks violates their Covstitutional rights, I’ve got news for you.   Freedom of speech does not allow you to endanger others by yelling “Fire!” in a movie theater when there is no fire.   Also, the 10th Amendment.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	To those living in #Texas, and got the #EmergencyAlert on your phone, do you wear your mask and/or are you wearing your mask currently? If you aren't or don't, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Today I walked 2 miles in the sun with a mask on. It was only near the end that it was hard to breathe, both because I'm out of shape and the mask was damp with my sweat. Y'all can wear a mask for the 30 or so minute shopping trip.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Today I went into the office for work. The first time since March 12th. We three of us work masks for five hours.  I now have an even deeper appreciation for people who have to work full shifts in masks. And people complain about wearing them into a store. Geez. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Too close together for not enough masks. Nevada’s numbers are on the rise. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Trump was conspicuously absent from the Global Citizen Festival. This was all about COVID19, possible therapeutic and vaccine research; philanthropists and most world leaders were there. Where was the #POTUS?  He's such an embarrassment. #TrumpResignNow  and btw #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Unwanted internet fame over a $1 mask. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	We live in a society where laws protect everyone. Wearing a mask protects others. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	We wanted to go somewhere this weekend, even if it was just a car trip to an upstate NYS park. But with cases starting to spike (and no state lives in a bubble!) we are at home. #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Wear a fucking mask!  Learn to sit in discomfort! Unlearn racist bullshit!  Take responsibility for living in a society with others!  #sickofyourbullshit #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	Wearing a mask has nothing to do with politics. It’s a medical precaution that affects everyone regardless of your stupid fucking labels. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It is a showing of respect for those around you who may not be strong enough to survive this stupid thing. That is all. #COVIDisReal #JustWearIt #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Wearing a mask is same like wearing a seatbelt or sunscreen says Red State UTAH Governor.   #MasksSaveLives

20200628	1	Wearing a mask to help protect my immunocompromised wife from catching any illness. Not that hard. Help me protect those I love.   Big signs on store doors, Must Wear Mask to shop here. About 50% of people in store complying. #selfish #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Well it’s about time they take responsibility for their lack of action.  #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Went to Costco, Lowe's and Target today and was astounded by the amount of people I saw lying dead in the streets and aisles from wearing masks and lack of oxygen.  It was literally in the zeros.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	What a nut , we are in a pandemic, look it up in the dictionary Masks are mentioned to protect others from you who may be A symptomatic. #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	What if I told you that the CDC, FDA & WHO have approved a treatment that reduces the spread of Covid-19 to less than 20%? The only known side effect is mild inconvenience. Would you take it?  Great! #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	When did a health crisis turn into a political one?  Anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public (to protect others) is selfish and most likely a Trump supporter.  The virus is an equal party killer.  @realDonaldTrump @TMZ @CNN @CNBC @FoxNews #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Whenever I go out and see someone not wearing a mask, I say:  “You are REQUIRED by the state of California to Wear A Mask .”   Most frequent response is: “oh I forgot.”  . . . you didn’t forget; do yOuR part to help save lives - wear your mask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Which leads me to wonder why cops ticket for not wearing a seatbelt when that only harms the one breaking the law, but they don’t ticket for not wearing a mask, which harms others. @GavinNewsom #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	White woman - it’s got to be said. Maybe it’s not only white people who feel too entitled to wear a mask - but I’ve only seen this kind of outrage from white people. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Why do people refuse to wear masks? Saw a couple of folks on mmy train today withbbno masks or had them but didn't have them covering there bloody mouths. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200628	1	Why wear a mask? Because the majority of people with coronavirus have zero symptoms. So why does this matter if you don't feel "sick"? Well, you would be well enough to be around others, spreading the virus to folks who won't be as lucky. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Will the vast silent majority be alive and well in November if you don’t mandate masks? #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Wonder if all the anti-mask wankers are also against wearing: condoms, sunscreen, seatbelts, insect repellent, helmets... #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Wonder who would be chosen if only 50 people could come to your funeral? Don't wear a mask, don't social distance, don't be cautious, and you'll find out. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200628	1	Would you allow dangerous looking people onto your property? Probably not, and you don't have to. It's your property after all.  Stores are also PRIVATE PROPERTY. You not wearing a mask is dangerous. Gtfo with your excuses.  #MaskUp #NoMaskNoService #NoExcuses #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Wtf is wrong with these mask babies??? #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Yes. Horrific things were reported up here. As a NYer, I admit we're flawed, sometimes gravely, and I tell my elected reps exactly that. We gave up a lot in NY to stop the spread. It's not a shot at Texas. #COVID19 numbers are frightening. Ask your Gov. Abbot. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	You are appreciated. I'm sorry you have to witness so much grief. Pls stay safe.  #MaskOn #MaskUp #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives #WearADamnMask

20200628	1	You can’t see my smile because I care for humanity so I am wearing a mask #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	You know what'd be terrible? If you were having let's say, open heart surgery, and your surgeon refused to wear a mask because it "restricted his breathing." Or if a non-mask-wearing dentist sneezed into your ongoing root canal.  Pretty gross, huh?  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	You must be kidding me!!!! Social distancing please!!!! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Your oxygen levels don’t change with a mask on or without mask on #facts #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	Yup. Unfortunately we didn’t cautiously open or wear masks in Arizona and look at our numbers. How people aren’t getting this is beyond me. #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	Y’all have no idea how shitty people are being about wearing masks. In the service industry I’ve been told to fuck off, shut up, go to hell, etc. I’m in a relatively progressive city in a swing state. I’m just asking you to be decent. Somehow that is an insult.  #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	goddammit....now I have to wear one on my dick as well? (I’ll bet it works like Viagra doesn’t it?) Awesome! I’ll be wearing Two Now then. Good looking out! #WearAMask #SlowTheSpread #COVID19 #FailureInChief #MasksSaveLives
20200628	1	headline: "Making men feel manly in masks is, unfortunately, a public-health challenge of our time" got me thinking, most all clients I've had who was charged with masked robbery had lots of problems, not once did I think that 'not feeling manly' was one of them. #WearADamnMask
20200628	1	lmao your ignorance is making me sick.  I think you need a muzzle as well as a mask.  #MasksSaveLives

20200629	1	I just can’t— I literally just saw this girl I was friends with in hs in FUCKIN NEW ORLEANS W/O A MASK?!?! ew wtf are these girls thinking nowadays.. obvi not about the health and safety of millions and billions of lives!! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I just spent money on masks. #StarTrek for the hubby and #RedSox for me. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I know it's important to you that we all see how pretty you are, but if you wear a mask, I promise to think you are super attractive under it! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I live in Florida and I, along with everyone I know, wear a mask at all times. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I never want to see or hear a mask resistant pro-life person say anything about pro-choice rights.   Seems you don't like when people tell you what you can do with your body huh? #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I officially tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. I swore I had that mess back in late January and now it’s confirmed. I’ve never been that sick in my life, I felt like I was coughing up a whole Juul pod. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I still don't understand why everyone is expecting 'herd immunity' from #COVID19  There are several Coronavirus out there such as the common cold, we've never been able to develop a vaccine or herd immunity.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I think it is time to require masks in public in MN.  This is a simple step we can take to protect each other and to try to prevent turning back the dial on the opening of businesses and other activities. Masks shouldn’t be political.  It’s a global pandemic.  #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	I think its time @realDonaldTrump tells the world what kind of #spraytan he uses that seems to immune him from the #coronavirus when the staff, secret service have been infected. #TrumpIsATraitor #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I too live here in Allegheny County and like you am alarmed we are throwing all the hard work of the last few months. I pray you will be allowed with your wife during delivery.  It’s a life changing event.  #covid19 still here #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I was at Walmart today. Two yahoos NOT wearing masks I pushed my cart away from them right quick! One looked at me like I was nuts until 3 other people did the same thing!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	I was doing the same thing - we must have just missed each other! #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I wear a mask and cut open plastic six pack rings! I'm not bothered! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I wear a mask when I go out. You should too. #staysafe #stayhome #covid19 #maskup #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I wonder how ppl who refuse to wear a mask feel about things like condoms and seatbelts... #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I wonder when we had “Loose Lips Sink Ships” signs up during WWII if there were a bunch of “patriots” going around yelling “WHAT ABOUT MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO FREE SPEECH”. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	I work at a hospital. I have been wearing a mask at work since early April. When it became mandatory for all hospital workers to wear a mask. I don’t understand why people can’t wear a mask when they are out in public. It’s not that difficult. You’re being selfish. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I wouldn’t use the seatbelt analogy for wearing masks. Wearing a seatbelt protects yourself from harm.Wearing a mask protects OTHERS from harm.   If you’re selfish, then nothing is going to convince you. You just need to start giving a shit about other people. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I'm SO ready to see Respect. But the way y'all out here without a mask, who knows if it'll be released in Dec.   Hell, who knows if we'll ever be in a movie theater again  #BETAwards #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I'm so sorry for all that you & your family are going thru. Your uncle deserves better #StayHomeStaySafe #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	IF this clown makes it to November. Refusing to wear a mask over your nose and mouth on a flight is a recipe for contracting Covid.  And yes, definitely voting. Trying to get others to do the same. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If any of the mask rules were really unconstitutional don’t you think there would be court challenges by now, instead of @VP saying follow local ordinances? No more unconstitutional than mandatory seatbelts. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If anyone doesn’t wear a mask because they “can’t breathe with one” (not a real thing), require them to wear a face shield. When they refuse, make it clear then that their refusal had nothing to do with breathing and everything to do with being a selfish a—hole. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If mask wearing doesn’t matter: you avoided a mere annoyance and I’m merely annoyed.    If mask wearing matters: you contributed to the problem and I contributed to the solution.   I like my plan better than yours. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	If one more person tries to tell me that masks don’t do anything so we don’t need to wear them I’m going to scream if they don’t do anything then it doesn’t hurt to wear it correct??? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If we all wear masks this summer, we might actually be able to send our kids back to school in the fall. We might be able to visit our grandparents for Thanksgiving. We might be able to vote in person without risking our lives.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you can scream at the top of your lungs at a retail worker making $7.75 an hour, your lungs are healthy enough to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you do not wear a mask, I take it to mean you prefer one man in the Oval Office over the health of your neighbors, your family, your friends - and yourself. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you don’t wear a mask you will have to homeschool your kids this fall.. hope that helps! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you feel a mask is infringing on your 'freedom,' just wait until you get on a ventilator.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you leave the house, wear a mask until you come back home again. It's not hard and it will save your family and mine. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you think it's uncomfortable wearing a  mask, now imagine all those healthcare  workers wearing them for 50 hrs straight on their shifts. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	If you wear a mask in public, you are helping to protect my 90 year old dad. Be a hero...wear a mask.#coronavirus #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	If you're embarrassed to wear a mask at the grocery store, just remember, when Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time" comes on, you can mouth the words and no one will know. #WinWin #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	If you're not out in public, agreed. No reason to wear one.  I'm referring to the people you state as being "sick and tired" of the masks.  For each one who is sick and tired of a mask, think of how sick and tired people on intubation tubes are of those.  #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	Imagine that you are living in The Last Of Us. There are invisible spores around you that can make you sick or a carrier.  Would you argue about a mask??   #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Irony here being that wearing a mask while actively infected prevents the spread of said infection. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	It is a truth universally acknowledged that any person in possession of good sense, must be in want of a mask. So find a mask that makes you happy, coordinates with your outfit, or speaks your truth and wear it. Please. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	It looks like she is holding a mask in her left hand...? Oh Karen...... calm down and do the right thing. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	It wasn't Mason wide or political as it is today. The San Francisco anti mask society was the largest group resulting in SF experiencing 45k cases.  Wear a mask.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	It's 10 pm. Is it wrong I'm still pissed off that the girl working at our neighborhood Petsmart. She was helping my husband while her mask was around her neck? I motioned to her to put it on. She flipped it up for a second, then right back down again. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	It's a law. The Secretary of Dept of Health Levine, is able to enact the 1955 disease prevention & control law which allows for fines to be imposed upon those not complying with the mask requirements. Look it up. If you don't want to wear a mask, stay home. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	It's so nice to come to FL to help fight COVID19. It would be nicer if I weren't the only one in Jacksonville wearing a mask right now. I hope to hell I don't bring the virus back to my family because of this. #Floriduh #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	It’s not a hard task, just wear a fucking mask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	It’s not only about the 10% that die, it’s about everyone. Masks limit the spread you fucking moron. It’s about how much this spreads. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	It’s unbelievable that so many would willingly put themselves and others at risk because  wearing a mask is inconvenient for them. What happened to doing things for the common good? #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	I’m sick of whining & complaining about wearing a mask  or face covering You say it’s your choice but it isn’t because your actions put everyone else around you in danger The experts are begging you to save the lives of countless Americans not just your own #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	I’m so sorry there are #masklessmorons out there. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	I’ve known people are dumb and selfish. #COVID19 has shown me just how wrong I was. People are terribly more dumb and selfish then I ever thought possible. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	June 29, 2020 New COVID-19 cases: Florida:  5,409 PBCounty:  331 At least they’re going  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Just came from fucking @jimmyjohns in fucking @CarbondaleIL   Did curbside pickup Server came to car with  No Mask & No Gloves!!!  WTF is wrong with leadership in this area?!?!  #JimmyJohnsIgnoresCDC #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Just finished a shopping trip to the Bayers Lake @costcocanada in Halifax. The number of people not wearing masks or wearing them improperly (i.e. not covering their nose, or pulled down below their chin) was appalling.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Just left @Lowes and too many employees (and customers) were not wearing masks while we are under a mandatory mask requirement in #NC. I love you, Lowe's, but do better please!  #coronavirus #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	Just my 2 cents, but if you’ve mastered the ability to insert a tampon or slip on a condom you should be able to figure out how to put your nose inside a mask.   #CoronavirusPandemic #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	Just worked the front end of a central Iowa grocery store. Counted 508 people. 68 had on masks.. #iowa #COVIDIDIOTS #grocery #masks
20200629	1	Listen idiot - because I know you’ve heard it before. The mask is not YOUR protection..it’s protection for the WORLD against you. If you have asthma or other health probs - don’t wear one - but stay the hell away from other people. Please - if able #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Machismo may be stopping (some) men from wearing masks but, based on anecdotal observations at least, there don’t appear to be that many women wearing them either. I suspect the main driving factor is government messaging telling people the threat has subsided.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Makes me sad but not surprised that cases of COVID have increased in Pittsburgh. In medicine people have no choice and mask is required, but community transmission is PREVENTABLE and when out in community and maybe 10% wear masks worked as staff. #COVID #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Mask wear may be a vital factor to Stop COVID-19 transmission  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Mike Pence won’t say #BlackLivesMatter because being pro life, he believes all lives matter. At the same time, he opposes a federal face mask mandate because, hey, it’s a free country. #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	My 90 year old Grandaunt (my maternal grandpa's sister) passed away today of Covid-19. My grandma (also 90 years old) is also with Covid-19 though she seems to be dealing with it rather well, but my family shouldn't be going through this because of your stubborness #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	My SIL, who is 41 and an Army paramedic, is also a Libertarian  He masks to appease my daughter, but I'll bet when she's not around... #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	My daughter just put on a mask to play store in our living room. If she understands and accepts the need to protect herself and others in public places, adults should be able to understand and accept it too.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	My grandmother is in a memory care unit. After 4 months of lock down, they have confirmed a resident has tested positive. NC cases keep going up because 45 has dripped division, hate & anti science since 2016. Very few wear masks here. They are all selfish. #FDT #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	My husband is 77, with many health issues, including previous stroke, I'm 60 with preexisting conditions, my grandson has UC & on a medication that makes him extremely immunocompromised! My daughter is living with us all.WE wear masks, IF we go out, which is rare. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	My nephew asked how people are expected to workout wearing a mask. Simple. You wear it. It doesn't impact my heavy squats so it should affect his weak a**. His main argument was his cardio sucks. Get on that sh*t. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Not one person was wearing a mask where I shop in Canada. #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	Not only Texans should wear a face mask, everybody in the United States should one. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Oh wow! Someone woke up Ben Carson! #SleepyBen #bencarson #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	On a day Texas continues to increase in infections . On a day when Pence even shows up in mask and actually say wears one & still the choir sings without mask WTH Would it not be better to have muffled voices than to possibly spread what is already on the rise.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	One of my first memories is wearing a mask during a different outbreak. If I can wear a mask as a toddler & now again as a young adult, so can you. PLEASE. WEAR. A. MASK.  #COVID19 #coronavirus #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Only kudos I'll give to Trumpster @ScottAdamsSays  and Dilbert:  He actually drew strips with the characters wearing masks. I guess that's something. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Our got shut down too. SO MANY confirmed cases from people who were bar hopping. So disappointing. #WashYourHands #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Our hospital is going to start recycling N95 masks for employees to wear in Covid units. Why is the #PPEshortage still a thing? #fuckcovid #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	PEOPLE OF THE PLANET EARTH, PUT A DAMN MASK ON YOUR FACE &LETS GET THIS PANDIMIC OVER WITH!IM RUNNING OUT OF SHIT TO WATCH &I NEED HOLLYWOOD TO KEEP MAKING SHIT!ALSO IM TIRED OF WIPING EVERYTHING DOWN ALL THE DAMN TIME!JUST WEAR A MASK &KEEP YOUR GERMS TO YOURSELF! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	People should only be made to wear a helmet if they think they have something worth protecting #DarwinAwards Unfortunately the ridiculous mask argument impacts others... #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Perhaps @RonDeSantisFL could act like a leader and order masks to worn in Florida. Unless he thinks it’s a good think that Florida’s numbers continue to go up and are setting records. How many Floridians have to die before he protects us? #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	Person on FB: I’m more afraid of a Democrat in the White House than I am of COVID! Me: Don’t wear a mask and you might not need to worry about November...  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Peter had to go to the Apple store to get his phone fixed, so we were at the Kenwood Mall. It was packed. No one was wearing masks. This is exactly why we’re seeing a spike in cases. Why does it seem that no one cares anymore? #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Please Wear a mask. Another one of my family members who was the age 23, he had kidney disease and he died today from coronavirus complications so please be careful and stay safe #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Please don’t come to Arizona @ChaseRiceMusic. We are running low on ventilators. #CountryFolkAintSmart #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Please wear masks. Stay 6 feet apart. Don’t go out other than for essentials. I’m livid that reckless daycare workers have endangered my family’s lives. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Real people wear masks. Jerks don’t. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	Sadly it’s not all about restaurants.  I had gone to a store recently and saw many who did not have masks on. It’s required as you know here yet nothing was done to these people. I decided I will not support that store.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Same people who won't wear a mask when asked to are the same people who will blame a teacher for their childs behavior. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Save the world with me. Wear a mask. Sanitize your hands. Physical distance not social distance. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	She has a mask in her hand. Put the damn mask on Karen! Damn don't be stupid. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Show you are brave, show you care, and show that you truly understand what it takes to overcome this dark moment...#WearAMask and become the solution! #COVID19 #OurCounty #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	So in other words the rise in cases is due to a rise in people getting the #coronavirus. We got that. Sit down #DiSantis. You’ve done enough damage to #Florida. #COVID #TheVillages #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	So, Rogan. What's up?  #COVIDIOTS #COVID19Quarantine #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Some people:  Wearing a mask makes someone a sheep, And I’m not part of the herd.  Same people: I don’t wear a mask because I’m working on providing herd immunity. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Some reputable scientists maintain that the Coronavirus will infect 70% of all humans on earth. At the moment, a little over 1.3% have been infected. Welcome to the 21st Century. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Someone literally said to me today she wasn’t going to wear a mask because being asked to wear a mask violated her freedom.   Because proving she has freedom is much more important then potentially keeping herself and others safe.  I can’t with people. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Someone messaged me on Instagram saying I need to stop posting things on my story that are “shaming” those who aren’t actively wearing masks because COVID-19 is a hoax made up by the Democrats to get Trump out of office. I hate people  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Someone the other day used the example of "If everyone else jumped off a bridge would you?" for why they WON'T wear a mask, with absolutely no sense of the irony of purposefully jumping off the bridge because no one else is. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Sorry, Batman is the worst example you could ever use to inspire others to wear a mask. How about Spiderman next time?  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Thank you for your sacrifice. It angers me so much knowing what all you front line workers are going through and people can't even bother wearing a mask. I am sorry that people are so selfish and self centered. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Thank you!!!  #GoldenRule #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	That is why Gov. Cuomo took NY with the highest #COVID19 transmission rate to the lowest. Gov. DeSantis uses the opposite approach yielding the highest rate in the country. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	That should be on the entrance to every place of business requiring a mask to get in #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The mask goes over your nose.  #wearamask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The only place I won’t wear a mask is the Mask Store.. You don’t bring food to the buffet! Thanks, I’ll be in quarantine all week. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The only thing about wearing masks that makes me angry is the fact that people not wearing masks can’t see how stupid I think they are.  #StopBeingSelfish #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The only thing our governor has done for us is blame the chinese govt for coronavirus and open the state up way too early #Florida #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The president is anti-mask because he knows the mask would smear his make-up and thousands have died because of it. @realdonaldtrump prioritizing vanity over American lives. #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	The real reason you’re fighting #Masks so hard is your disgusting breath. #covidbreath #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The reason why your state is shutting down cause you hillbillies can’t understand that masks protects others and the more you resist is why you fucks are getting COVID! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The same ppl with conspiracy theories about govt controlling the ppl through masks are the same who willingly mail their whole unique DNA through the mail to get their ancestry information just to show their 3% non-white “ancestry”. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	The tip of the penis has 4,000 nerve endings, the clitoris has 8,000. But neither one is as sensitive as the little pricks and massive vaginas complaining about having to wear a mask.   #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Then wearing a mask in a store, at a rally, at church, on the street, in an airplane, on a bus, etc., protects others, right?  And practicing brotherly love is a Christian trademark, right?  And we’re a ‘Christian nation’, right?  So #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	There is one main thing that wearing a mask as taught me and it is that I am a mouth breather and I hate myself. Truly the only bad part about wearing one though. #WearAMask #WearAMaskPlease #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	This Texas conference on COVID-19 is a farce! #VPPence and #BenCarson strongly advocating WEARING A MASK!......better late than never since the whole #Buffoon administration did not encourage it before! Let’s see #Buffoon wear it! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	This is perhaps the most useful TikTok ever made. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	This is sad. They are trying to stay open, but ignorant people refusing to wear a mask is ruining it for everyone. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	This is why I wear a mask when I leave the house and keep it on until I return home. Not an inconvenience whatsoever especially if it means saving at least one life.  #masksrule #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	This is why respiratory illnesses are extremely common in healthcare workers and other professionals that routinely wear masks. I said it on Twitter so you know it has to be true. #ampfw #MasksAreForSheep #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	This is why we need to be wearing masks. It’s that simple. It isn’t fun wearing masks especially in the summer heat, but it needs to be done so we can get back to normal and start doing the things we enjoy. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Those claiming that their doctors exempt them from wearing a mask don’t have very good doctors or lie about it. I’ve seen a few of my doctors for necessity and both commented on the fact that I was wearing a good mask. I was wearing the n95. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Those same people probably never even heard of the internment camps within the borders of their great America. Hats of to you George and keep spreading the message not the virus  #WashYourHands #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	To all of the people wearing their masks w/their noses out or as chinstraps:  Maybe u JUST don’t want to wear a mask! It DOESN’T work if ur MOUTH & NOSE aren’t covered. Do I need to draw it out for y’all?! THE FUCK!  #COVID19 #Coronavirus #WearAMask #wearitright #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	To be honest now that I know how much wearing a mask works I’ll be wearing one from now on when I go out after the whole Covid19 thing cause me getting the Flu or stomach bug is soooo much harder on my body than a healthy person cause of my Syndrome  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	To everyone bitching abt not wanting to wear a mask bc reasons: I have ptsd from severe sexual abuse as a child and teen..I suck it the fuck up and wear a fuckin mask, not just for me and my compromised child but for everyone else bc I’m not a selfish dick hole. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Trump & his minions whine about how hard #COVID19 mitigations are hitting the economy but their own actions are ensuring that the virus will thrive & spread anyway. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Unpopular opinion: keep them home until they can wear a mask. Sorry Karen, you made it so you need to be responsible for your child’s education. Next time? #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Urgent Reminder   If you're sick with #COVID please make sure to mask your oxygen holes.   Just remember, the main symptom of #COVID is difficulty breathing..you wouldn't want to spread that to someone else.   #maskpeople #masks4all #covid1984 #coronavirus #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	VP said wear a mask- goes to church where they aren’t wearing masks - in TEXAS. Reeling back in Pandora’s box right now is impossible. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Very disappointed to see so many customers without masks  @Hannaford in Standish and no one doing anything about it. #covid19ME #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	Watching Anthony Bourdain No Reservations on Hulu, he found a way to connect wherever he went and make you feel like you were there. #AnthonyBourdain #Hulu #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Watching people getting refused service and banned from business for refusing the wear masks, and doubling down on their stupidity by posting online rants and getting dogpiled, is my new porn. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Watching restaurants close after being open for a short time is so disheartening. Would not be surprised if @GovWhitmer and @DrKhaldun put us in a #timeout this week. Hey Michiganders, #WearAMask. #MaskUpMichigan #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	We are at such low testing numbers, everyone should assume they have the virus and protect one another accordingly.  #TestTraceIsolate #SeroTesting #Masks4All #MaskItOrCasket #MasksSaveLives
20200629	1	We need to stick together and do what's right for each other.  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200629	1	We need to stop amplifying Karen.  Sharon is exemplary and always wears her mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	We've already surpassed MA and PA, soon IL, possibly TX. Outstanding job @GovRonDeSantis So glad you listened to #TrumpTreason and re-opened too soon, not requiring masks, making this all possible. #FloridaCovidEpicenter #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus #WearADamnMask

20200629	1	Wearing a mask but having it below your mouth and nose is like having sex with a condom on your foot. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Wearing a mask during a pandemic is like wearing pants in public. You just gotta wear them. Not necessarily for your own comfort, but mostly for everyone else’s. #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Wearing your mask below your nose is like wearing a condom with a hole in it #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	What are people nagging about. Grow up. Wear a mask. It's not a big deal and you save yourself and others. The faster we all work together, the sooner we can make the economy recover. All you are doing now is making all of this last a lot longer than it should! #WearADamnMask

20200629	1	Why are people so self-centered and think wearing a mask or being asked to wear is the end of the world? The "Karen" videos out there are ridiculous! They are having tantrums like children! #Karen #KarenGoneWild #KarenStrikesAgain #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200629	1	You know, when the Op-Eds start rolling in—and you just KNOW they’re coming—waxing poetic and woe is me-ing, wishing they had realized what an impact masks would have made on their family or themselves or their community, please y’all, do as they did: Ignore it.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	You think people are refusing to wear a mask because they might faint at the smell of their own breath.  #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	Your video was awesome sauce! As a mother to a daughter who is a severe asthmatic and has to use 1 inhaler, 2 nose sprays, 2 pills, a rescue inhaler daily & 4 allergy injections monthly, wearing  a mask can be done & her 02 sat is just fine while wearing the mask! #WearADamnMask
20200629	1	enough with giving the loons who refused to wear masks any air time.  Valley girl's  lungs seem fine.  If she's ailing, let her order groceries on line.  No need to put others at risk.  #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	@LEVIS I went into a Levi’s store yesterday. A clerk wasn’t wearing a mask. She needs to find another job. And Levi’s needs signs on their doors that says they allow employees to work w/o masks. I don’t feel safe shopping at Levi stores anymore. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	@MikeDeWine please consider a temporary mask requirement law when pandemic is above 5% positive for the virus in the state. There’s too many ignoring the need for the mask, selfishly. Our parents could get sick and die b/c of some Karen.  #COVID19 #pandemic #COVID #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	Even if a mask is not required you should be wearing one right now.  The coronavirus respects your Constitutional rights less than Donald Trump does, if you can believe that.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Fix News probably support this seeing as they're not wanting to know about COVID-19 and going for political opponents and not facing the coronavirus head-on earlier on in the year and #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	For those of you who don't/won't wear masks-once people are getting sick-it's too late. Your regret because you know you bear some responsibility, will mean nothing to those who spend months/years in recovery or worse, to the families / loved ones of those who die. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Franklin Co's a joke too. Not only are half the people I see sans mask, they don't try to keep a distance. I'm high risk & have to dodge & weave to avoid them. People act like they're being asked to sacrifice kidneys. Caring for each other shouldn't need a mandate. #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	I don’t get why many are willing to gamble with others lives so they can go to a bar or eat dinner out. Has our ability to look past our own gain been lost? We have a attention span of a gold fish with its tiny brai.... oh look, shiny things! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	I don’t understand the conflict with wearing a mask? Yes it’s uncomfortable- just wear it. We put on bras everyday so that our tits don’t sag to the ground and that shit is way more uncomfortable than any damn mask that can protect your health! #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	I flew on @AirCanada last Friday between Toronto and Halifax (approx) 2hr  everyone was wearing masks and middle seats were empty. It was fine. Not sure what it will be like when I fly home in a month though. Too soon to open up? #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	I would like to suggest “Selfish Asshole” stickers that we can slyly put on the backs of those refusing to wear masks where mandated.   #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	I wouldn't say I like wearing a mask but I wear one, up to 12 hrs/day. I like to mix it up with different patterns. People sometimes say 'I like your mask', that's nice but when it's someone I know are they really saying 'I don't like your face?' I my friends. #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	If all of us that wear masks when we go out stop taking showers for a few weeks, the folks that won't wear masks will be incentivized to begin wearing masks as a way to avoid our collective odor.  Thoughts?  #MaskUp #MaskUpAZ #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	If everyone wore masks indoors and in tight areas outside we wouldn’t need to close down. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	If masks are to limit droplets from infecting others, what is the argument for not wearing them below the nose? #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	If more people wore face coverings then maybe we won't have another lockdown. It seems like the anti-mask people are going to cause things to shut down & they're the "knuckleheads", to quote Governor Murphy. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	If the kids “don’t want to wear masks” then don’t put them back in activities. Don’t reopen the schools. Don’t bring them to restaurants and grocery stores. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	If u have breathing problems so bad u can’t wear a mask, u should be on oxygen. U CAN be a CO2 retainer if u have COPD—however u would be on oxygen and staying tf home as a high risk individual. She can shout in full sentences w/o taking a breath. She’s lying. #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	In PA MASKS are mandated, required, essential, a must...how many other ways do we need to say it before everyone understands you do NOT have the RIGHT to potentially kill or be killed? #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	In two years we will be crying over videos and photos of turtles stuck in disposable masks. Of course, there will be hashtags! #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Instead of having time to counsel my patient struggling with dying father, I had to rush 2 c healthy folks 4 #Covid_19 rapid testing so they can get back to living. Another way pandemic is crushing #primarycare hurting patients who need us the most. #TexasCovid19 #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Is anyone shocked that the USA ranks Gold for Covid cases as people refuse to wear masks, cite Constitution Rights like its this blanket of hope until you test positive (Spoiler Founding Fathers didn't factor in Covid) @realDonaldTrump is useless #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	It is disheartening to realize that the last three months in quarantine were only the beginning and we have to start over in this second wave. We truly learned nothing from enduring the plague in 1918. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	It's a good thing the Greatest Generation is dead and can't see that only a couple of generations later, you people refuse to wear a simple mask. They fought a war because it was the right thing to do, and you can't even wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	It's about respecting and protecting...  ~ John Tory, Mayor Of City of Toronto.   #staysafe #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	It's amazing how other states with higher numbers, as well, can influence the governors to close some places, again, esp. when some of us wonder why they had a partial opening so early in the first place #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	It's becoming chic to wear face masks. Those of you who aren't, are a bunch of 's (and selfish assholes.)   #WearADamnMask #CoverYourFreakinFace #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives

20200630	1	Its 97 degrees here in NC today. And wearing a mask was pretty miserable. BUT! I wore one the whole time I was out, because I'm not a fucking asshole. And I want to go back to work sometime this century. #Broadway #broadwayshutdown #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	It’s June 30th. I chose to go on lockdown earlier, it’s been since the middle of February for me. I’m wearing a mask any time I’m inside. I don’t like wearing them, no one likes wearing them but in order to eradicate this virus #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	It’s because they started promoting tourism. “WE’RE OPEN!” Yeah, well, we shouldn’t be. The only way to slow the spread is social distancing and wearing masks. Time to dial back to save lives. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	I’ve only been in a store like 4 times since February. Today was one of those times, and MFers really out there not wearing masks. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Just remember, folks...if you don't wear a mask, you might end up getting sick and/or getting other people sick. And if you give the virus to someone who is immunocompromised (like me), you've basically murdered them.  #dontmurderpeople #murderisbad #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Just saw a guy try to walk into Starbucks with no mask on. He got to the door, saw the sign saying you can’t come in without a mask, rolled his eyes and threw his head back and walked back to his car. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Just saw that vid, omg, so good. I’m glad he was wearing a mask in public too. If Jason can do it, you can too! #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	Live in #Oregon and pissed off you'll be required to wear a mask? Here's who to call to complain: someone you know who hasn't been wearing a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Look at it this way... no one can smoke in bars, offices, restaurants and airports because secondhand smoke can kill you slowly, over time!  If we both wear masks, it keeps us safe inside and out, from something that can work faster than secondhand smoke.  #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Mandate. Don't recommend. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	Masks are now a fashion accessory. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Masks are still mandated in PA thanks to @GovernorTomWolf. Sounds good, right? Pffft! Since we went green, less than half the people I see in stores, etc have masks. They're permitted into stores & businesses anyway. Hope Tarrant Co has a better compliance rate. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Masks, tracing and quarantine has been used in the US for over a century.  Nobody has the right to expose others with a deadly virus. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Memorial Day reopening results. No mask or #SocialDistancing. Now, July 4th is going to suck for everyone.   Wait a couple of weeks to see the results of protesters.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Most definitely. Wearing a mask isn’t about protecting you, it’s about protecting others - and ending this pandemic.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	My city finally did something right! As of 5:00pm masks will be mandatory in Duval County. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	My mask just saved me from a bee sting too the face #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Next time you hear someone complain that putting on a mask is a violation of their right to do what they want with their body, ask them what their opinion on abortion is. When they go into a diatribe about the sanctity of life, glue a mask to their fucking face. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	No, morons like you who don't give a shit about the people around you are the #COVIDIOTS   Just STFU and #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Not being told to “smile more” in the past 4 months because I’m wearing a mask has been the BEST thing about this quarantine. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Not sure why people are having such issues wearing masks. They help us protect each other, and today I was called Miss by a store clerk while wearing one, so Win Win! #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Nothing `lovely` about this criminal! She should have been arrested. #WhitePrivilege #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Notice how all of a sudden leaders are all "we really gotta wear masks, folks" but it took over 120,000 American deaths before they gave a fuck. We saw that.  We won't forget that.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	One more thing (I should never say /end!) Masks are ONE added layer of protection on top of hand hygiene, physical distancing, not touching your face/eyes while out interacting more in the world! #COVID19 is still a threat - Be Safe.  #ProtectTheEconomy #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Originated with 'fearless leader' of course. "It's just not for me." said trump.  But is the about face because of the fear that 'the Dems' wearing masks will vote and the repubs not wearing them will be too sick to vote?  #TrumpRallyFail #TrumpIsKillingUs #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Over 40. Overweight. Overactive asthma. Yet I manage to wear a P95 mask everywhere I go w/out any discomfort. I'm tired of these entitled little babies complaining. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Participate in a Democratic country. Choose a vote, then vote for the opposite party. Don't be racist. Wear a mask! #Covid_19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	People think wearing a mask is all a joke because these people haven’t had a chance to feel the pain of Covid-19. They need to experience what is like having this virus before they start wearing one. #feelthepain #COVID19 #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	People who don't want to wear a mask and think #COVID19 is no big deal HAVE NEVER DONE SO MUCH COUNTER RESEARCH! Those DuckDuckGo tabs are going on FOR DAYS!! All because they can't be bothered to have a small piece of cloth over their mouth and nose. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	People who stand in the middle of narrow things in public and bottleneck walkways and bridges (especially when not wearing masks) it should be allowed to kick them in the shins  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Pics with the mask or it ain't true. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Please, please, please wear a mask.  If you or a loved one gets sick, remember you might be sequestered, ALONE,  in a hospital for weeks before you see them again. If you get to see them again.  Please think about that.    #WearAMaskPlease
20200630	1	Poor mask discipline  Poor hygiene Poor physical distancing  #coronavirus #MasksSaveLives

20200630	1	Recently it was Pence lying his way through the Covid-19 update. @VP congratulating himself. Disgusting. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Remember the historic nonsmokers rights campaign? My right to breathe clean air wins over your right to smoke in public places. Applies to the politicized mask debate today. #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	SO ironic. The same people that whined about re-opening and refuse to wear masks are the VERY reason why we're shutting back down. The stupidity would be hilarious if it wasn't so deadly. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Shakespeare said: yea i sw'rn completeth vengeance 'gainst the ones who is't has't soil'd the lands with this plague. Deadly of all foes.  I shalt don mine own visage mask in a and i shalt beest apart of thy solution to cureth sir kind.   Weareth thy visage mask. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	She doesn't want to wear a mask?! Is it because she hasn't brushed her teeth for so long, she would literally risk death and the lives of others just so she wouldn't have to smell her own breath?   #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Should be mandatory viewing for everyone,  please  wear a mask in public until this pandemic is over.  We can never let this happen again in our country #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Shout-out to the guy leaving Tesco this morning...  Mask?  Sanitised hands?  Hacking cough?  Spat out phlegm?   It's gonna be a long summer.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Sickening, literally and actually. #TrumpCovid + #COVIDIOTS =  #COVID19 only getting worse.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	So @RandPaul wants optimism. Here's optimism. Wear a f****** mask and will be able to open the economy back up.  Wear a f****** mask and kids will be able to go back to school.  Wear a f****** mask and we'll be able to have sports again.  #WearAMask #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	So happy the #GOP macho men, including @VP, @senatemajldr, & #dickcheney, are on board with mask recommendations [checks calendar] nearly 3 months later. Now, will the rest of you join them?  #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	So if I wear two masks that's a 140% efficiency rating?  **praying he doesn't smite me has worked so far...  #COVID__19 #coronavirus #masks #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	So many Russian bots and Trump Zombies, you may think this COVID-19 is just a "hoax" or "fake news" from the left, it is NOT, think about your families and communities who are at risk #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Sorry...just cherry picked nonsense.  On Feb. 27th, South Carolina he rallied it a "democrat hoax".  Remember "liberate, Michigan"??  He's a moron's moron.    #VoteJoe #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Sounds good but don't forget to take your promo photos with a mask on. Set a good example, please. #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Stop blaming #governors for your state being shut down again or the reopening being delayed. Blame the selfish asshats sitting on the barstool next to you without a mask on. Blame those who made wearing a mask #political. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	THANK YOU, Governor Brown! This is something we desperately needed, and I hope to see more people complying and keeping our communities safe. Folks, wearing a mask is literally the least you can do to protect the people around you, so please do it! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Thank you for making masks mandatory for visitors, I hope other museums and galleries will follow suit  #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Thank you for sharing this mask information.  I hope lots of people read it and decide masks are safe and needed. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Thank you for your leadership, @GovTimWalz . Now please mandate masks in #Minnesota. Help keep us safe! #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	That would be great. Anytime now. Also, let's all mask up while we're waiting. #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	The County of Jacksonville should join with the City of Jacksonville, FL and mandate masks. #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	The mask message is painfully simple:  You can infect others with COVID before you have any symptoms yourself. Wearing a mask and keeping your distance can save them.  #BeAMensch #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	The same people who didn’t(and still don’t)want to wear the damn masks, are the ones already complaining about bars closing again. Please just #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	The virus does not care if you are old, healthy, sick or stupid... where the mask. It’s not a political issue it’s a health issue #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	These will be the same people that complain when a 2nd lockdown becomes necessary.... #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	This pandemic truly proves who is caring and thoughtful of their fellow human beings. I have next to no immune system right now (stem cell transplant) so thanks to all wearing masks. To all who refuse, you are selfish scumbags. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	To mask or not to mask is NOT the question! Wear a mask dammit! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	To my 15 followers.   Wear a mask. Stay inside. Stay safe.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Too bad #HydroxycloroquineDon hasn’t had #DrFauci briefing us daily instead of the political spin coming from #WH . #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath #WearADamnMask

20200630	1	WHO says that Covid-19 is still accelerating, and there's no foreseeable vaccine. And recommen's  personal hygiene is still the best way to suppress the virus.  #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Wake up people, protesters were wearing masks, and they are outside. You can't drink at a bar and wear a mask. Stay home & drink  #WearTheDamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Walking through @TableBayMall today really got me wondering. How long will it take for clothing manufacturers to start selling masks suited with specific outfits? If masks are here to stay then having matching masks would be ideal #CoronaVirusSA #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Was there this much resistance to seat belts? #MasksNow #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Watching #MSNBC and it’s like reruns from March. Medical front line workers explaining the horrors of their jobs in hard hit states... 100% preventable.  #ICantEven #COVID19 #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #preventable #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Watching Sunday’s episode of #Snowpiercer . Kid gets sick and everyone quickly puts on a mask to prevent catching or spreading the disease. Huh... even post-apocalyptic dystopian fiction gets it. #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	We going on lockdown again. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	We probably over indulged over the past 120 days, we probably worried a lot over the past 120 days.  Wearing a mask will cover up a fat face, new wrinkles, and #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Wear a mask! Jesus faced an adulterous generation and now America has a murderous one. When being an example saves lives, young people, #Trump, #Pence, and other fools are killing their own by refusing to wear masks. Repent! Pride leads to #judgment. #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Wearing a mask  is easier than wearing a ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Wearing a mask in public should be a federal mandate.  It is the only way we are going to get the selfish irresponsible MAGA morons to wear a mask.  Once upon a time Americans cared about each other but that was before Trump. #WearYourMaskFL #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Wearing a mask is a no-brainer. Unfortunately, too many people appear to have no brains. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	We’re deciding what to do when folks won’t mask up in our condo building. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	What the heck... it's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine... #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	What's the difference from wearing a seat belt  to save lives and wearing a mask to save lives?  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	What’s crazy to me is the proudly maskless take it as an affront to their liberty to be told “no mask, no entry” but why not the same ire for the longstanding policy of “no shoes, no shirt, no service”?!?! #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	When AIDS hit when I was a youth, I wrapped myself in a condom before sex. So yah, #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	When I was out for a run, I saw a guy in a mask walking  and carrying a coffee cup and I swear, he was so adorable.  Masks make you attractive! #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Who are you to decide that it's OK to walk around carelessly infecting others with #COVID19 leading to the deaths of beloved human beings? Are you 100% positive God is OK with you playing God? #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Why don't you tell your base that wearing a mask is NOT a liberal hoax? #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Why is it so hard to understand the mandatory mask mandate in Elkhart county? #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Why not mandate masks? Leave politics out of it and listen to science. Increasing covid cases daily is no win. Protect the people, limit spread #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Wow. 100% of people on the X22 wearing a face mask. Miracles take a little longer #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Yes exactly! Common sense that people sitting close to each other in enclosed spaces without masks are naturally going to have much higher spikes than masked outdoor protestors. #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Yes, I know you want me to move back to #NYC ~ if I stay in #Florida any longer, I'll be dead ~ let alone still #quarantined after 17 weeks #COVID19 kills ~ #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Yes.  I understand. Whether it's a vaccine or a treatment doesn't change the fact that in one instance companies seek to profit off of misery and in another a gift was given to humanity. And yes, #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Yes. If u die at home without a test, your not counted. If u die in hospital without a test u died from pneumonia. If you elderly u died of natural causes. #covid19undercount #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Yes... I am sorry but yes. We have No Shirt No Shoes no Servive and nobody bitches so why not add no mask and a heavy fine if you don’t wear one #MasksSaveLives
20200630	1	Yo where's the #gotmask campaign y'all?? Like you were all "DRINK MILK!!! IT DOES STUFF." In the #90s #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	You know #ItsAGoodDayWhen you experience your first real life #karen in the wild. At food truck rally Karen got mad because she didn’t have a mask & they wouldn’t take her order. Screamed “it’s outdoors why do you need one?” Because you’re in their face to order? #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	You mask-free #covidiots that are running rampant having a tantrum all need to get Covid now to STFU.  You will be 2 sick to complain about the economy stopping again.  At this rate, the California experiment has failed.  There is NO controlling the virus. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	You need to extend that order to everyone inside city and county like Chattanooga did. Masks should be required by everyone. #Covid_19 #Covid19isGettingCloser #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	You would think that US conservatives, who claim to be prolife, would be pro- face mask. But no, the "mah freedumb" people can't be bothered to wear them...... #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200630	1	Your ability to go out to dinner, to go to parties, and to make a ridiculous political statement by not wearing a mask, is not more important than getting kids back to school in the fall. Also, you are possibly harming vulnerable people around you-so there is that. #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Your mask is upside down. I’m still here for ya though. #WooPig #WearADamnMask
20200630	1	Your message is great! Mask has to cover your nose: be careful! #MasksMoreComfyThanVentilator #MasksSaveLives

20200630	1	people that say wearing masks is an infringement on individual rights are full of crap! What they don’t have is the right to arbitrarily infect or kill someone else! This isn’t a political issue.. it’s an issue of intelligence or lack of #MasksSaveLives
20200701	0	"no mask, no service"? I hate that. I will never wear a mask. idgaf. Masks DO help, I agree. Those that want to or need to wear them, that's totally fine. Those like me that don't need to or don't wish to wear them shouldn't be feared or hated on. #NoMask #NoMasks

20200701	0	Masks are ineffective and are the Dems equivalent of the MAGA hat.  Judging by how moronic Biden has become from rebreathing his CO2 I'll skip the mask. #NoMasks

20200701	0	Rumor has it that @GovAbbott is going to institute a statewide mask mandate for Texas. It would be a HUGE mistake. I’m already ticked about Tarrant County. People are going to be livid if this goes into place.  #MasksOffAmerica
20200701	0	The mask thing perfectly illustrates the difference between the left and right.   Right: your CHOICE-wear a mask if you want to.   Left: because we think it's good for you, you WILL wear a mask or the government will find you, fine you and jail you.   #masksdontwork
20200701	0	To everyone demanding masks be made mandatory - ask yourself why, in a country like China where wearing masks is the norm, the death toll was so high?  Maybe because #masksdontwork

20200701	1	#COVID19 isn't a political disease. It's not in red or blue states, it's worldwide. People not following CDC guidelines will have more infections. State officials are calling the shots. You know Miami's mayor is GOP. You think he's in a conspiracy? #WearAMaskPlease
20200701	1	#Maddow  I need for someone to please explain to me why wearing a mask is such a political thing?? It makes not sense to me MAGA ppl. I dont care if you don't care about getting coronavirus but I care about myself & my loved ones so I'm going to #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	.@RandPaul is such a dick. These Republicans are so anti - everything and refusing to be part of the solution. They’re entire existence consists of bitching and whining. Instead of “What can we do to get to these next steps to make sure we can open the schools”? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	1. You don’t have a right to infect others 2. Do you wear a shirt and shoes to get service because wearing a mask is no different and I don’t hear you whining about not being allowed to shop naked.  #SuckItUp #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	1268 new cases of #COVID19 in #BexarCounty in ONE DAY?!? That is RIDICULOUS and unacceptable!! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	1st racist assholes cried All Lives Matter. Then they cried That Flag is our Heritage. Then came I won't wear your damn Mask. Now today in Texas its Bar Lives Matter. WTF is wrong with these fucking idiots??? #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	200,000+ Americans will die of #COVID19 because @realDonaldTrump doesn't want to smudge his make-up. #25thAmendmentNow #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	@ChrisCuomo yes governers really need to mandate these masks for those Trump supporters who aren't wanting to wear masks,it's so simple #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	@CuomoPrimeTime Dear Chris, @realDonaldTrump can not wear a mask because it will turn orange of all the orange make up he is wearing. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	@DollarGeneral How do you explain not requiring your employees to wear masks? What right do your employees have to put my life in danger? #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	@FedEx why are your ground drivers running around Chicago with no masks and entering businesses that require masks? This is extremely problematic and they are rude when called on it. Unacceptable #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	@FoxNews Still think that Covid-19 is a hoax?  You are complicit.  Tell your viewers to #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	@GovMikeDeWine won’t mandate masks either. Not even in state offices we HAVE to go to. It’s unsafe for Ohioans. At least require masks in state agencies we have no choice but to use. Courts. Bureau Motor Vehicles. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	@realDonaldTrump If you’re worried a mask will ruin your make-up (or spray tan - whatever it is, no judgment) just ask your make-up person to use some “setting” spray - any brand - it really works. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	@seanhannity ~ thanks for telling your viewers you believe in wearing #masks & doing so, would open up our fav past-times, #baseball, #football, #concerts ~ can you whisper that in #POTUS ear so he'll change the trajectory of his campaign? #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	A Respiratory doctor did a rest with 3 people put Oxygen Monitors on them after 2 min got them to put on a mask & have them wear it for five minutes while wearing it & there was NO FUCKING CHANGE in there levels!  SO SHUT THE FUCK UP & wear A FUCKING MASK!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	A bus I was in once slid off the edge of the road and started tumbling down the slope of a mountain! I got tossed out through the window and hit a tree and fainted, but my mask got caught in a branch and held me there until the medics came. #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	All I can say is there’s lots of companies making really pretty masks that match my summer outfits & it’s fun to show up having the best coordinated mask in the [necessary reason to leave my house] place. If you refuse masks you have no taste. Period. #Maskup #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	All these people screaming “they should’ve complied!” about police brutality won’t comply with wearing a mask...  #MaskUp #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	All these people who say it’s “unconstitutional” to be forced to wear a mask need to rethink their logic. Legally you have to wear clothes in public or you will be arrested for public indecency; which doesn’t even have the potential to kill someone. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Also: wear a mask goshdarnit! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Am masking for a friend. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	At least they are wearing a mask! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Bar Lives Matter? No, human lives matter. A lot of us will die because Republicans won’t test, social distance or wear masks (witness their Trump rallies). Maybe demand your leaders wear masks, social distance and contact trace? Then we can re-open without dying. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Barefaced in public? You might as well appear bare assed in public. That is how you look to others who are wearing a mask to keep their germs confined.  You on the other hand are free to pee on the brocolli if you like. How pathetically stupid. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Better late than never.  Go preach this loud & clear. Please don’t fold to the administration if it isn’t right for the people of our country. You can’t change the past of the pandemic but the future can be imoo point acted by your actions now. #facemask #CoverYourFace

20200701	1	Blanket mask wearing is the only thing that will allow us to successfully get the economy going again. No masks mean longer and further closures and more out of work. No masks=no slowing the spread. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	COVID 19 MASK CHALLENGE! Oh this will be super fun! If you really and truly believe that masks don't help, that's ok. If you ever have have to have a surgical procedure done, just tell the doctors they don't have to wear masks. -_- They don't work...right?? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Can we agree that any gathering, large or small, requires a mask?  Driving from Austin to Houston 290/91 last weekend was not pleasant.  Gas station/grocery store/public park in more than 1 town, < 1/3 of persons in crowds were wearing masks. #uncomfortable  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Can you imagine, kiss ass boy, what a difference it would have made if your idiot king president had one iota of  common sense or civic responsibility to put on a damn mask three months ago? Stop preaching to the choir and make trump #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Can you please state publicly that there are no medical conditions that preclude wearing a mask? Can you also have someone state that is not against your rights to mandate wearing a mask? #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	Costco I know how fucking hard is to enforce the use of masks inside your huge stores but you need to do a better job.  I was just at #Costco Van Nuys CA and several customers were not wearing masks. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Covid-19 is a respiratory disease and you can protect yourself and others by wearing masks. Just like you wear condoms as protection from sexually transmitted diseases. It’s the same principle. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Dear @HarrisTeeter, what customer do you want to piss off more? The responsible shopper who wears a mask or the selfish one who doesn't? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Dear @realDonaldTrump  I've heard @BarackObama doesn't believe in masks and is telling his supporters NOT to wear masks. You should wear one just to spite him. That'll really show him what's up. #maskswork #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Dear Mayor. As a Hamilton resident AND a local restaurant worker - I BEG of you - MAKE MASKS MANDATORY! In just 2 weeks of being open...I have seen the MAJORITY  with the very obvious attitude that this pandemic is over and that masks are a joke. Act now-PLEASE!!! #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Dr. Fauci: 40,000 cases a day now and could go to 100,000 if we don't do more.  We need national leadership for prevention and we're not getting it.   #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Due to how poorly our president, government, and own citizens that refuse to wear damn masks handled the coronavirus pandemic it’s not whether if we get the virus it’s just a matter of when. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Effect... “Lone Warrior” where’s your mask? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Eight THOUSAND NEW cases of coronavirus in California TODAY.   Just today.  There were new 40,000 cases in our nation today.  This thing is NOT under control.  #StayHome #WashYourHands #SocialDistance #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Even more reason to stay the hell away from Trump supporters because they’re all hotspots for the so called hoax Covid. #trumpcovidfest #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Every few days I think maybe I'll go out with my daughter.  If I wear a mask and social distance I'll be fine, right?  Then I see posts by people who do everything right and still catch the virus and nope!  My lungs are shit*ty, I am not risking it!  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Every time I put on a mask, my nose automatically itches. Still wear it, though. Minor inconvenience beats a major illness every day. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Fellow Rhode Islander! I haven't seen people without masks here in Johnston, Warwick or Coventry. Let's keep it going!!  #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	For the record, every literal a**hole is wearing a mask out in the public, it's called pants. That non-mask wearing metaphorical a-hole can take his comment running piehole and put a lid on it!  #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Good morning everyone!  Look at all the GOPers touting wearing a mask!  Must have read their latest poll numbers.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Governor Ricketts doesn’t care if you die of Covid-19. He thinks wearing a mask, proven to help prevent the spread of the virus, is just a political statement so you are FORBIDDEN from requiring citizens to wear one. What a total idiot. RIP #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Governor’s from the tri-state area are requiring self-quarantine for travelers from Idaho. How the tables have turned, we are now the hot spot. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Grateful for every prayer!! It is chaotic here. The lack of caring from fellow Texans toward fellow Texans boggles my mind. Home Depot employees making a conscious decision not to wear a mask?..what the HELL? Sincere  to all who choose life over *stupid*.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Great point! If these people who won’t wear masks were rational we wouldn’t have to ask  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Growing up I was told to pick my battles wisely. This  would be an example of not picking your battles wisely. This virus is out of control and your concern is "liberty". Did you fight this hard to be able to text while driving? #coronavirus #TrumpFailedUsBigly #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Guys my face mask looks like a banana hammock and I still wear it 100% of the time. And the only thing I got going on under there is my baloney nose. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Ha, funny.. how is wearing a mask during a pandemic a problem? #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	He sprays his face daily for vanity, looking like a clown. He wouldn't put a mask on his face to show leadership, doing one of the few things that can actually save lives. Mr President you are a disgrace!  #WearAMask #realDonaldTrump #COVID #COVID19 #CDC #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	Hey, anti-maskers: Do you think a plastic ventilator mask in ICU is more comfortable than a cloth mask in a store and other public places? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Holy Sh*t you're such a lightweight! #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Honest question. If that's so why have you sworn off masks & never asked Americans to wear one? We're getting beaten up by your dumbass redneck followers who think it's a violation of their liberties.  For once, do the right thing. It won't hurt your ego, honest.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	How difficult is it to wear a mask in public? People are so dense! It’s a pandemic, wear it while you’re in public!   Do you really want stay-at-home orders again?   #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	I am committed to supporting local business.  That said,  our local farmstand isn’t enforcing the mask regulations, so that’s a no go for me. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I am tired of watching grumping old men refuse to wear mask #pandemic #WearYourMaskFL #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I can’t believe that America is actually still debating the use of masks. Years of libertarian, anti-government intervention, anti-expert rhetoric have removed any hope of sensible reactions. So incredibly depressing. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I do not go out with out a mask. Period  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I don't even like shopping and I miss being able to get in the car and go any time.  If everyone wore a mask and stayed home we could be though this! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I don't understand how people can willingly walk into a store without a mask on a not feel weird. I hate them but we gotta do what we gotta do! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I don’t get ppl’s issues with face masks. I, for one, am obsessed. They come in different shapes & sizes, colors & fabric types. Plain ones & fancy ones & most under $15/each + a majority are made by small business individuals. Oh, and it saves lives. So... #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I don’t understand how wearing a mask could POSSIBLY be a political issue… here’s a debate for you: do you want more or less people to die?  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I had a dream last night that we had a vaccine,  and I got  one. Damn it felt real, felt freeing....until then #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I have a feeling there will be a lot of #COVID19 transmission over July 4th weekend. Many people don't seem to have any self-control. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I have a list of things that I want to do too, but at the top of my list of things I don’t want to do is ACCIDENTALLY KILL SOMEONE I KNOW AND LOVE. #coronavirus #Quarantine #chill #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I have asthma and am in a mask 9 hours a day working as a nurse. Stop bitching, if you don’t like the sensation of a mask, you’re really not going to like the ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I have asthma. It's been hard to breathe forever. Wearing a mask doesn't make it harder. It means I care. It means I'm a responsible man and not a whiny dick.  #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	I hear so many runners say, "But I can't run properly without a mask".  If that's the case, then don't run. But don't potentially dump your viral load on the path where you run so the next un-masked idiot can pick it up. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	I was originally of the opinion that masks were pointless in saving yourself from corona. I quickly changed that opinion once I saw the statistics. Now, every member of my family wears them to stay safe. It’s okay to change your opinion when presented with facts. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	I wish it was mandatory from day one. But in the beginning the virus was stated as being low risk and masks don't help.  Wrong on both counts. I'm not sure why ppl are complaining about wearing one??   #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200701	1	I would've liked him to NOT fire the pandemic response team in 2018. I would've liked him to make sure CDC in China to be well staffed. I would've liked him to LISTEN to IC & WHO & respond effectively. I would have liked him to quarantine ALL international flights #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I'll say it again: the greatest threat we face in this fight against #COVID19 is running out of resources. The death rate will skyrocket! We're all connected! If don't care if kill your neighbor, then don't care if kill yourself! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I'm a healthcare worker who has to get Covid tested every week. I switch off between having the swab shoved down my throat and peeing my pants or having what feels like a hot knife up my nose and twisted. WEAR A FUCKING MASK, I'M TIRED OF THIS SHIT!! #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	If 1,000 people got randomly sucker punched when they left their house in your town would you feel comfortable leaving your house?  What if the only way to NOT get sucker punched was for everyone to wear a cloth mask over half their dumb faces?  #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Inside all but one business that I've been to the within the last several days, I've seen at least one person not wearing a mask, even though it is still a requirement and there are signs everywhere saying so. Enjoy your second wave, western New York.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Instead of calling them masks, what if we referred to them as border walls for your face? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	It's already been determined masks help reduce the chance of getting COVID-19, so I don't really understand anyone's protest of putting a mask on when they go out in public...Take it from someone who has seen it first hand, this is not just a flu folks...#WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	It's not political to wear a condom. Why is it political to wear a mask?  #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	It’s about time FOX and GOP “leadership” got on board with wearing masks.   It’s just sad that it has more to do with losing their jobs than the deaths of nearly 130,000 Americans.   Can’t wait to see how Trumpsters respond.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I’m so tired of living in a country full of idiots. Stay home (unless you have to work) and/or wear a mask. It’s not that hard. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I’ve been working from home since mid March. Yesterday we heard that it could be sometime next year when we go back. Working from home with kids is tough but I’m grateful to be safe, at home & working for a company that isn’t taking chances. #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	I’ve fking HAD it with the anti-mask people. What a selfish bunch of babies we’ve become. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Just came back from a grocery store that, according to their website, requires masks to enter and shop. Other than employees I was the only person (out of about 20) to have a mask on. Wtf is wrong with this world? #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Just wait. If Trump starts touting wearing a mask, Trump supporters will be like "masks save lives!". #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	LA had 6,000 new cases . We need to slow the transmission of covid. We are going the wrong way. We are banned from entering EU borders. Can someone in the higher ups mandate if we don’t wear masks in public we get heavily fined? Giving us the option is not working. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Lord.....#SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	MASKS DEOXYGENATE THE BRAIN  #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	Masks don’t cause oxygen levels to drop. See also: surgeons performing surgery with masks for hours. See also: face shields.  Stop making your little 20 minute trip to the store a bigger deal than it needs to be. Stop fighting what is clearly right. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Masks save lives! MAGAts for all their talk of loving our great country, and patriotism don’t give a flip about keeping their fellow Americans safe! #hypocrites #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Maybe we need to get @GovRicketts in an stuck elevator with someone who is coughing and see if he thinks wearing a mask is still not the right thing to do in a pandemic?! #Maddow #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	More and more I think about it: pick your nose and eat it. #COVIDー19 #COVID19 #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Most Twitter Users: Wear your mask it protects everyone.   Most Facebook Users: I can breath in it... what about my freedom... I got a fake card.... this isn't as bad as the flu....STOP BEING SHEEP!!! #coronavirus #WearYourMaskFL #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Must be psychosomatic.  At my Docs two weeks ago my O2 on room air was 94% after wearing a mask for a couple of hours.  With my asthma it is normally 93-96%.  Put on a damn mask.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	My experience traveling so far:   Incheon Airport: Temperature checked before checking in and before boarding. Everyone wearing masks all the time  Seattle/Chicago Airports: 0 temp checks. Most people wearing masks all the time. Many not wearing them.   #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	My glasses fog up... so I could literally run into someone and kill them! How am I suppose to walk like this?? So by not wearing a mask you could say I am saving lives! Why is life so hard? What have I done to deserve this? Says a whiner. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	My kids are at camp all day in a mask. They don’t complain. It’s possible. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	My parents used to tell me “don’t believe everything you see on the internet”. Now we got random, source-less social media pop ups like this one that are just gonna keep these lockdowns going. Just wear a mask until we flatten the curve like other countries did #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	NO MASK = DEAD PEOPLE + DEAD ECONOMY  #WearAMask #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	New best marketing for my personal training business: "get in shape so you can stop complaining about a mask somehow cutting off all of your usable oxygen" #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Nice mask. I'm going to start wearing a freaking power rangers helmet at some point.   #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Note to #MAGA morons who refuse to wear masks; People who wear masks are not your enemies. The fat guy with orange face who tells you not to is your enemy.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Okay @funder @TheRickWilson @ProjectLincoln We need to name the Mask Nihilist movement. Rachel just reported Gov. Ricketts forced local governments to drop masks or risk losing Fed Covid money. Need to isolate them politically and publicize stupidity . #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Omg! Fauci says we could have 100k NEW CASES EVERY DAY if we don’t turn this around. Oh. My. Lord.   WEAR. A. FUCKING. MASK.   #WearYourMaskFL #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	On my walk this beautiful morning in @48Ward at least 50% of people wearing mask/face covering, staying 6 ft apart. Keep up the good work Uptown, let’s keep coronavirus cases low! #Chicago @carmenwinona @UptownUpdate #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	One of the fun things about knowing how to sew is making masks for family and friends.  #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	One question for pro lifers. Wouldn’t covering your face with a mask to protect pregnant women from COVID be pro life? Because it seems republicans don’t care about anyone’s life but their own when they refuse to wear them. Makes them look a little hypocritical. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Only babies don't wear masks. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Out on FMLA again. Might be good for #streaming time, damn hard on the bank account. Not so great for the patients for whom I won't be able to care, either.  My mask protects you. Your mask protects me. Gma's gettin' mighty tired of your shite, people. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	People in the United States who  refuse to wear a mask to protect their fellow citizens are not patriots, they are selfish bastards. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	People should not be allowed to board without a mask.   They should be restrained in a secluded area and be banned from flying anywhere if they remove their mask during flight.   #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Please do not mix up protesters and rioters. Also last I checked we are talking about Michigan and Grand Rapids. Not the protests in other states. I am sure you were perfectly fine with the people that shouted at police officer without masks in March and April. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Please pray for those who cherish life so much that they fight for the rights of an unborn fetus yet hate wearing a mask to protect others. God do it.  #MaskUp #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Praying for the Mayor of Mobile and the city council as they make it critical decision today #covid19 #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Put a goddamn mask on!It’s not that hard! Doctors, nurses and first responders do it every day! You don’t want to die in a car accident? You put a seatbelt on. You don’t want to crack your head open? You wear a helmet. Do you understand where im going with this???!#WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Put on a mask, asshole. #MaskItOrCasket #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Realistically, we all should have been wearing masks since Feb 1st...today is July 1st and look what’s happened...since wearing a mask is politicized amongst a divided country, where will be on Jan 1st? #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Remember that moment when those of us with the ubiquitous ‘underlying health conditions’ saw everyone close their doors to protect us, and it felt so loving and safe... until they all got bored and went to the beach?   #StillHereStillSick #StayHome #WashYourHands #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Remember when the blue states were the covid19 problem states? They put masks on while Trumpers acted like Trumpers and now the red states are the bad ones.....dont get it twisted though because blue is ramping back up.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Rough, ain’t it, Buttercup? No wonder many people prefer an endotracheal tube - which won’t hide your glowing smile by the way - and having someone else do their breathing for them.   #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Science proves mask are useful during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Maybe wear one for a few mins while in shared public spaces like grocery stores and the like, without bitching about your freedoms being taken away. 507k deaths worldwide in 4 months is not a small number. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Security might want to pull that mask up over his nose. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	See all you non mask wearing people tried so hard to keep from complying with the orders and now Europe won’t even take us. Thanks for making America the outcasts of the world. #EuropeanUnion #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives

20200701	1	Seriously?! Have you noticed that this virus is raging across the country? Hospital workers wear masks for 12 hour shifts. They are doing just fine. Clearly you are NO Superman. Stop whining and Get over yourself! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Singing, talking, coughing, sneezing...they all are no good when it comes to being too close these days, without a mask. #WearAMask #SocialDistance #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Some people with respiratory issues have no choice than to go out AND they still wear masks!  #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Surgeon General, head of CDC, Leadership on both sides of the aisle seem to think masks are a good idea. Please just wear them, everyone. Idc if you put maga on them, although I'd prefer BLM. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Surgeons, etc.  perform hours-long procedures wearing masks and don’t get lighted-headed or pass out. I literally just did a 50-min cycling class wearing one, and didn’t need a fainting couch. You’re full of sh*t and irresponsible. Grow up and #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	THANK YOU!! Fellow RT here & the excuses for not wearing a mask are completely asinine. If we can wear them for 12+ hrs, you can wear it for your Target run, Karen. I can’t see my 87 yr old Gram who has COPD & lung cancer during this. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	TO EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE MASKS :  1. Don't wear one 2. Drive immediately to the nearest COVID ICU and force your way in 3. Get super close to every patient with COVID 4. Let me know how the "no mask" thing worked out for you in a few weeks. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Targeted testing doesn’t make these migrant workers’ +s suddenly present—they were already + & wouldn’t have been counted IF NOT for proactive testing. How many other + clusters exist without being tested? Be cautious, distance yourself & #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200701	1	The larger protest took place over a month ago so no. Also protesters are wearing mask and social distancing. But I am sure Fod News doesn't tell you that. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	The more people would just respect wearing a mask the quicker this all could be done with.  #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	The people complaining about no Knoxville Nationals or no Kings Royal are the same people who wont do what needs to be done to have those races. Shame is it was all avoidable if you would all just wear a mask. #TruthHurts #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	The problem is you don't live in a bubble, so your bad choices affect me, undermining my good choices. You spewing your germs everywhere compromises MY life, and life of those I love, and those YOU love. During WWII everyone sacrificed, rationed. Grow up. #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	The racist tweets are 100% intentional. #BlackLivesMatter #StrongerWithBiden #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200701	1	To anyone wondering bout the toll this virus has taken from lives, here is a dose of reality. I have lost 7 good friends, one i considered a sister. So when you think by not wearing a mask that you only affects yourself. Tell that to their families. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	To every #antimaskers who is complaining about the economy shutting down and suffering, you do realize that it’s all your fault? The most effective way to stop the spread of #COVIDー19 is to #WearAMask if you genuinely care about people you’ll suck it up and #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	To the #SouthernElectricCompany working on N. Donahue: only ONE OF the 12 employees working on power lines is wearing a mask. When they congregate around the be of a truck (the proverbial water cooler), they aren't #SocialDistancing.  #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	To the 20something that clearly spent over an hour putting her face on to go to the bank: Hi! I'm not judging you as a person on your physical appearance. You are a symmetrical and pleasant looking human being. However...no mask? Bitch you ugly. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Today is a bad asthma day, nothing to do with covid I’m still safe from that just a day in the life with Asthma some times it flares ... so if I see you on the rare occasion I’m out today and you aren’t wearing a mask sorry but we’ll catch up on WhatsApp. #WearADamnMask

20200701	1	Was shopping today at Lowe's and Home Depot in N Conway NH. Most people at Lowe's, customers & employees wore masks but at home Depot, about half didn't. This is the state whose motto is "Live free or die". I guess they're serious about the dying part. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Watching the governors campaign hubs and saw 2 masks between Huntsman, Wright, Huges. #maskuputah #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	We came down from NorCal for the week. We were shocked that 90% of people walk or bike around without masks they can pull up when they get close to someone. Most people in my town run with masks at all times and move in the middle of the street, but not in OC. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	We need Statewide mask mandate to stop the spread! #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	We're awesome.  In Rochester, NY where I live, EVERYONE has a mask.  Honestly, a lot of people are still staying home too.  This is why we have those numbers.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	We're living a real life zombie movie, but we can't ID them and they don't have to bite us to kill us. Act accordingly. And #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Wear a mask. It shows respect for your fellow human beings. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Wear a mask...The life you save maybe your own. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. You. Fucking. Fuck.   ........I may be a tad emotional about the 130,000+ American deaths. Why aren't you?   #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Wearing a mask shows that you are a kind, caring, and compassionate person.   It’s not political - it’s practical. And it’s the right thing to do.   #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Wearing a mask to protect others shows strength, not weakness. #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Welcome back! The only time you will see me without a mask in public is virtually. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Well, well, well; wouldn’t you know that Jared is involved w/ @realDonaldTrump on this?! No wonder we still don’t have enough testing. Honesty is the best policy but this admin has no idea how to tell the truth.  HELP US @maddow @kaitlancollins @Yamiche #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Went for a drive up to Deception Pass in my home state of WA - parking lot & scenic observation points all full.  NO social distancing, NO masks!  Stayed in my car & kept going.  #WashingtonState #BeResponsible #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	What's more likely, Kiba becoming Hokage or you dying from wearing a mask?  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Who knew adulting was as simple as wearing a mask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	Why - WHY??!! - would Nebraska GOP Governor Ricketts threaten to withhold federal funding from counties that require wearing masks DURING A PANDEMIC?!  #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Why aren't you seeing that so many are suffering, have suffered, and died.   Is that not enough cause for concern?   What else will you need to be convinced that it is worth wearing #masks for and practicing social distancing? #COVIDー19 #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Why can’t we think about masks as a cool new fashion accessory?   Yes, they are uncomfortable and annoying but so are purses and we all have those.   #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	With anger directed at the lame-street media, alt-left, and never-Trumpsters, why hasn’t that collection of citizenry been blamed for the anti-mask movement? Who benefits from people not wearing a mask? Maybe the Rushians are being paid by the Russians. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Witnessed my first mask dispute while out for my first time waiting to pick up food to go. Going back into my house for the next three months and not coming out. Be nice to food workers and #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Wore a mask while grocery shopping. And survived. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Wow you should see a physician for your weak condition. My 82 and 90 yr old parents rock their masks all the time with no trouble. You must have underlying comorbidities. Get help fast. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	YO IDIOTS WEAR A FUCKING MASK. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Yeah, that didn't happen, snowflake.  If someone with severe Asthma can wear a mask with no issues whatsoever then your pathetic ass can too.  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Yes, keep the assholes out of the state, the quarantine should be mandatory and enforced #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Yes, you are wasting your time. Masks work. And let's say that there's only a 0.1% chance you can save a life by being mildly inconvenienced. Wouldn't you want to? If they're good enough for health professionals, they're good enough for me. #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	Yesterday & will wear one today & every time I leave my house. This only works if we all participate. My mask keeps my droplets from infecting someone else in case I have the virus & don’t know it yet. Others’ masks do likewise for me. If they’ll wear one. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Yesterday at the home repair store. Needed to fix my plumbing. Most people were wearing masks. Only saw one couple without. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	You AREN’T slowing the spread! You’re on the side of the virus. Mandate mask wearing, don’t forbid it. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You also said we need to be more optimistic. Tou know what would make me more optimistic about this pandemic? If everyone wore a mask! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You are deliberately killing the people of this state with your homicidal decision to prevent mask wearing. What’s wrong with you? #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	You are to blame for all the deaths and no one else. Your inaction, calling it a hoax, stealing supplies from hospitals for your own gain, delay in testing, etc. is all on you. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You can't demand schools reopen in the fall but also refuse to take infection control measures yourself.  Prevent the spread! #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You know how some places have a “no shirt, no shoes, no service” policy?  In other news, people are still saying wearing a mask goes against their constitutional rights and being loud as hell about it. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You know what would help? A mask mandate! #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	You make me laugh until I cry....I laugh because you are witty and cry because it’s true. How can the leader of our great nation be proud of not wearing a mask during this horrific pandemic?  Extreme narcissism and love of himself only are the only answers. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You realize that the medical community has been wearing masks for hours on end now and before the pandemic (think hours long surgeries). I wear my mask all day in the hospital and I wear it when I leave my house. I’m fine and so are you #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You said it was a liberal “hoax” being spread through the fake news media - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE - and liberal Democrats just to make Donny look bad. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You should probably head to the hospital. That doesn't sound healthy at all. Sometimes I wear a mask when bike riding and I'm never struggling to breathe, so there is most likely something wrong with you. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You shouldn’t be blaming china. You should be blaming yourself and your administration for politizing wearing a mask. Left or right #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200701	1	You would think this would appeal to Trump, since he believes his re-election is economy driven!  But, Trump’s too vain to put a mask on! #Biden2020Landslide #AmericaStrongerWithBiden #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200701	1	You're embarrassing yourself again. Is China responsible for the inept attempts by your administration to combat Coronavirus? Sure I assume they, like Putin, have input into any decision you make, but still. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Young people who've resumed "normal" social life, mask-less because your age group has much lower mortality, talk to a young COVID survivor  Which is worse: Death? Or life with permanent damages to your lungs, heart, kidneys, blood circulation, all of the above?  #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Your simplistic view just spreads more ignorance. If you don't know how social distancing AND masks help slow the spread then ask a professional before looking like a complete the idiot. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You’re a whiny little baby. I’m sure there’s a lot of people with respiratory diseases that would love to hear about your difficulty breathing in a mask ... suck it up doofus, #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You’re also struggling to think or reason. And it has nothing to Dom with wearing a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	You’re an idiot. People are now out of work once again w/zero unemployment left. They used it the first go round. Here we are again in Florida(especially SFL)w/ beaches & bars closed.  You will tank our economy if you don’t make mask wearing mandatory. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	Y’all, even Mitch McConnell told people to wear a mask. This is getting ridiculous. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	agreed. This mask arguement is the most assnine argument ever. I say DAILY... it's NOT that hard. I have asthma. As a runner, I would wear a mask in spring during pollen season for years. Pollen doesn't even kill. Covid19 does. #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	grown adults r literally throwing temper tantrums in public over wearing a mask... #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	the CDC has said it before and will say it again: wearing a mask, washing your hands, and social distancing will help protect yourself and others. #COVIDー19 #SkimmLife #WearADamnMask
20200701	1	trump supporters are like lemmings trying to migrate.   These migrating lemmings need to stop trying to take the rest of us non lemmings with them.   We aren’t down to migrate.   #LemmingMigration #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	0	@HEB If my legislator does not mandate masks (no LAW requiring them) I don't need a grocery store to do so. You're a retail store not an elected legislator.  I will be taking my business to @kroger , I will not be forced to wear a mask, burqua or star of David. #NoMask
20200702	0	@ksbw Are you doing your research on  wearing masks all day? Or are you simply listening to what you're told by  Fauci? I think you should be looking into this as professional news reporters. There's info. out there on how unhealthy it is.  There's peer reviews too! #NoMasks

20200702	0	To me the masks look like people are walking around afraid. Afraid to die. Afraid to be shamed. Afraid they will be blamed if they get others sick. We live in a shame, blame, and hateful culture. Do you always want to live afraid of what others think? #complydontconform #nomasks

20200702	1	#masksdontwork says if it's not 100% effective then it's useless.  Fortunately for your brains, you're wrong.  Masks keep your virus-infected spit drops from landing on shit. Add in social distancing and you've already done more than Trump.   #coronavirus #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	(2/2) the frontline heroes who wear PPE kits for longer hours in this heatwave. Wear masks, follow hygiene, wash your hands and stay home as far as possible. Let’s express our gratitude by following the rules and not adding to their burden. #NationalDoctorsDay #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200702	1	A woman holding her mask in her hand was crowding me in a store (with state mask requirements in effect). I said “those work better on your face”. She sped past me and shouted “it is NOT, it’s a CHOICE”.  I actually laughed out loud. I wonder if she’s sick yet.  #MasksSaveLives

20200702	1	Appreciate some celebs who have tested positive for COVID19 are not hesitating to declare it and also building confidence in people with their inspiring video messages.   Way to go! This is the need of the hour. Don’t panic.. #StayHomeStaySafe #WearADamnMask

20200702	1	At this point we don’t even know if herd immunity will do the trick. We won’t know for a long time, after much testing. And the testing that has been done so far doesn’t look promising. #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask

20200702	1	Can’t wait for another round of listening to arrogant politicians tell certain peasants that their livelihoods aren’t essential.   #COVIDー19 #lockdownextension #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Christmas in July should be a thing this year because so many people won’t live to see December.  Wear the mask, you selfish prick.#COVIDー19 #TrumpKillsUS #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Cocktails to go are popular in Wisconsin now. We are creating new traditions. Americans are creative people. #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Come on Halton get on board. Canceling car parades for birthdays but no face masks bi law. It's not hard. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Come on guys, be the leaders that the people of Florida NEED right now, step up and mandate masks!  Enough with the Trump lackey bullshit, and prioritize people’s health over politics!   #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Compliments in 2020.... them "nice mask", me "thanks" #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Could everyone please retweet this until we get an intelligent answer? Doctors out there-what medical conditions could legitimately prevent someone from wearing a mask AND not put them at risk when they went out in public without one? #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	DJT just gave up! He wasnt smarter than the national experts, and it pissed him off. So he let the strategy go to shit. He'll blame them of course. #AmericansAreDying #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Dayton ranks lowest in the state for education, so honestly I’m not surprised at the number of people complaining about the mask mandate #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Doing our makeup to go out got a lot easier.. just liner/lashes and brows then throw on your mask and you’re good to go!  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Don't like profanity but sometimes it's necessary: Wear your f*cking masks! Wash your f*cking hands! Follow f*cking science! #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Don’t come into my workplace and first thing out of your mouth is an apology for not wearing a mask. You obviously don’t care or you’d have worn one in your short walk in and out of where I work. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Dr. Fauci is a world renowned expert on infectious diseases. Dan Patrick was a radio host and failed sports bar owner. Fairly certain it’s obvious who Texas officials and all Texans should listen to. And it’s not @DanPatrick. #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Even Mitch "Moscow" McConnell thinks you should be wearing a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Ever notice how the articles that say masks aren't effective against coronavirus are on websites you've never heard of before? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Fool...wear a mask and Dr. Birx is lust another Trump lackey. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Forget the vaccine for Covid. We need one for stupidity and that will take care of the rest.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Full disclosure: Anyone who doesn't follow the science is a f*cking idiot. #Science #ScienceMatters #COVIDIOTS #COVIDー19 #pandemic #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Get caught doing blackface? Wear a Mask. #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	God damn virus. I’m sick, sick, sick of this shit. Sweaty face from wearin a mask, wiping shit down i buy from the store, me bitchin about other ppl not wearin masks, masks some how being political, forgetting my mask, masks.......I think I just hate fucking masks. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Good job. We had a plan. Open in phases. If the numbers went up, as they have we’d dial back. That too has happened. Good on you @LIVEattheBike look forward to seeing you all. #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Gov. Newsom, speaking as forcefully as I’ve seen him on the maddening mask issue: “Wearing a face covering is a sign of toughness. It’s a sign of resolve. It’s a sign of someone who gives a damn.” #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Governor Wolf just signed a new Order demanding masks worn by all the moment leaving the house.  Hopefully this will put some teeth behind businesses asking customers to wear masks.  How fucking hard is it? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Great analogy! Nobody is questioning the duty to wear clothes. But when people are being asked to wear a mask to save others, it’s a big scandal and a restriction of their freedom. I call BS! #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Guess everyone enjoys homeschooling more than masks. There’s no way schools can open. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	HAPPY  DAY TO MY FAVOURITE COUNTRY. #HappyCanadaDay CELEBRATE IT BY STAYING THE FUCK AWAY FROM PEOPLE. SERIOUSLY. CORONAVIRUS AIN'T TAKING THE DAY OFF TO CELEBRATE THE TRUE NORTH STRONG AND FREE. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Hanks was diagnosed with coronavirus early on. Rita Wilson had it too. They are lucky to have survived it. Not wanting to wear a mask doesn't make you a freedom fighter, it makes you a selfish little bitch who ignores science and public safety for convenience. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	He's probably in the bunker since all of the testing kits are taking up most of the room in the West Wing, ya know, for the non-existent pandemic?  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Heard this yesterday... Open bars/restaurants and no masks today mean closed schools in the fall.   Let that sink in.   Wear a damn mask, physical distance, stay home. We aren’t back to normal.  #COVID19 #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Heavily @ ing people I know IRL on FB for being dumbasses about not wearing masks. #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Her husband went by me. The two spoke about me. This was too much. I removed my mask, re-entered the aisle and coughed loudly near her, not at her. The husband exploded. Without masks, we argued inches apart, leading to his making threats. It was all very foolish. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Here’s a new theory. Anyone who will vote for Trump should not wear a mask... Anyone who will vote for Biden should wear two! It will just “go away” faster, as tRump put it...  #COVID__19 #coronavirus #NotMyPresident #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Here’s a thought: if you can’t breathe when you wear a mask, just stay home. If you need groceries— send someone who isn’t a little bitch. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Here’s the thing about all you fucks that are butt hurt about wearing a mask. If you’re right, then the only inconvenience is wearing a mask. But if you’re wrong, you risk killing thousands of people, if not more. Stop being a douche. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Hey "leader" - why aren't you leading by example and encouraging/wearing a mask?  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Hey @DollarGeneral and @Maverik Why do your employees think they don’t have to wear a mask, in a state madating masks for ALL employees??? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Hey MAGAts, So you're perfectly fine with your Drs or Nurses not bothering with the inconvenience of a mask?  Guess you won't have a problem with second hand smoke then. Or womens reproductive rights. Your body, your choice. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Hey St. Louis! Masks are now required everywhere publicly!!! #wearyourmaskSTL #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Hey Twitter.. @jlucci92 says “MASKS DON’T WORK” and wants to talk to some doctors so he can convince them he is correct. Let’s RT and tag some Doctors so he can see how thet feel. #Covid #COVIDー19 #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Hey, asshole. If you’re not wearing the mask for me because I’m immunocompromised, wear it for YOU because we’ll be back in lockdown and you won’t be able to go to Cracker Barrel, OK?!  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	He’s gambling with everyone’s lives. The morons who think their civil liberties are being abused are abusing everyone else by not wearing masks. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Honestly after awhile my mask has become hella comfortable and I almost prefer wearing it over not wearing. It’s like a nice face blanket  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	How about an executive order for masks? #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	How about mask protests oh yea have to have one #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	How are you Pro-Life but don’t want to wear a mask? Make that make sense to me. #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	How f'n hard can it be for the Giant Peach in charge to grow some BALLS, close the entire US and quarantine EVERYBODY for 14 f'n days? Hell, we've already done it for 4 mos. We can do 2 wks standing on our heads. #SickOfTheWhiners #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	How have @IronMaiden not got in on the branded face mask market yet? Who wouldn't want a mask with Eddie's grin on it? #HeavyMetal #metal #IronMaiden #facemasks #coronavirus #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	How many "likes" can I give this!  If everyone would just mask it up, we'd get through this so much faster.  And healthier.  #GoBucks #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	How to get others to wear a mask.  When they ask “why are you wearing a mask”  Tell them, “I have COVID but don’t want to stay home ”  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Humans, please put on your damn masks if you're in public to cover your nose and mouth. Most of y'all are covering your chins and foreheads:- that's not the point #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	I am getting so used to these facemasks now when i dont wear them my face feels naked ... def see a tan coming on due to the mask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I am so angry about this picture.  They say wash your hands social distance and wear a mask. . . So where is your damn mask????  I want you to come down to camp COVID ICU and then you can wipe those grins off your faces.  This is not a photo op.  People are DYING!! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I can't quit Facebook, but I can definitely mute all the conspiracy theorists one by one! #sotired #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I can’t believe tribes in the rainforest are getting better preparation for COVID than the United States is. #coronavirus #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I can’t even tell you how angry I am seeing people post that they still aren’t going to wear a mask after the executive order. How selfish do you have to be to know it can save someone’s life and still not give a crap? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I don't understand the problem with wearing one. You wear seatbelts for protection,  put children in car seats for protection,  have guns for protection,  but can't wear a mask for protection of others.   #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I don’t get why @GovTimWalz is wavering on masks just do it - makes it easy if we all have to do it #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I guess my point is wear a mask when you go out BUT ALSO CONTINUE SOCIAL DISTANCING. CONTINUE WASHING YOUR HANDS. DON’T GO OUT IF YOU DON’T HAVE TO. STAY HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. DON’T BE SELFISH!!! #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I hate hearing “I can’t breathe” from people complaining about wearing a mask. #BLACK_LIVES_MATTER #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I have a heart rate/O2 meter to keep an eye on my heart rate because I have tachycardia, a symptom of having graves disease. When I wear a well fitted multi layer mask my O2  never goes below 98%. That is all. Go back to whatever you were doing. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I have bad teeth. I can’t even say they’re crooked becuase they’re just. A mess. Not only am I wearing a mask to be a decent human being, but I am covering my horrible smile and that makes me smile even more.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I have noticed today that A LOT of accounts on here pushing the "I won't wear a mask" crap appear to be fake/bots, probably russians hoping to continue dividing us and actively ensuring American citizens die  why is trump's cult so in love with russia?  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I just bought 7 masks in two days & I already have enough to wear a different one every day for a month. (It helps if they’re cute and comfortable). @joahlove #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I just canceled two diagnostic procedures bc what they're looking for is less likely to kill me than COVID. People w/ disabilities are foregoing treatment for things causing them pain bc y'all can't wear a mask and wash your hands. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I just got a fuck ton a masks to match all my clothes. Masks can be stylish. SO WEAR THEM, PROTECT YOURSELF AND OTHERS! #CoronavirusPandemic #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	I just returned from an hour massage where most of it was face down in the head support with a mask and had no problem.  My therapist had not problem too.  #MasksSaveLives #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I knew this wouldn’t work out. But ppl aren’t helping themselves get through this faster by NOT wearing the MASK either !! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I know Halloween is coming, but this isn't the kind of mask I was hoping to wear...DO your part and save Halloween!  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I live in LA and if you only saw how many beach picnics and large gatherings with no mask  living their best lives. #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	I live in MA, where everyone still wears a mask, and no one complains.  We are the only part of the country that is beating this thing. In 3+ months of this, I have yet to see anyone pass out from wearing a mask.  The rest of the country is a bunch of wimps.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I live in NH & we've had 3 days with no new cases & my county has had 0 deaths in 3 weeks with only 4 new cases in that time period. At the grocery store yesterday 98% of the ppl were wearing masks. A few younger ppl went without but that was it. Hot & muggy too.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I might “travel” to Tuscaloosa on Saturday to watch fireworks with a mask on at a friends house on my own blanket. Does that count? #SaferAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I ran into target today and as I was half way in, the horrible realization of forgetting my mask in the car hit me. I was in and out on a return but the stares for the other customers made me want to curl into a ball  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I really like your phrase, wear a mask save a life. Did you ever tweet it out? Found this: #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	I reckon the only reason Trump did a 180 on masks is cuz he finally found smear free tan cream.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I remember for the majority of my life i was not allowed to get married and was considered a second class citizen. But please go on about your masks and how they are infringing upon your freedom... #COVIDー19 #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I see more people not wearing masks than are. And even when they have them on, they’re not covering their face properly. This is most obvious in grocery and other retail. People aren’t listening! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I see tweets from politicians telling people to wear masks--with incentives. It matters, you're tough, it's not about your freedom. I DON'T GET IT--WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR SOMEONE TO WEAR A MASK. THIS SHOULD BE A NON ISSUE. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I think @chrissyteigen missed a real opportunity during quarantine by not doing a Robe of the Day song like she did with the headbands.   We’re still in it though so here’s hoping #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I think the first question they should ask is, “Did you wear a mask?” If the answer is no they go to the bottom of the list. Selfish fu*kers! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I used to think ppl were truly stupid before this pandemic even started. The pandemic has now proven that they are given how hardly anyone I’ve seen out is wearing a mask. Too bad covid doesn’t only impact those who lack the intelligence to care #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I was out yesterday reporting on a story, and had a mask on me at all times, but admit, I would forget to put it back on sometimes. I was outdoors all day, and SD but still. My mask game leaves a lot to be desired. It’s not easy, but entirely necessary. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I will be so surprised when he and other police districts start enforcing ANY rules! So far, haven't seen them do anything in regards to COVID-19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I will never get used to the idea that no one can read my lips when I’m wearing a mask. #FactoryLife #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I will stand before the wind and make it respect me." I honored his choice and went inside. The next day, the storm came, and the man was killed. The wind does not respect a fool. Do not stand before the wind, Gowron. 2/2  TL;DR Wear a damn mask. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I wonder how many people he got sick as well...and how many people they will in turn spread the virus to, and so on and so on until Americans learn the hard way. #stayhome #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I'm a big sports fan. Always have been. But there's no freaking way that the @NBA ,@NHL , @MLB or @NFL are going to play this year. Look at the infection rates, they're skyrocketing WITHOUT playing. Time to hunker down and wait for a vaccine. Oh and....#WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I've had about enough of these stupid people refusing to wear a mask.  We will never go back to any semblance of normalcy if everyone doesn't get on board.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	IDC that you don’t want to wear a mask, I mean I do care, but I don’t.  I care that bc of this desire to not wear a mask, you (plural) abuse this very much needed law.... for a mask.  A mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If #masks work, why did I just get a horrific whiff of last night's corndog & tator-tot dinner when a fat lady 2 carts away from me just crop-dusted a fart down the entire frozen foods aisle? #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	If @realDonaldTrump had been the one to demand mask wearing the right would have jumped in head first and the left would be screaming no. I don’t understand why this is political. wear a mask, save lives, move forward. #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	If Vega,Scorpion and Voldo can do it,so can you. #wearamask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If the worst thing that’s happened to you this week is that someone has asked you to wear a mask, it’s probably time to get off your entitled horse and be grateful. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If they can wear it, we have no right to give any excuses!!! #IndiaFightsCoronavirus #COVID19 @thekiranbedi #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	If you actually want to help Trump win then wear your damn mask! If this virus is still killing thousands by election day, he's gonna lose big time. #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	If you believe wearing a mask is an infringement on your freedom as an American, why aren't you complaining about seat belts too? #coronavirus #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	If you can require people to wear seat belts, you can require people to wear masks. It's simple. Why do so many want to kill other Americans, coloring it as their "freedom?" #MandateMasks #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If you can wear a Halloween mask, that if made from latex could kill someone. Then you can wear a medical mask something that can keep you safe from a pandemic that has killed millions and are helping people not get this virus and get terminal death please #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If you think this is @ you, it is. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If you think wearing a mask is infringing on your constitutional rights, are you gonna boycott pants next??#WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If you truly believe that "ALL LIVES MATTER," then wear a mask if you must go out in public. #COVID #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	If you want football this fall wear a mask so we can enjoy saying #GoPackGo each Sunday #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	If your mask isn't covering your mouth and nose you're a fucking moron. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Im getting real tired of wiping down my groceries with bleach but u gotta do what u gotta do  #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Imagine the press asking Obama about the surge in Corona virus & his answer was “it’s going to disappear, I hope”. Or Bush, or any actual potus. The stuff trump gets away with is just astonishing. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	In one week Georgia cases have risen from 69,381 to 84,237, an increase of 14,856 cases. . There is not enough data to determine if there will be long term consequences for people who contract the virus and survive.  Please, wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Instead getting tested for Covid, why not just assume you have it, and either stay home or wear a mask.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Interesting how those in the medical field wear masks on a DAILY BASIS and have never COMPLAINED! ALL THOSE ENTITLED #Karens and #Kevins NEED TO STFU AND #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Interesting. 100 years of evidence of mask usage shows no damage and only help. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Is a mask uncomfortable? Yes  Is is hard to breathe sometimes? Yes  Is it worth getting a life threatening disease and possibly spreading it to others? No Karen it’s not  #WearAMask #Karen #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Is asking them to wear masks while they protest against wearing masks too much to (m) ask? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Is there a waiver to refuse medical treatment for those choosing to not wear a mask? #followyourbliss #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	It also ignores the fact that one of the main reasons drastic measures are needed is that people aren't taking precautions on their own like sheltering in place unless going out for essentials, wearing a mask and social distancing. Fucking morons. #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	It blows my mind that people would walk through an airport with no mask. Sure it’s not the ideal situation, but really IN AN AIRPORT?!?!?! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	It is time to stop playing Wack-a-mole with Covid. Unless national standards are established, it will continue to pop up repeatedly. The states touch each other. They aren't divided by moats. Masks need to be worn inside stores & outside when unable 2 distance #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	It reduces the chances. That's how probability works. #coronavirus #StayAtHome #WearAMaskPlease
20200702	1	It seems that only people out here who don’t want to wear masks are white, it’s almost like the feel “intitled” or have some kind of “privilege” #coronavirus #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Its because most protestors have been wearing masks regularly. Plain and simple, masks do work.  #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	It’s not hard people. The mask you wear shows you care. #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	It’s not hard wearing a mask. I always think I’m robbing the store. And the best part. I don’t gotta wear make up. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	It’s not “Either/Or” in this case, in my opinion.  Trump should wear a Mask & tell his supporters to wear one also.  Trump should also resign over #RussianBountyGate #TrumpResignNow #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	I’m sure decent parents don’t want their kids to drive drunk, or text while driving... yet a simple fucking mask is ruining their day.   Want your day ruined? Try being intubated for a ventilator.   #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I’ve been wearing the mask of pretending to be happy for years, y’all can do it #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	I’ve heard/read that if you wear a mask, you’re against Trump.  I’m against Trump because he’s an immature, racist bully and, a mysogynist woman hater with untreated mental health issues who is unfit to run the country.  I wear a mask because IT SAVES LIVES!!  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Just been in my local Aldi, first time I’ve been in a supermarket for about 8 weeks. Quite busy, only myself and another person wearing a mask, no social distancing, no staff directing customers, just a free for all. Almost as if there had been no Covid #Covid19UK #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Just left #gardenofthegods in #colorado safe to say that 98% of people on the trail were NOT wearing masks. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Just want to point out Trump thought wearing a mask would make him look weak. This about-face on masks is just to try and save him in the polls. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	LOVE THIS TWEET.   UNABASHED TRUTH.  HEY ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ENDANGER OTHERS LIVES BY NOT WEARING A MASK...  THIS IS FOR YOU  #NoMasks #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Let's take all the wonderful people who don't want to wear masks and drop them off on a nicely supplied island for about a year.. the rest of us would only have to wear them for 4 weeks or so.  Problem solved.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Like a heard of cattle being lead to a slaughter of their own making! Wear a damn mask! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Like the amount of comments about folks saying “fuck the mask” open up the beaches is absolutely mind boggling!! This virus is not a fuckin joke. It’s not going away. You’re the problem!! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Listen motherfuckers. My mental health as well as many others was the worst it's ever been in our entire lives during quarantine, it was unbearable. So y'all better wear a goddamn mask bc if I have to do that shit again I'm going to be PISSED. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Love that I work with superheros everyday.   #Masks4All #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	MAGA FUCKING MORONS. Don’t you bunch of idiots see what’s happening to the Coronavirus Curve, it’s pretty vertical. Over 50,000 new today.  Lots of states too many people dying! Please don’t contribute to this #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	MD, public health expert and Covid-19 supply specialist #HeWentToJared #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Mandatory mask day! I feel very under inconvenienced. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Masks are important. If you don’t think so. Please talk to the ones with weakened immunities and their hell. Stop being selfish and wear a mask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Masks are useless. Even the N95 masks can't stop particulate 0.1 microns in size.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	May have nothing to do with the mask... #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Mini Prayer: Dear God, please bless all those suffering from #coronavirus and the first responders risking their health to save lives. #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	More bad than now for America? I live in Switzerland from next Monday everyone have to wear mask in the public transportation. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Most people are wearing masks to protect others' lives. Thank you for helping and leading! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	My dog just sneezed on me and my first reaction was “where is his f’ing mask?!” #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	My sisters' 59 yr old father told me today that he doesn't wear a mask when he goes out, and when I pressed him on why not, he said that he'd rather not start a fight by getting into politics with me.  Wearing a mask is not a political issue. It's a health issue. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	My wife has Celiac, she wears a mask every time we go out and I wear a mask for her #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	News flash. We are all vulnerable groupssusceptible to coronavirus. Don’t let your guard down #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	No honey, masks are to protect others from HER. So she clearly doesn't care about others. Unless it's an N95 then a greater chance she's protected too. #science #logic #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	No wearing masks the way the #LoneRanger did? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	No!  I literally can't believe masks are an issue during a Pandemic... #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	No, it's based not on religion or race, but the fact @GOP's @POTUS & @VP @realDonaldTrump's totally screwed up! #COVID19 #CoronaVirus aka to Trump #Corona19(???) #StayHomeSaveLifes #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Noses people!! Damn it! Nothing makes me shake my head as much as seeing someone wearing a mask with their nose hanging out! What the hell are you doing??  Do you pull your underwear all the way up?? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Not buyin what this man is sellin. I’ll keep wearing my mask, thanks. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Not sure what God you believe in. Everything I know about the Bible and Jesus points me toward wearing the mask. I think your god is America. #falsegod #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Of course, he does...the lone ranger wore his mask over his eyes as well. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Oh hello Dr Lady. You really MUST contact #DrFauci with your proclamation on #masks So many #scientists and they’ve all been wrong. Thank goodness we have brainiacs like you to guide us #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Ohhh poor baby!! I bet about 130,000 Americans would wear a mask without whining-if the could-but they can’t!! Maybe if you closed your mouth it would be easier or We could call you a whaaaambulance !!!#GOPGenocide #GOPBetrayedAmerica #MaskUp #mask #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Ok Karen, if you do have a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a mask, then WHY ARE YOU EVEN OUTSIDE AS IF IT WAS NOTHING?! YOU’RE LITERALLY HIGH RISK! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Ok, so the same people who have been groped by TSA agents, after they saw who knows what in a millimeter xray machine, have decided that wearing a mask is an egregious violation of their rights?  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	On Trump's ideal face mask:  "Delusional self-praise" "Vaguely racist BS" "Lies"  He'll need multiple masks in prison.  Please add your ideas and RT @CelestialSandra's tweet.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Once again, if not wearing a mask cost only you your last breath I would truly be fine with that.  Good riddance to you.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Only in the south.... my mother went to the Dr. today in Alabama and he made rude remarks about her wearing a mask!!   Dr: You can breath wearing that thing!?   Yet he didn’t have on a mask!! Wtf is wrong with these people! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Or the life boat...meanwhile he is sneaking on one like the coward he is. #coronavirus #TrumpTraitor #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Or....... have delayed gratification & wait until next 4th of July 2021 to do your celebrating because causeing this to be yours or someone else’s last 4th is incredibly irresponsible! #StayAtHome #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Our first civil war started over the expansion or not of slavery into the new territories. Our second civil war started because a bunch of babies couldn’t wear a mask to protect others. So sad.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	PLEASE WEAR MASKS, follow norms of social distancing and keep washing your hands often with a soap for atleast 20 seconds. #COVID19India #sanitiseyourhands #SocialDistancing #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	People continue to insist on congregating in groups, going to bars, and refuse to wear masks.  Remember: hospitals are overwhelmed, some are out of beds.  Healthcare workers still don't have adequate PPE, are using the same mask for a week.   #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People fr the Navajo Nation were ridiculed, vocally (some physically) attacked for wearing masks. Told unclean, go back to your Rez. The Rez, if this downturn holds, is ahead of AZ Governor. For the next 3 weekends we're on lockdown from 8pm Friday to 5 am Monday. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People in the timeline upset over Gov Wolf mandating masks in public in PA... have you not been wearing them prior to this mandate????????? Am I missing something here?????? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People like you who won’t wear a mask are spreading COVID. People wear masks to protect you. It’s the least you can do. Selfish. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People mad about mask laws:  "What do you mean I can't just drive my truck through the middle of this public park!? My freedom to drive a truck on grass is WAY more important than your freedom to not get run over by a truck!"  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People should listen to Hottovy’s story. His experience is something to be aware of.  Get reliable info to make everyone more careful, both for themselves and their families and neighbors.   Even young people can be “crushed.”  Disinfect.  #StayHomeSaveLives #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People want to be rebels & refuse masks & social distancing. These are the consequences. Of course, if trump was any kind of leader this would have been over. Like every other country... #TrumpIsAFailure #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People who are wearing masks are saving more lives than the ones who are not. #WearADamnMask #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	People worried about “killing their immune system” due to wearing a mask in a store while shopping, please lick the pavement and the palms of your hands after taking it off. That’ll give you all the bacteria you need to show that immune system who’s who! #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	People's galaxy brains when covid safety measures ease up: COVID CANT HURT ME NO MORE.  The law was made for people. Not for viruses. YALL. Even if it is not required by law please consider the situation and try to limit what you can. #coronavirus #StayAtHome #WearAMaskPlease
20200702	1	Perhaps, if Americans studied history by reading books rather than looking at statues Marco would know by now that in 1918 masks helped. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Petition to make everyone who wears the mask underneath the nose wear a clown nose.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Please wear a mask. Simple as that. COVID-19 is no joke. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Poor Karen. The same rights that she has to not wear a mask extend to the company that has the right to refuse her service. I don’t see anybody going up in arms about no shirt, no shoes, no service. #wtf #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Posted today in my apartment Commons:   "Masks are the new bra:  * They are uncomfortable!  * You only wear one to go out!  * When you DON'T wear one everybody notices!"  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMaskPlease
20200702	1	Pray for a vaccine. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Protest in New York and on the east coast also and guess what no rise in cases. Cant blame the protestors It’s because people became complacent and didn’t wear mask and social distance. It’s not that hard to do and lives will be saved. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Put a friggen mask on if you want the economy to open!  #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Put on a fcuking mask douchewagons. #COVIDー19 #WeNeedAPOTUSWho #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	RESPECT SCIENCE RESPECT NATURE RESPECT EACH OTHER #coronavirus #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Really?  And you still refuse to wear a mask!  Your are a dolt. #VoteTrumpOut #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Refusing to wear a mask is like driving drunk. Pass it on. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Remember that COVID cases spike from a couple weeks ago? That was from MDW. #StayHomeStaySafe or at least  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Rode my bike with a mask on for 10 miles, wiped out, drove to the ER with my mask on, and my O2 saturation was still 98% #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Same. Born and raised here. A Lot of these people are transplants. A Lot Unfortunately are also, natives. Either way they're Selfish And... #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Shame on @HEB. You're just pandering to people with your little "masks are mandatory" signs because when it comes down to it you're too cowardly to enforce it. We are in a crisis.  #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Shopping pre-2020: yes, these jeans I bought online fit perfectly!  Shopping in 2020: yes, these masks I bought online fit perfectly! They're snug and comfy!  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	So I heard someone say today why are you wearing a mask? You don’t have to do that until Friday. Like the virus doesn’t start until Friday? Gawd. No wonder 130,000 people have died. #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #DumbAsDirt #WearADamnMask #mask #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	So I limit the amount of times I have to wear it. Shop only when needed and do it quickly. I also found a mask that lets me breathe a little easier (or at least I think it does)  I go through all of this not for my sake, but for yours.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	So glad. But it's not being enforced. Luckily people in my area take it seriously. Only one couple at the home repair store weren't wearing a mask. I gave them a dirty look. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	So much for the Irish government ordering wearing of masks to be mandatory. So many people not wearing them on @Luas trams. Staff passing by and doing noting. Why are these people not thrown off the trams? #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	So now flying without wearing a mask is equivalent to a penalty card in soccer?  WTF!  No mask, no fly!  If they are repeat offenders, they are banned for life from that airline.   Enough with the participation trophy generation shit!  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	So sad and it could have been prevented.  Wear a mask save lives. #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	So these States that laughed at NYS are now requiring everyone to wear masks. Guess @NYGovCuomo got this one right!!!! Better late than never #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	So... 30 days before workouts you want to make this announcement!! It's too late. You had a chance to flatten the curve. When you opened the state, you should've made it mandatory to wear a mask. It's too late, bootlicker!#WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Some of y’all be wearing a mask your entire life but are scared to put a real one on.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Some people can even get offended if you ask them to wear a mask  #CoronavirusIndia #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Someone needs to tell Dr. Birx that “wear a scarf” is NOT the best way to prevent the spread of Coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Son comes home from gym Me: Did you wear a mask? Son: No, it's too hard to work out. Me: How r u gonna NOT wear a mask & then come back here? Son: Fine! I won't ever go to the gym. Want me to sleep in my car? Me:......... How TF am I the bad guy in this? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Sorry dude but you are factually incorrect and your comments will bring harm to humans. EVERYONE wear a frickin mask and stop listening to oddballs with goofy opinions. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Speaking of deaths, how is #COVIDー19 going? Why aren't you wearing a mask to set an example for your followers? #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Start with the #covidiots protesting wearing masks.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Stay the hell away from my door you selfish, non-mask wearing assholes.   #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Still, I was the only person in B&Q earlier on wearing a mask, staff included. What is it with people? Do they not care about those around them? #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Stop "considering" & mandate masks already. Most people who aren't wearing masks aren't going to w/out a mandate. Conspiracy theories, politics, & "personal freedoms" get in the way of protecting others. What right do people have to infect or even kill me/others? #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Stop pretending that you care about others when you refuse to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Stores have a right to ask people to #WearAMask in the same way they can ask you to wear a shirt or shoes. A store is private property, they set the rules. Why is this a big deal? I don't see people freaking out because they have to wear shoes at the store. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	TIL masks that tie behind your head don’t work well with wavy hair or ponytails. living that messy bun life forever. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	TX, AZ, CA  I get that 2020 SUCKS! but if you want to see 2021 WEAR A FUCKING MASK WASH YOUR DAMN HANDS!! STAY 6 FEET APART #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Tell that to your dear leader...  #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsKillingAmericans #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Thank you for protecting our state and our citizens.  Please send masks to nursing homes, care centers and other hospitals.  They are still in need.  #MasksNOW #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Thank you for providing more evidence for future historians to evaluate Dr. Birx’s role as an enabling hypocritical medical participant in the failed Trump Administration #COVID19 response. She has shredded her reputation as a medical professional at every turn. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Thank you. This is not rocket science here. People are dying. The number of people getting the virus and dying, is going to increase exponentially, especially if these idiots refuse to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Thanks phony “freedom” f’ers! Enjoy the never ending quarantine with your “participant” trophies from childhood. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	That may explain why #Impeached45 is blind to the reality of what is happening to our country. He’s wearing the mask wrong!! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	That’s why we are banned from all the science-based countries. We are the bad guys. #Covidiots #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The Coronavirus doesn’t take the summer off folks #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The fact that even Mitch McConnell knows to wear a mask and some of y’all are still trying to say masks don’t help  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The govt telling me to wear a mask is nothing...my ex told me to do much worse things, especially after the divorce. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The great debate over wearing masks continues.   Honestly, if you’re not wearing a mask n public, either for your own health or others..You don’t get to claim you are pro-life   You are just the opposite. You are fucking  selfish assholes.    #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The greatest generation went to war. This generation can't even wear a mask. #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	The irony is he sees no irony in what he and Birx are doing in this photo. #SocialDistance #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The irony these are the same people who love taking away a woman’s choice of what she can do with her body. Just wear the damn mask! It’s not your choice when by ignoring orders you infect the public with a virus. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The last time I came to Costco my mask was the only one in sight. Today, every double person in a packed warehouse is wearing one. As one man put it, "I'll wear a mask, but they're lucky I put pants on." So proud of #Oregon right now. #COVID19 #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	The people who refuse to wear masks Bc “you can’t tell me what to do! My freedoms” really don’t care about freedom. If they hate someone “taking away their freedom” why are they allowed to take away my freedom of being safe from you? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The problem is the masks protect us from them. Why is every damn republican so selfish and rude? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The same guys who are saying it's hard to breath in a mask are probably the same guys who say condoms are too tight because they are so huge #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The small state of SC is trying its' best to catch up with GA. But sure, let's keep all the bars open and no mask mandate. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The thing about wearing masks is it doesn’t work unless everyone does it. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	The toddler in chief says he has a very nice mask it's black and strong looking... he thinks he looks like the lone ranger. Please impeach the crazy motherfucker, now. I can't take much more.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	These freaks who refuse to wear masks and stay home because “my rights are being violated” have probably never served in the military or in their communities. They just want to take without giving anything except virus. #Covid_19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	These people along with Ducey's lack of strong measures will just prolong this Pandemic and lick us up from any travel for awhile . Trust Scientists  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This coronavirus is not going anywhere no time soon, stop being ignorant people and wear your freaking mask. Trump don't care nothing about your well being, please use your commonsense.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This is a sexy man with a mask! #WearTheDamnMask #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This is hard... Listen to a former sports radio host, or hear me out the world's leading expert on infectious diseases... Yea, I'll go with Anthony.  Sometimes I hate being from Texas, this is one of those times..  #coronavirus #COVID19TX #StayHome #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This is what pisses me off the most about people who claim to the Republicans. If you are pro-business and want things open, then why on earth would you not wear a mask to help save small businesses? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This is what will keep the numbers low.   A mask is so much more comfortable than a ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This is why Trump needs to wear a damn mask. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	This mask-wearing is really testing my vocal cords. Worth it though. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	This on @GOP for enabling a the Birther in Chief Trump. @gop policies created Trump. #COVID19 #maga #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Those who won’t wear a mask are the reason the virus is rapidly spreading. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	To all the Covididiots out there protesting. It may be your body but it’s NOT your choice to contaminate other people in public with your virus. So either wear the fucking mask or just stay home! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	To the guy at the supermarket who refused to wear a mask: how about you shop somewhere else next time. #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Took advantage of free Covid testing that LA County is providing for residents yesterday. Did the nasal swab (uncomfortable for a second, but didn’t hurt) on myself in my car, while awesome nurses provided support. Highly recommend. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Trump, Pence, McConnell and the Surgeon General are finally getting it. We wear masks now so we can get back to our normal lives sooner rather than later. Sadly, the change of heart may be too little too late. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	UNSCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION:  The people who don’t wear face masks are the same people who don’t use their turn signals.   #Inconsiderate #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Uh... where’s your mask? You are sitting next to each other! #WearAMaskPlease
20200702	1	Unfortunately that is just not possible. Yet to wear a mask when in public and maintaining social distancing would do wonders for a start! #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Voluntarily mask wearing is ok.   Government enforced mask wearing is not ok.   This isn’t as hard of a concept as most people make it out to be.   #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	WaRural counties, too. Lotsa Fox viewers who wont wear masks... think they are immune due to small community size. So wrong. #Remember Bubonic plague? Medieval outbreak started in cities, but entirely wiped out countless villages. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Wait. You don’t like the way she said it? She just seems like a friendly person. Not trying to be argumentative, but now people are criticizing “how it’s said” when local govt encourages us to wear masks? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Waiting for @GOtransit at Long Branch and I’m the only one with a mask. Wtf is wrong with people???#WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Was in a public park getting some hiking in this morning (wearing a mask)  saw 4 others walking... ‘one said ‘that mask is killing you sir...25% of Americans are fucking idiots who care nothing for others!! #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Watching the news this morning and hearing some heart breaking stories of Covid-19 losses.  Gets me thinking of the selfish idiots who refuse to wear a mask..  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	We NEED a national mandate to wear #Masks @GoldmanSachs ⁩ “We start by showing national mandate would likely increase face mask usage meaningfully, especially in states such as Florida & Texas where masks remain largely voluntary to date.”  #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	We are not expecting to return to our offices until next year. They believe the 2nd wave and flu season are hitting at around the same time. Def not a hoax. #science #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	We gave our privacy to Zuck.  We gave our local businesses to Bezos.  And now we’re giving our lives to a virus because we thought science would care about our toddler tantrums about masks and “muh freedom”.  We did these things.  #DeleteFacebookNow #shopsmall #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	We need some cool #celebrities to advocate for #Masks! Especially for young people. @taylorswift13 @bts_bighit and the like. How about @ChrisEvans @RobertDowneyJr and #Marvel ppl! Any other ideas? #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Wear a god damn mask. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Wear a mask. It’s not hard. Do the right thing. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Wearing a mask is not an option, wear a mask, period. Who cares what you look like, wear a mask or you might not be looking at yourself much longer #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Wearing at mask at work is not to give myself confidence. It is to not spread my potential illnesses to my patients and to help keep some fluid splatters off of my nose and mouth area. Masks are so we do not spread diseases to other people. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Wearing masks is a sign that you care for others and yourself.  Wearing masks is also a sign of respect for life. You’re doing a great job for us Gavin we are lucky to have you especially now.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	What a baby ... #COVID19 is not a joke people it is real an thanks to the incompetence of @realDonaldTrump an @FoxFriendsFirst they think it is political issue an ir is not  Ask yourself you wanna get #covid19?  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	What an asshole! We can’t do anything right in this state...we continue to be the laughing stock nationally and it’s all because we have no leadership! @POTUS #missouri #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	What do you know!!! Light bulbs are coming on in the heads of SOME  Repubs to wear masks!  Took Dems to show them!   #wearMasks.   #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	What if I told you that by wearing those ugly croc shoes would lower your chances of having seasonal allergies by 70%... would you wear em?  Of course you would. Some of y'all wear those ugly ass shoes already without being asked. Wear a mask.  #MaskUpAZ #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	When I get something like a “chest cold” I get winded walking from the back of the house to the front. I have my own nebulizer.   I just wore a mask for an hour (with my nose covered). I HAD NO ISSUES. 2/4 #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	When I wear a mask, I'm saying "I care about you and I want you to live." And I'll keep my face covered until I know everyone is safe.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Where are your masks??? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Where the frig r the masks???? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Where’s your mask, Melania?    JUST being a model isn’t enough.  You need to model behavior that will keep Americans safe.    #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Why isn’t there a mandate for masks across the country? We’re so screwed. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Why wouldn’t wear a mask?  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	With asthma I’ve worn dozens of helmets, masks, and mouth pieces that restricted breathing during sports/exercise in +90 degree heat for hours. Repeatedly.   Y’all are fine #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Without a mask = Sickness or massive hospital bills or death With a mask = priceless  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Without the beautiful climate, empty of the wealthy, retirees and tourists. It would be just another poor redneck state like Kentucky.  #DeSantisFailedFlorida and they'd still re-elect him, shades of #MoscowMitch.  #StayAtHome #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Wow! A Republican trying to encourage mask wearing!  Thank you and welcome to reality, #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200702	1	Wow! Record coronavirus death toll! 127,485 Americans dead. Cases on the rise. And you’re doing absolutely nothing about it. You want credit for something. Take charge. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Yeah, thanks Orange County for all those protests on not wearing a mask, now look where we are! Thanks for nothing!  #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives
20200702	1	Yes  #WearAMask It's like a border wall but for your face. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Yes because Texans won't wear masks because their orange dung beetle spirit animal won't wear one. Fu** me. I wear mine to protect these idiots who don't give a good goddamn about me. It's the atheist in me I guess. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Yes it is,until vaccine can be developed.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Yes!  Kick #VanillaIce 's ASS for being a dumbass in 2020!  #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Yes, it’s harder for me to breathe when I wear a mask than when I don’t.   But you know what made it even harder than that?  Having #COVID19.  #COVIDsurvivor #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	You know what cool as fuck. Ninjas. They’re all badass sneaking around not getting caught. When they drop that smoke bong and disappear it’s so cool. Good thing they have a mask to kee the smoke from knocking them out. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	You know who wear masks? Black people. I see y’all!!! Y’all really out here thinking about others and not just yourselves. Y’all the real MVP’s. #WearADamnMask

20200702	1	You're so right Eoin!I'm in Ohio.The cases & deaths are climbing. Hot spots near to me hearing of cases too close for comfort & still ppl servicing the public like rideshares, buses, etc. no masks.Everyday folk too. Ok they get uncomfortable. #BooTheHellHoo Just #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Your freedom to not wear a mask is the same as every store and restaurant's freedom to not let you in the door. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	Your party won’t wear a freaking mask because your daddy doesn’t like how he looks.  People are dead and dying because of it.  Burning a piece of cloth is literally the last damn thing I care about because I like the majority of Americans put lives before this.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	You’re not “practicing your rights” if you don’t wear a mask. You’re just being a bad human. Also, bringing your family out to restaurants or crowded spaces isn’t “enjoying life.” It’s just means you’re too damn scared to read the news. #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	hmmmm had a mask on  I have asthma and I can still breath.#WearADamnMask
20200702	1	how many of the people complaining about not breathing well while wearing a mask, breathe just fine wearing their white hoods? #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	it’s incredible to see that countries in Europe and Asia are back to a sense of normalcy, meanwhile, cases continue to spike in the US. Americans need to stop politicizing the usage of a mask! this is so frustrating. Stop being so SELFISH and stupid.  #WearADamnMask
20200702	1	so If you refuse to wear mask in the middle of this pandemic crisis, you're a "covidiot"! So mask up, bitches! #WearADamnMask

20200707	0	Notice how this "mayor" is accusing the American people of speading the ChinaVirus for enjoying life that the Chinese Communists released on the world. Its not our fault guy. We are Americans. We tried it your way, now we will do it our way.  #NoMask

20200707	0	They DO NOT reduce viral load. Correct that it actually only takes like .2% of our oxygen saturation. The mask itself,  is to further scare people from a virus with relatively low death rates. It is itself a false scare story.  #SayNoToBillGates #SayNoToMasks

20200707	1	A bunch of yt ladies are lamenting on fb, so worried about being "yelled at by all the Karens" for refusing to wear the masks that are soon to be mandatory in our region #UmYouAreTheKaren #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Agreed - and the most bullish thing for markets would be a mandatory mask law where you don't even need lockdowns because there would be no outbreaks... unbelievable how the lowest cost, least intrusive and yet most effective method constantly gets overlooked! #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Amen! I am always wearing a mask, gloves and I use disinfectant. And not even once I thought that it "takes away my freedom". I changed my profile picture because this is how you would see me- in a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	And no words that I have can undo the harm of her "expert" advice.  Still, there is a new ordinance going into effect tomorrow evening. It's going to be contentious and exhausting. But honestly, I feel relieved. If even just a little bit.  #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	And then there’s the financial ruin that the lifesaving medical care means for so many families due to our grievously broken healthcare/insurance system. If wearing a mask doesn’t appeal to your sense of ethics, maybe it can appeal to your regard for economics? #WearAMaskPlease

20200707	1	Are we the only country on the planet protesting against Covid-19, a global Pandemic, by refusing to wear masks? I'm baffled beyond belief at such Lunacy. No wonder we're banned from going to Europe, and almost every other major country on the globe!  #WearADamnMask

20200707	1	Both COVID-19 & the flu are respiratory illnesses. But, COVID-19 is NOT the flu. Research states that COVID-19 spreads easier & has a higher death rate than the flu. The fatality rate is estimated to be 10x higher for COVID-19 than the flu. #WearADamnMask

20200707	1	CLICK IT OR TICKET! If they can mandate wearing seatbelts, they can mandate wearing masks in public. Treat it just like a seatbelt violation. First offence, $500 fine. Second, $1,000 fine. That includes improper wearing of a mask. No chin strapping. #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Can someone please tell me why it's so hard to wear a mask? I understand some people have health issues but other people like myself shouldn't have to suffer the wrath of COVID-19 because of your ignorance. Wear a damn mask! #COVID19 #MaskItUp #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask

20200707	1	I can’t visit my son in his group home. Haven’t hugged him since March.  And people are exercising their god-given right to stand against tyranny, refusing to wear a damn mask in WalMart to buy f’ing beer.  I’m completely out of patience with idiots at this point. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I don’t write on here much. But I have every single symptom of #COVIDー19 & I’m scared. I get tested Wed.-results won’t come back for 5-7 days. I ALWAYS wear a mask & only go out for groceries, but I live in #Florida the new epicenter cuz we opened too soon. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I hate wearing masks and I'm not 100% convinced of this effectiveness. BUT I WEAR A MASK. I WEAR A MASK. BE RESPONSIBLE. AND PLEASE DON'T VOTE FOR KANYE WTF.   #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I have been going to restaurants... wearing a mask and using disenfectant... now that things are getting worse I realize I'm part of the problem and will go back to ordering take out. #StayHomeSaveLives #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I have been in medical offices a few times recently, and the strictness of their sanitizing and mask-wearing policies were eye-opening. WHY are medical professionals so adamant about protection???? B/C they know Covid is NO JOKE! #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I have no questions to ask relative to masks being “ineffective and bad for our health..” That is gibberish and not based on facts. You’re drinking the Kool-aid that your buddy @realDonaldTrump is serving up. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I know this happened in Canada, I’m Canadian.  It doesn’t help that your president says the virus is a hoax and that some politicians here say the same.  She has been properly censured and denied entry to the hospital. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I know this isn't an original question, but I am really curious how many women are against wearing a mask but are totally fine with people trying to legislate control of their uteruses? #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I live in the Philippines. Masks mandatory for 3 months now. It is impossible to go shopping, do banking, or enter any institution without one. Temperature checks & hand sanitizer also mandatory.  NOBODY COMPLAINS  TOTAL pandemic cases so far 46,500 : deaths 1303  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I love all of y’all, you guys all know that.  But we have GOT to do better for the good of ALL.  Repeat after me:   I AM my brothers’ & sisters’ keeper.   Because YOU ARE.  Then:  #StayHome #WashYourHands #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I love wearing masks. No man has told me to smile in months. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I never ceases to amaze me, how people will contort themselves into pretzels coming up with reasons why they shouldn’t or “can’t” wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I seriously think a person could walk by me bare-ass-naked and all I’d notice is if they’re wearing a mask!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	I still can't believe how many people don't wear a mask in a supermarket.. One of the worst places to catch the virus.. The govement should have made it mandatory. #coronavirus #UKGovernment @BorisJohnson #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I think the mark of the best is when people hate their fellow citizens so much that they actively try to kill them By not wearing a mask   They will destroy their own business’s by doing that, but that is their choice   #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I think wearing a mask is stupid and it might not even really help but it’s not about me. I wear one regardless of how I feel because I care for my neighbor. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I think you should get a family members permission to show someone with a vent. Noone will like that pic. Scary seeing a vent. Mask it or Casket! #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I want @7eleven  to mask up its stores so my #amazinghubby can have his #dailycoffee again. #ThisisLOVE #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	I will not go into a store or into a public environment without wearing a mask. It doesn't matter if I have a hard time breathing with it on or not. It's not just about me. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I would recommend Tad's novels to anyone interested in Fantasy and anyone who needs to escape into the world of Osten Ard for a little while. If you want to join my book club, we're on Discord and you can DM me.  #ostenard #books #fantasy #Reading #StayHomeStaySafe #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I'm pleased that we just passed an emergency mask ordinance tonight at our Worthington City Council meeting @WorthingtonOhio #inWorthington #thingsthatmatter It goes into effect at 8:00 am tomorrow July 7, 2020. #InThisTogether #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	I've been inside for just over four months. I literally have not set foot outside of my apartment unit. If I can do that... you can wear a mask every single time you walk out your door. #COVIDー19 #stayhome #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	If 80% of us would have worn masks from the very beginning of this, it would be over now. Thanks, Karens.  #MaskUp #Masks #KarenStrikesAgain #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	If masks don’t work.. why, every time I’ve had flu-like symptoms in years past, has the medical facility required me to wear a mask? #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	If the GOP wants to politicize the wearing of masks, it might backfire if their constituents if they are too sick, or too dead to VOTE. #BlueLove #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	If you aren't willing to wear a mask in indoor environments that aren't your house, stay in your house. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	If you can’t obey the policy of wearing a mask go live somewhere else Canada is not for you.  I went to the hospital I wore a mask simple and I got treated. Who do you think you are endangering the lives of others and all your hate of my country, #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	If you don't wear a mask in public you hate football.  @NCAAFootball #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	If you think the masks are bad, you’re really going to hate the ventilator. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	If you walk into an ER wielding a gun, you're also going to be denied healthcare. It doesnt mean you're being discriminated against. #learnsomerespect #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Imagine hating your fellow citizens so much that you would chose the kill them rather that wear a mask   Anti-Patriotic  Anti-American   #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	In comparison that’s almost the whole population of Scotland. Let’s all keep doing the right thing and not end up back in this situation! I don’t think our hearts or economy could withstand another long lockdown! #FACTS #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	It shouldn't take the possibility of the Nationals or the Blues or FC Dallas forfeiting a season to get people to care about #coronavirus. 130,000 dead Americans should have been more than enough. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	It's amazing how wearing a mask has been turned into a polarizing issue - a fake a civil liberties issue by Republican politicians.  It's a real shame.  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	It's beyond stressful to buy a house during the #COVID19. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Stay put as long as possible and #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	It's easier to breathe through a mask than through a ventilator  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	It’s a mask. It’s not Washington crossing the Potomac. Shut up and wear the damned #Masks. You wear pants in stores because it’s required and don’t bitch about your rights. Jesus H. Christ. #MaskUp #MasksOn
20200707	1	It’s not that they don’t want to wear a mask, they just don’t want anyone telling them what to do. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I’m sorry but you’re telling me you expect the government to tell me what I can and cannot do with my body, but to not  tell me to wear a mask?? #thisisamenssociety #prochoice #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I’m sorry, but has no one surprised that people don’t want to wear a mask to protect others ever had sex???#JustLikeACondom #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I’ve been practicing law for 36 years, which involves extensive use and reading of the Constitution, and I’ve yet to come across the provision that gives you the right not to wear a mask in a pandemic. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	I’ve never felt luckier to live in Colorado where we all vote by mail and our leaders took COVID-19 serious from the start  #WearADamnMask

20200707	1	Just finished walking Jon Snow and am learning about @A_Hooper25 ‘s arduous COVID-19 fight. She’s 23 years old. TWENTY-THREE! Sending her lots of strength #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Just look at what bigot Trump and FOX “news” propaganda station has done to gullible racist Americans. That fake news station should be taken off the air immediately. @foxnewstalk #COVID19 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Just wear a damn mask. I have family and friends who work retail. They have to wear a mask all day while they work all they’re asking is for you to wear one for the 30 or so minutes you shop. They don’t wish to have you breathing all over ever product they sell. #WearAMaskPlease
20200707	1	Just. Wear. The. Mask.   Unless you’re at home, or alone in your car, #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Let’s hear it for the kids #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Likely they are wearing masks. And being outdoors minimizes the risk. Protest after protest has proven wearing masks & being outdoors is key. No spikes  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Local governments across #HD24 and Central Ohio are leading on implementing mask requirements to slow the alarming spread of #COVIDー19 in our community.    @ColumbusGov  @HilliardGov  @CityofUA  @WorthingtonOhio  @DublinOhio #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Mandate Masks !!!!!! #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Mandate masks because people are not voluntarily cooperating. How about talking about keeping people safe instead of just worrying about football? #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Masks & social distancing would also allow us to reopen the economy more broadly.  Many manufacturers could reopen, meat processing plants would have fewer positive cases & less spread of the virus.  It's mainly restaurants & bars that would suffer and benefit from aid #MasksOn
20200707	1	Masks are working to reduce the spread.  If you want to return to your pre-COVID way of life sooner you will wear one.  Stop being so selfish.   #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Maybe one thing that you guys in Texas need to do is get people to not congregate so many numbers together, so you can lower your numbers....? #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	More tests only = more case because there ARE MORE PEOPLE INFECTED!!!  Now you know why he loves the poorly educated.  P.S. if you don't get tested for cardiovascular disease, you can still die of a heart attack.   #WashYourHands #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	My body My choice does not apply here, it’s my body you’re affecting by not wearing a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	My favourite new hobby is arguing with people who try to convince me that they have valid reasons for not wearing masks.There is something so satisfying about it. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	My husband and I have been wearing a mask since March. We are not out often and even now with being in phase 3 of opening up we continue to practice all the required steps to keep ourselves safe as well as anyone with whom we come into contact. Thx Sher for caring #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	My son called me from AZ last night. He has a low grade fever and chest tightness. Needless to say I'm terrified. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #COVIDー19 #GOPCowards #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	NOT wearing a mask is most likely a sign that you are not getting enough oxygen to your brain. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Never fails to amaze me how many medical 'experts' there are out there talking about the dangers of vaccines and masks  Can we please stop giving these people a platform? #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	New England Journal of Medicine:  "Wearing a mask outside healthcare facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."   #NoMasks #NoMask  Nope: #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	No fucking way is my kid going back. Online it is. As hard as it will be.  #GeeThanksTrump #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpHasNoPlan #COVID19 #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Non-maskers are the drunk drivers of the pandemic world.              Masks make it harder to breath = I’m okay to drive-really.   #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Now protect us by issuing mask mandate! #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Only 3 active covid cases in our county! Yay! Only 30% of people wearing masks now. Boooooo! #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	PSA: Sharing scientific information to prevent catastrophe is not fear mongering.   Stay informed. Do your part to prevent catastrophe. In between panic and disregard is reasonable action. #stayhome #COVIDー19 #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	PSA: if you wear a mask it needs to cover your nose and mouth. Not one or the other.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Please mandate masks. #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Please wear a mask Melbournians. #WearAMaskPlease
20200707	1	Protesting, given what's at STAKE, vs. Going to a state fair are NOT the same. If u r dying to go to a fair, find another. And wear a mask! Thanks #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Put together federal coronavirus response teams that will help get this pandemic under control.  Including mask laws with teeth.  #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Ran around Lake Merritt & it was hard af. Not because I wore a mask but bc i took several weeks off from running. Moral of the story: #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Really? And I guess you know everyone. My friend died of covid 3 weeks ago. My sister had it and was extremely ill, my friends had it- the dad, mom and both daughters. It’s not a hoax!! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Reasons why wearing a mask is actually great- 1. Nobody telling u to smile more 2. Makes u feel ~mysterious~ 3. Masks just on halloween? not anymore! spOoKy 4. Ur kind of like a healthcare hero the way ur mask LITERALLY SAVES LIVES WEAR UR FUCKING MASKS U NITWITS #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Remember what happened during the measles outbreak? Unvaxxed and undervaxxed families frantically came to the clinic to get their 10 year old’s first vaccine. What happened to the natural herd immunity you guys swore by? #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Schools won’t open in the fall, not because of “Democrats” but because of Trump’s lack of leadership and Americans inability to be inconvenienced. Numbers climbing rapidly in US, under control everywhere else #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Selfish people with no understanding of science would go into public without a mask! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Sending good vibes 2 u! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Shame on @FoodLion for putting their minimum wage employees at risk by not making wearing a face mask for customers their store policy as it is a state mendated requirement in state of North Carolina.  Won’t be shopping their again .  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	She's not a hypocrite. Wearing a mask is for the health and safety of everyone. It is not a selfish thing to do. But since you admit to being selfish...#WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Since there are those who are #antimask and there are those who #WearAMask ...instead of inventing a cure to #COVID19 let’s invent a #TimeMachine ...go back in time and eradicate #fortyfive when he was “jus-a-lil-baby” so we don’t have to argue about this shit. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	So @Walmart isn’t enforcing the MANDATORY masks while shopping in their stores? Are you kidding me??#StopTheSpread #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	So DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!    Instead of ignoring every expert, maybe:  Accelerate our testing program to keep up with the pace of our disastrous case-rate increase.  Build a smarter group test strategy.  Follow medical experts instead of doing the opposite.  And #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	So how about you enforce public mask-wearing at all times unless under 2 yrs old?  #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	So the Orioles open up the season in Boston, two hours from me and I can’t go because of coronavirus. Ugh  I hate everyone and everyone needs to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	So this fool wants to threaten and endanger healthcare workers and veterans ? Both groups are at great risk so there is that. Just saying I have lung problems because of where I served so.... #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Some people on twitter "i wear a mask everyday to hide myself from the cruel world". Some people in real life, "wear an actual mask during a global pandemic and save other peoples lives, no way you facist" #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Starting a thread for the best responses to say to someone who is throwing a fit in public because they have to #WearAMask / #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Stop nagging and WEAR A DAMN MASK! #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Superheros wear mask!  Be a superhero, #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	THE SCIENCE IS IN THE MATH:  COVID cases 0.54% and deaths 0.02% of CA population ZERO% = MASK LAW IS POLITICAL FRAUD!  There are 10 TIMES MORE DEATHS from HEART DISEASE than COVID. How many people do you see dropping dead from heart disease?  #COVIDー19 #Masks #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	TOTAL CASES (In USA) 2,886,267 44,361 New Cases* TOTAL DEATHS 129,811 235 New Deaths* *Compared to yesterday's data Straight from the CDC Don't Listen to Donald Trump. #stayhome #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Thank you @tomhanks for telling it like it is...that those who refuse to wear masks, social distance, and wash their hands are selfish morons.  They don't deserve respect. #MasksSaveLives #MasksOn
20200707	1	The @CDCgov did not exclude you when writing it's guidelines.  #coronavirus #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	The China virus?  Is that your daughter's company.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsUnwell #PutinsPuppet #WorstPresidentEver #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	The Kane and Mustafa Ali facemasks.  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	The Western media has published stories on why Japan has succeeded in holding the number of infections, as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and S. Korea. CAUSE WE ALL WEAR MASKS! #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	The first known death in the USA from #COVID19 was on February 6. On July 6, we passed 130K dead. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	The new Magat defence for when your confronted by protesters or asked by elderly women to wear a mask just scream "I FEEL THREATENED" that will justify your actions so you can get by with anything. I'm #bunkerbabytRump and I approve this message.  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	The reason #Greece was able to ride the first wave exceptionally well was bc the @PrimeministerGR lent the country’s wheel 2 @STsiodras their “Dr. Fauci”. He gave full TRUST to him&his team & in turn the citizens trusted science & complied with #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	This card is bogus as are your reasons for not wearing a mask. You know your reasons are crapola, which is why you are caring this bogus card. If you had any faith in the reasonableness of your reasons, you wouldn't need the damn card. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	This virus isn’t political. Not wearing a mask isn’t a hill people should die on. Science is real. Respect it. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Too much sun. Definitely too much sun. #COVIDIOTS +6,336 new cases yesterday for a total of 206,447… #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Tried wearing a mask while exercising. Doesn’t help. Too suffocating. Saw a mixed bag of people with & w/o masks walking/jogging/running. Don’t know what’s correct, whether to wear one or not. #maskup #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Unless you are a hospital staff member I do not want to hear from you about being tired of wearing a mask! SERIOUSLY I AM DONE!  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Unpopular opinion ²: over 90% of the world's population will likely test positive for the #coronavirus over the course of this pandemic - 1st wave, 2nd wave, etc. #BePrepared #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	WEAR A MASK... putting other people and yourself at risk ain’t cute :) #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	WHY? Do you want to kill our children and teachers, too? Old people, health care workers, transportation workers, and food industry workers weren't enough for you?  #ResignNow #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Watching @maddow. The U.S. is in major trouble. #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #stayhome #WearADamnMask #WashYourHands #EmbraceScience #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	We are back to March 17th... can we all agree that when we Re-Re-open in 1 month or 2... WE DO IT SLOWLY, STEP BY STEP... WITH RULES THAT WE ALL AGREE ON... MASK IN & OUT AND SOCIAL DISTANCING... no mask = having a gun = jail time... not just fine!!! #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	We hear a lot about the people who do not want to wear masks, but we don't hear about all the people who wear them. I had an orthodontist appointment today and everyone showed up with masks add required.  #COVID19 #coronavirus #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	We wrecked our economy, put millions out of work, blew billions of dollars, cancelled school, shut down everything for months and now all of that effort is completely wasted - all because people just won't wear masks. #MaskUp #Masks #KarenStrikesAgain #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Wear a mask and shut it!!!  Dont be selfish  You think will be on your side, absolutely not!!!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Wear a mask, my sex life depends on you. #coronavirus #MasksOn
20200707	1	Wearing a mask gives you more freedom, not less! More freedom to visit others with social distancing, more freedom to go into a store when you want, more freedom to run errands. A mask protects you so you can go back to work! It's a small hardship easily done. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Wearing a mask is a public health issue, not a political issue. Period.   #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Well, if North Carolina has to go backward and re-close indoor dining, it will be because @NC_Governor mask mandate has zero teeth and isn't being enforced anywhere. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Well... more people in my area are wearing mask with the mandate but still a HUGE number ignoring it. Also shout out to the girl puffing on her ecig in the middle of the store with her mask lifted..... #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	What do Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Iron Man all have in common? They wear a mask in public. You can, too. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	What is wrong with these people? It's just a mask. As much as I hate Trump, I have never become an irate, unhinged idiot in public. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	What kind of selfish person decides they'd rather live with a broken finger than simply wear a mask for a few minutes? So stupid. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	When either they or a family member gets the virus.  #COVIDIOTS #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing #RepublicansForBiden #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	When will the county enforce a mask mandate or adjust phase opening? Our death rate is 12% compared to orange county’s 4%. #COVID19 #coronavirus #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200707	1	Where’s your mask?!?!! #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	While I’m forced to work and be exposed to #COVID19 by potentially everyone coming to the salon I work at.  I wear my mask and gloves while servicing a client. I make every person that sit in my chair to wear a mask and if they don’t have one I give them one.  #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Whoa. I looked up from the book I’ve been reading for the last 45 minutes and according to #CNN’s #COVID19 tracker, in that brief time, 100 Americans passed away. #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	Why should we stay home? We are not too proud to wear a mask. We are putting others first. You refuse to do this one small thing so YOU STAY HOME!! #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	Wish my phone would recognize me with my face mask on. #FirstWorldProblems #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	You can make masks mandatory any time now @GovKemp @BrianKempGA #KillerKemp #TrumpVirus #GOPVirus #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	You disregard science because you’re a Trump Republican. You’re an idiot. I wear a mask because I am educated and understand it reduces my, as well as others, exposure to the COVID19 virus. No host to infect so the virus is contained. STFU you f*king moron and #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	You know what I LIKE about wearing a mask???  Only one person but me can see how long and dark my mustache hair is getting and he doesn’t even notice it.  #WearYourMask #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	You know what would piss rednecks off even more than tearing down confederate statutes? Putting masks on them! #statuelivesmatter #MasksSaveLives
20200707	1	You obviously are terribly misinformed.  I don’t know where you are getting your information, but it is absolutely wrong.  Covid 19 not only kills, but often leaves its victims with lifelong health problems.  It is nothing like the flu.#COVID19Pandemic #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	You wear a seat belt and sun block to reduce your risk of dying, but you won't wear a mask to reduce the risk of others dying? That's not a constitutional issue, that's a selfishness issue. #WearADamnMask
20200707	1	You would THINK with the proliferation of facial recognition technology  EVERYONE would eagerly wear a mask, just to protect their privacy.   If they passed a law banning face coverings in public,   EVERY last one of them would be wearing a mask due to allergies. #MasksSaveLives

20200708	1	I really wish Democrats and Republicans could work together on this ONE issue!!! It really shouldn’t be this hard! Wear a freaking mask and let’s NEVER have to shut down again! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I refuse to feel guilty or bad for being worried about Covid. If someone is going to judge me on that, then I don’t want them in my life. #staysafe #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	I understand that not everyone can wear a mask; for those of us who can, wear one and don't be a jerk about it. #MasksOn
20200708	1	I use air buds and people hear me just fine with my mask on. #scheerlies #ScheerStupidity @AndrewScheer #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I wear a mask because so many people aren't wearing masks. Below your nose doesn't count. I don't go anywhere because so many people are going everywhere. I'm #AtRisk from Americans in denial. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I wonder if he’d feel that way seeing his mask-less surgeon as he’s wheeled into the operating theater? #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	I work in ID!!! I’m well-versed on what works! There is a danger in kay people doing their own so-called research a plethora of misinformation exists. I’ll restate an itty bitty mask is ALL it takes to keep biz open & ppl employed. THAT should be your incentive! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I'm a mouth breather so these masks are helping me not look like a cave person. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Idk why people in NYC don’t wear masks.... 1 - it protects everyone AND SAVES LIVES 2 - it helps block out the smell of hot garbage and street piss 3 - you don’t have to breath in fuel from cars/buses   #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	If I can wear a mask when it’s 111 outside during the hell hot Arizona summer, you can wear one too. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If Only Some of us have been quarantining since mid -late March because we have elderly grandparents or parents. It's mindboggling that other people don't care enough about fellow Humans to just #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	If a father tells his toddler (who doesn't know better) that jumping off a bridge is good for him he'd go to jail.  Now think about @FoxNews, @TuckerCarlson, their brainwashed #MAGA audience and the #WearAMask-debate ...  #COVID19 #BESMARTBESAFE #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If cruise ships are canceling then schools should also.  Schools are just unfun, sad cruise ships. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If the group used public transportation without a mask just for the purpose of not wearing a mask during a pandemic, more than a political stunt, I would call this a murder attempt. I hope that nobody got infected #COVIDIOTS #COVID19Ontario #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	If the tree had worn a mask it would still be there. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	If they wore a mask, they could have voted. They blocked themselves by failing to comply with the rules. Maybe you have forgotten that we are in the middle of a pandemic, with Florida  being a hot spot. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If you can wear a shirt and shoes for service, you can wear a mask in Costco. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If you think wearing a mask is difficult, imagine being on a ventilator and trying to breath and fighting for your life. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If you think wearing a mask is “taking away your freedom”, I wonder what you’d think of #COVID19 “taking away your mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandma or grandpa” #onpoli #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If you won’t wear a mask because you feel it infringes on your freedom do you also park in handicap spots? If not is it out of courtesy for others or because it’s against the law? Which would you prefer when it comes to masks? #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	If y’all think breathing with a mask is hard, try breathing when Covid attacks your lungs. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	In case you think this mask/no mask crap is new, it's not. We've been here before. Try working in 80s and 90s as a public health worker trying to educate sex workers, young adults and suburban couples to wear a condom during the AIDS epidemic. Fun times. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	It happen. I full-on yelled at two people at the grocery store for not having masks. A manager saw them and did nothing, so I yelled at them. I give no fucks. Wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	It is ironic to hear some people argue against masks with “my body, my choice” when many of them oppose abortion (remember “pro choice?”). I am a bit at a loss here. Your choice not to wear a mask may kill a life. What happened to pro-life? #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	It is literally the least you can do to protect others and to slow the spread. I would rather be wrong and wear one, then be wrong by not wearing one. I want low numbers not high numbers. #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	It is not harassment.  You're justifying becoming enraged and physically confrontational bc a little old lady asked him to comply with store policy?  Medical exemptions do not exist in a pandemic - if he cannot wear a mask, he cannot be in public.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	It is the responsibility of the #ExecutiveBranch to protect the people. (,,, for ourselves and our POSTERITY ...) If you can't walk into a crowded theater and yell FIRE (a restriction on free speech), then you can damn well #WearAMask! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	It won't happen until it's mandatory. People are selfish and ignorant to the facts. #COVIDIOT #CovidTracker #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	It's a VIOLATION of personal freedom to advance political FRAUD:  COVID cases 0.81% of US population ALL but most fragile RECOVER ZERO% infection rate=NO NEED FOR MASKS!  Deaths 0.04% mostly nursing home There are 5 TIMES MORE DEATHS from HEART DISEASE than COVID #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	It's not rocket science and yet Trump and the GOP continue to resist basic math, science and human decency.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	It’s going to get a lot worse before it gets better so wear your damn mask  #COVID19 #CoronaCrisis #MaskUp #MasksOn
20200708	1	I’ll admit I need to do a better job wearing a mask. I know it’s important and it’s not about me, but others around me.  #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I’m asthmatic and claustrophobic, and things being too close to my face triggers memories of pillows pressed on my face, but I wear a mask because I understand the importance of not putting everyone else at risk! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I’m confused. People keep screaming it’s their “right” to not wear a mask. Isn’t it a store’s right to refuse service to anyone? #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	I’m glad you brought up #Constitution because IN CANADA the rule of law is a fundamental principle of Canadian democracy. The rule of law means that the law applies equally to everyone. This means you MUST OBEY A LAW EVEN IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT. Wear a mask, Karen #MasksOn
20200708	1	I’m sure doctors have managed to learn how to not drool on their patients.  We can explain it to you, we can’t understand it for you. Wear the mask sweetie and protect others and then, in turn, they may think you’re worth protecting too. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Jesus was a Liberal and thinks you need to pull your head out of your ass  #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Just got the free COVID test in Cole County. Four-minute wait in my car, three-second test. Almost as easy as wearing a mask. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	Just yesterday the GOVERNMENT upped the numbers to 200,000 dead by Nov. 1. Researchers added that we could save 40,000 of those lives IF 95% OF US WORE MASKS! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	LESS THAN A MONTH AGO we  reached 2 million cases of #COVID19 .   Less than a month ago.   Today we're at 3 million. We are NOT in a good place. And we haven't even finished the first wave.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailedAmerica #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	LOL, it's so simple, just wear a mask. Don't listen to a redneck, listen to a doctor. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	Let’s all give Ted a #follow and see if we can get him some more business for acting so quickly and so well! #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Love the mask, but @GovMikeDeWine didn’t “mandate” wearing masks yesterday, he only “announced” it. The ODOH for each red county “issued” it. DeWine caved within 24 of his mandate a couple of months ago... too concerned with Ohio Dimwittery and his image I guess! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	MY FRIEND THE VIRUS HAD DONE NOTHING. LEAVE CORONAVIRUS ALONE #Republicant #Trumplican #OrangeHitler #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	March & April ?  I don't know about that ~ I've been wearing masks since mid Feb  ~ & here in 24/7 #quarantine since Feb 27th ~ 18+ weeks  ~ I can't even get sick & go to the dr or hospital! ~ I'm @ the mercy of #Florida #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	Masks should be mandatory in all buildings in the state (other than private homes). If people want schools to reopen, if they want sports back, they need to #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Maybe if we just started spraying the No Mask Morons in the face with Lysol or Pepper Spray they'll take the fucking hint? #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Maybe the doofus hasn’t heard the breaking news: millions of doctors, nurses, dentists, construction workers, etc. wear masks ... because they work. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Me in 2019: Spend $9000 to fix some serious dental issues so I can finally have a nice smile.  2020: Always wear a mask! Me. For the greater good. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Me too and yes, I have asthma. It’s more important to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	More, because 80% are behaving as if it's over! I've been sequestered, only out about 6 times since March 1st. Survived cancer 2xs, have had shingles (brutal!) and I don't want to get sick. Just wear a fucking mask and stop congregating for fun!!! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	My boobs are bigger when I wear my mask!!! Wow...what a wonderful side effect! Well, that....and living!!! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	My father was in WWIi. My brother in Iraq twice, Afghanistan and Somalia. Both officers in the Marines. Wearing a mask is not the greatest sacrifice. People need to man up. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	My five year old niece has no problem wearing a mask. Why are adults having meltdowns #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	My husband, who falls on the autism spectrum, with sensory issues, and claustrophobia, wore a mask for 8+hrs straight while he flew across the country for work. This includes a run through Minneapolis airport to make his connection. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	My sister in Myrtle Beach had to have her appendix removed. She was admitted to the hospital on Sat & spent most of her time in a hall until they could operate at 3am on Mon. I'm sure the conditions she endured were due to COVID-19 hospitalization in her area. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	NO, he stood up for EVERY SINGLE HUMAN that the #Covidiot waterproofer puts in danger because of his snowflake little whiny babyman feelers.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Narrator: “We’re closing.” #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Never more in the time of #COVID19 should we think of Peter Marshall’s words:   “May we think of freedom, not as the right to do as we please, but as the opportunity to do what is right.”  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Next time you have a medical procedure done, tell the surgeon or health care worker not to wear a mask while working on you. Because what’s the point, right? #sarcasm #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	No mask no officiate. That simple #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	No way my granddaughter is going. Nope not happening. We are in Orlando. Disney opening this weekend. Universal Studios opened yesterday. We will soon be the Hot Bed of this Nation!! #stayhome #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Not a word today from @henrymcmaster or @PamelaEvette about the COVID-19 pandemic in SC. Shameful. #2022iscoming #leadershipvacuum #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Not sure how it hurts to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Nothing is gonna happen in the  Bitterroot when a big population feel this Pandemic is a hoax or their “rights” are taken for wearing a mask. #WearAMaskPlease #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Now my friend has Covid. He's young.  He has family he was around that he's now worried about.  He has a dry cough, sore throat, chest tightness. For now.  She chose this for him & all the other people she's been around because she didn't want to wear a mask.   #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Of course he does and his followers are covidiots too. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Oh jeez, obviously you’re all on crack. Have respect wear a mask, asthma is not affected by it. Idiots! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Okay I'm confused- is it "all lives matter" or "i'm not inconveniencing myself by wearing a mask to save vulnerable lives" ??? #AllLivesMatters #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Omg! This girl is so naive. She has no concept or understanding why we are wearing a mask. Holly shit! The ignorance in these type of people is unbelievable #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	On a bus for first time in months. 80% not wearing masks. All young women. What’s the story @dublinbusnews ?! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Our dipshit president needs to require masks. Until he does his brain dead followers will refuse. #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	PROTIP: Masks DO NOT WORK if they are in your HANDS.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	People (White) are upset about government and company mandates to wear masks in public. Governments and companies also mandate wearing pants in public but I don’t see anyone walking around with their dicks hanging out. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	People can have the virus with no symptoms, and wearing a mask is known to protect others. Cloth masks are not ideal, but they do lower the risk of being infected by a small percentage. And the percentage of protection is higher if everyone wears a mask. #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	People comment they're not wearing a mask like it's something to be proud of when in reality, these selfish fucking asswipes should be ashamed and forced to stay in their damn houses under they comply! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	People do the right thing every day with no pomp and circumstance and no praise or paparazzi.  They just make good choices.  Why can’t a man with 13 million followers and even more Marvel fans do the same?  #StayTheFHome #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	People need to GROW UP!!!  this Virus is here to stay until we have a vaccine.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	People who don’t wear a #mask on public transport cause “the government is controlling us and I AM HEALTHY I WAS TESTED LAST WEEK”  deserve the worst things imaginable. I said it. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Personal opinion: anyone who refuses to wear a mask in a restaurant establishment in common areas (lobby, restrooms, walking around) should be seated in a newly created smoking section whether they smoke or not. That is what they are fighting for... no restrictions. #MasksOn
20200708	1	Plateau? News and Epidemiologists are tweeting rising cases in Utah. Make masks mandatory in every public space! #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Please, for the love of god, STFU, you ignorant twit and obvious #COVIDIOT!  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Positives/hospitalizations are rising. Restaurants shutting down again. Majority there is no recovery but long term effects. Not a red vs blue issue. Wearing a mask helps protect your friends and neighbors and that’s American. #Covid19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	President of #Brazil, @jairbolsonaro tests positive for #coronavirus. “We’re all vulnerable to this illness."  #GetWellSoon #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	Pretty lame and disrespectful. Masks haven’t impacted my asthma one bit. And I really think a mask is MUCH better than a ventilator. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	Protect yourself and others around you. This pandemic is not over yet, but with more work it will be. Please y'all, just wear a mask in public. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	RIGHT NOW: @JeffandJennQ102 are talking with @sammarcocoroner about the science behind wearing your mask. #MasksOn
20200708	1	Remember anti maskers; wearing a mask means you don’t get identified and dragged on social media. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Remember the time when we saw someone wearing a mask and thought they were crazy? It’s the exact opposite now. #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	Right? What’s wrong with these ppl? Send kids to schools where they could catch ver. 2020 of the plague?! I don’t even have kids. But I do have my 87-year old mom living with me & I wouldn’t send her off to bingo night for fun & laughter.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	STILL Seeing way too many people in local @Walmart NOT wearing masks - even employees IMPROPERLY wearing under their noses and chins!! #KingOfPrussia #Exton #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Simple solution...WEAR A MASK.......I DONT WANT THIS STUFF..   DO YOU... ???? #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	So WHO, whom @realDonaldTrump hates because they show him up for his uselessness & stupidly on #Covid_19 are agreeing virus hangs in the air - which I, a non medic, would have presumed anyway. Make masks mandatory now. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	So hot take here. I worked in construction where dust and other airborne particles can pose a health risk. I wore a mask, sometimes for the entire day, and I never experienced symptoms of hypoxia or shortness of breath. The science is simple. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	So terrible...we need #lockdownextension and #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	So you have asthma and you don’t wear a mask and your children have asthma, that’s criminal. So I hear your hubby got fired for making an ass of himself in public, bummer. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Something AMAZING just happened.  I had to wear a mask for 2 hours straight and I DIDN'T die from CO2 poisoning.  Who'd a thunk it??  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Sources are telling me the main reason the #StateFairofTx is canceled is because they couldn’t make a mask big enough for big Tex. #bigtex #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Stop blaming the spread of the virus on young people and start calling a spade a spade:  The virus is being spread by STUPID people. Stupid people come in all ages.  In my rural Indiana town, NOBODY wears masks. Why? Because I'm surrounded by fucking idiots. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Sure, don't wear a mask, you don't have to, this is the UK. You're so cool, you made it. Wow, no mask. Way to stick it to the man. Mask free, what a legend. Hug pp.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	TREATMENT: Cognitive-behavioral therapy is particularly common and effective. Explore your feelings about masks and replace negative messages with more positive self-talk. Expose yourself to different masks -systematic desensitization.  In other words #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Taken out a contacts Trump had cornered the market on face masks lick him numb unavailable 4 first responders now there's plenty of face mask #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	Thank you @GovMikeDeWine I appreciate you requiring masks to help keep our state safe! #COVID19 #Ohio #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Thank you Governor for staying committed to keep we Pennsylvanians safe. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	That’s a cool mask!!! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	The "hunkering" definitely has changed my outlook on certain aspects of life.  #covid19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The American governments can't make people wear a mask, but they can decide what you do with your uterus.   Must be male logic.   #TrumpIsLosing #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The Northeast right now is like the junior associate at a law firm who writes a 15-page memo about why a client definitely should NOT do the thing only to have the client do the thing anyway and then the Partner expects you to clean up after them. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The President of #Brazil just confirmed he has COVID-19. I’m guessing this means things aren’t lookin too good for ANY “Girl From Ipanema” at the moment.   #wednesdaymorning #Brazil #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The fact the Gov't advice for hairdressers & beauty industry is to only wear a visor- no mask means I won't be visiting one! How does an unmasked stylist protect me sat in a chair below her/him? #Masks4All #Masks #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives #MasksOn
20200708	1	The internet told me to detox my armpits. So I am. Heard there's a cool bridge I should jump off later too... #Quarantine #WearAMaskPlease
20200708	1	The older folk at my job were just telling me about how people used to think driver's licenses and seatbelts were an infringement on their freedoms. I'm super amused because now people say the same about masks. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The overall benefit of wearing a mask greatly exceeds the inconvenience.  Why are some people so weak and whiny about it? #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The past few years, novelty and branded socks have been the bees knees. Masks are the new socks. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	The reason conservatives are so opposed to wearing a mask is because it doesn’t protect THEMSELVES more than it protects others.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	There are companies other than Costco that are requiring their customers to use masks, so why is it that Costco is the battleground for all of these morons that refuse to wear one?  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	There are policies in place and they keep sending policy reminder emails, but there are some resistant #COVIDIOTS in our midst who “forget” to put it on immediately upon entry, and after lunch, etc.  Lots of games.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	There are so many damn idiots in this comment section #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	There’s more to the story. Some of those in the beds are doctors and nurses. Do those not wearing masks really believe there will be enough #HealthcareHeroes to save us all? I doubt it. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	There’s no vaccine for Meanwhile #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	This is , but you get the point. Stop standing on your self-riotous pulpit preaching your poor values. Live your life, if you don’t want to wear a mask, be prepared to be turned away. And please do so quietly. Goodbye. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	This morning at breakfast...   My 4 yo: Mama, Spiderman wears a mask. I can’t see his mouth, but I can understand what he says. Maybe he knew about the virus.  . If my 4 yo understands, why can’t you? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	This reminds me of when seatbelts were first mandated.  Some people were resistant.  Lives have been saved with seatbelts and can be saved with mandatory masks, distancing, and hand hygiene.#MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	This should scare you all into wearing a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Those countries succeeded where you failed. #ResignNowTrump so that we can get #COVID19 under control and open schools, and everything else, back up safely. #WearADamnMask

20200708	1	Too many people not wearing a mask in town.   Wear a mask and save others from your sneezy snots and anything else you got.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Tracii, you are the damn best.   Listen to the rock god ppl and wear your damn mask.   #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	Trump administration announcing they will run around licking door handles because they are all knobs! #COVID19 is dangerous! #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	Trump finally has a way to spread COVID-19 to the liberals who choose to socially distance and #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Tucker Carlson’s history degree from Trinity College does not qualify him to comment on science and medicine. My wife’s medical degree and work as an Emergency Physician does qualify her, though, and masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Two things, ma'am. 1) I'm up here in SE Missouri and I totally want to hug your husband. #dontworryiwont 2) Could you & Husband roadtrip up here and help school my idiot, ignorant fellow Missourians on why this is so important? Including @GovParsonMO??? #COVID19 #WearADamnMask

20200708	1	USA and UK Media: why don’t you do tutorials on the news showing how to wear masks properly? Be useful for a change. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	Unfortunately we ALL have been deemed “Hall Monitor”. Wearing a mask is not full proof. Her spit from talking, breathing, sneezing touching her face effects/stresses everyone in public. Holding it in your hand doesn’t protect anyone #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Update: 65 masks made. The boys call these counts my "saving lives" number. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	Ur so-called right not 2 wear a mask is not more important than public health & safety. @letitiamontana compares it to oppressed people throughout history. Beyond ridiculous entitlement. U should have been fined. Every single one of you morons. #TOpoli #onpoli #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Want to know what I find incredibly sexy? Want to know what drives me wild? Want to know what turns my crank?  People wearing masks. Show me your pics of yourself in your mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Was a Republican; until Trump. Hilton Head has a mandatory mask requirement. The beach is not crowded and everyone is respecting space. I feel more unsafe in a grocery store. That was my point. Not all beaches are crowded. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	We GET IT! People die!   But we can prevent a few deaths from this 1 bad thing, by being selfless & making the effort to mask up & wash our hands & keep physical distance.  Not hard! Just takes a little effort and inconvenience.  I can do it while a stache cash. #MasksSaveLives

20200708	1	We could potentially lose 15 million Americans to covid-19 by ignoring it and letting it spread to 300 million of us. That is unacceptable. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	We have been lucky but not without effort by the citizens of the area.  Though far from perfect, McLean County has mostly been respectful of social distancing and masks.  It does concern me how many are maskless or not wearing them properly, some coughing. #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	We registered a #COVID19 positive case at our Quarantine Centre;Azaria Edward, male,Kenyan from Dauni Village, Makweni Nairobi, aged 33yrs,quarantined for 13days&tested +ve 6/7 2020.He awaits transfer to Kampala for lack of legal documents of entry & identity. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200708	1	Wear a seat belt— wear a mask. Wear a helmet— wear a mask. Wear a condom — wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Wearing a mask does NOT protect the wearer, it protects those around the wearer.  The mask prevents aerosolized droplets carrying virus from leaving the mask.  So not wearing a mask says that you really don't care about anyone but yourself.  Get it?  Science. #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Wearing masks is VERY Important and Helpful now ,#WearAMaskSaveALife
20200708	1	Well yes, but their citizens are better ppl than many of you Americans - they wear their masks with pride and that has helped control the spread of the virus, unlike in your country, under your “leadership”, where idiots reign supreme(ly racist and selfish). #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	We’ve lost 43 times as many souls to Covid-19 as we did to the 9/11/01 attacks.  That would be the equivalent of having daily 9/11 losses every day since Memorial Day.    Shame on us. #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	We’ve worked very hard to bring these #CoVID #s down.  Looking forward to the day when #CT has vaccine to help make it safe to visit family & friends in person!  Mask is here to stay with me! Maybe I won’t get Flu this season  #GovernorsCare #MasksSaveLives
20200708	1	What I don’t understand is how people still feel okay with themselves knowing they are potentially killing people because they are too selfish to wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	What kind of President threatens to CUT FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS? @robportman @realdonaldtrump  Of course schools need to open IF THEY’RE SAFE!  Trump doesn’t care about kids, Seniors or Anyone else  #WearADamnMask

20200708	1	Why do we mandate seat belts that potentially only protect the individual wearing them but not masks during a pandemic that protect a wider society? #Pandemics #MasksSaveLives #MasksOn

20200708	1	Why does none of these “facts” include the fact that we have a deadly virus sweeping across the nation and you tell us to NOT wear a mask? Sure the economy might be booming, but we will all be dead by end of 2020! #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask

20200708	1	Woman, if you truly believe that anyone is buying this pile of horse shit, then you're dumber than that moronic excuse speech you're giving.   If you TRULY have asthma then wearing a mask could only benefit your condition by blocking airborne particles. #WearADamnMask

20200708	1	You all know doggone well those people refusing to wear a mask& having temper tantrums still wouldn't wear a mask if trump wears one. They don't need a role model they need an attitude adjustment for starters.. #WearADamnMask

20200708	1	You don’t wear a mask because you don’t think Covid is real since you haven’t “seen” it. Yet you still worship God even though you have never seen him! #WearADamnMask #coronavirus #COVIDー19 #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200708	1	Your Rights end when another’s begins.  Since not wearing a mask affects other people, the. You cannot claim it’s a right not to wear one.  Stop being an asshole and #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Your going to have a much harder time breathing if you catch COVID-19 #WearADamnMask
20200708	1	Your right of course, and isn't that the real problem? Politicizing wearing a mask is insane. We need science, not spin. #WearADamnMask

20200709	1	Because: Carrier without mask to person wearing mask =70% contagion probability for masked person. Carrier with mask to unmasked person = 5% contagion probability for unmasked person. Both wearing a mask reduces the risk to 1.5% #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	Benefits of wearing a mask: 1) no one can see if you have something in your teeth | 2) if you wear makeup, you only need it for half your face | 3) you help prevent the spread of a life-changing and possibly life-ending virus | 4) hide rogue boogers #WearAMask #WearADamnMask

20200709	1	Do you know if you are currently carrying #COVID19 in your system?  No.  No you do not know; people tend to be asymptomatic for a week or more after contracting it.  Do you know the strangers you pass daily are infected?  No.  And neither do they.  #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200709	1	For all those who still refuse to wear a mask, the local grocery store and the main gas station in town are being shut down. Why? Because a handful of employees decided masks were stupid. Now they have #COVID19 and spread it through the community.  Was it worth it.#WearADamnMask
20200709	1	For all you #MAGA idiots and people who just ready us to wear a mask, please let me know what part of the condition and your rights are being violated? Cause you continue to say it’s illegal to force you to wear a mask when it’s not. You’re just an asshole. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Genuine question, why aren’t the @10DowningStreet government making masks mandatory in public places? With circa 600 new cases and over 100 deaths daily, why isn’t this simple rule in place? #Masks4All #MasksOn

20200709	1	History doesn’t repeat but it rhymes. Abuse of store employees enforcing #mask rules reminds me of soldiers returning from Vietnam being spit on. These decisions aren’t made at their level - don’t blame them for doing their job. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	How about the dumbing down of America and how people refuse to wear masks. Help. SOS. Can someone intervene here?! Our government is killing us. Literally. #Corona #CoronavirusUSA #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Husband runs a big box store in rural MO. No one wears masks or social distances he risks his life every day to feed our family #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I applaud the work you have done with the mask mandate. I hope your mask mandates get through to the incompetent in the White House how important it is. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	I can ugly-yawn in public behind my mask and no one will see me #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I don't know if i should believe these numbers are  decreasing or what. We're still seeing recent videos of ppl dancing in the pool at a club and acting a fool about having to wear a mask  #CoronaVirusUpdate #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I don’t get why people go through so much extra work to not wear a mask. Just wear the fucking mask. It’s that easy. At worst it’s a slight inconvenience. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I don’t know about you, but I sure love shopping in a city where even the dummies are being forced to wear masks.  Thank you @JohnTory! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I get glared at all the time for wearing a mask here on the island. I guess because we have very few cases, but I personally want to keep it that way and that’s why I wear a mask. It’s not rocket science ffs. #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	I grew up wearing masks when I was sick; it’s normal in Asia to wear masks to prevent the spread of normal diseases. We never complain. We do what’s best for the people around us. Why is it so hard for Americans to wear a goddamn mask during A GLOBAL PANDEMIC? #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I hope so. I really, really hope so.  #EndTheNightmare #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I just don’t understand the logic behind refusing to wear a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I just watched a woman in the Homegoods parking lot putting on her lipstick and then putting on her mask. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I live in a tourist area. Four restaurants, a pool and a campground have announced people need to test for the virus due to July 4 activities.   In other news, I'm never leaving my house again. #coronavirus2020 #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I look at anybody without a mask in public like I would look at a leper.  #dumbfucks #COVID__19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I love how the people that tweet “If you don’t like America, leave” Are the same people that won’t wear a mask to save Americans #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I present to you a gathering of all the "Florida Men" and "Florida Women," brought to you by the #TrumpGenocide. Hope they're all Post-COVID and have antibodies. SMH. #COVID19Pandemic #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I saw a Karen at a bottle return the other day  throwing a fit cause she didn't want to wear a mask  #KarensGoneWild #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I was the ONLY person wearing a mask in @Aldi_Ireland Limerick last night! I really do not understand it  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I wear a mask for you. You wear a mask for me. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I wear a mask to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to save lives. #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	I would be fine with that except the collateral damage these #COVIDIOTS will inflict upon innocent family, friends, medical workers, etc. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	I'll bet you're a "conservative" who refuses to wear a mask because FREEDOM and also thinks it's ok for the gov't to regulate women's reproductive choices, aren't you?  #TestandTrace #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I'm a healthcare worker and we wear masks for 9+ hours a day. This propaganda you're sharing is useless and misleading. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I'm so very sorry for your loss.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I've been thinking, and have now come to the conclusion that everyone who refuses to wear a mask because of "Freedumb!" is now giving surgeons permission not to wear one of and when they need surgery. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	ICU at capacity in FLORIDUH where @RonDeSantisFL is a failure as governor. Death rates r NOT declining, and infections r climbing. Scientists have shown #COVID19 is mutating & Floriduh wants kids back in school. Its all wrong & ppl need to #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	INTERESTING... WONDER IF HIS DEFENSE WILL BE, "I WAS IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE?"  Covid is deadly. If I were on the jury and he proffered that defense, I would find it persuasive.   NOT everyone who wears a mask fits the mold of an anti-gun, far left progressive. #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	Idiot!!!! Next time you or loved one need surgery, see how you feel if Dr says he/she won’t wear a mask because it’s not FREE.  This is a PANDEMIC!  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If Sirius Black can survivie Azkaban you can survive wearing a mask. #WearAMask #maskup #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	If a mask disgusts you, I'm guessing you have deeper problems, there are people you can talk to about it. And it's included in Obamacare at no extra charge! Bonus!  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If all of the surviving relatives and friends who have died or been disabled by #Covid19 voted for @JoeBiden ... We could save our loved ones and country from the real virus, @realDonaldTrump !  #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If my two and four year old will wear masks voluntarily, so can adults. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	If someone offered you $1 million dollars to wear a mask to save a life, would you do it? I wouldn't, because I'd do it for FREE. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	If we would all wear a mask, we could do life like normal. All you who want the economy back open need to think about that. mask = freedom NOT mask = oppression #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If you blindly follow Trump & his demented idea to open schools while cases are soaring, risking children’s lives, just resign now!! You are a danger to every single Tennessean! Lives are more important than  man-baby Trump’s evil & heartless demands! #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If you don't like wearing a mask to protect yourself or others than the simple answer is Stay the Eff Home!!  Simple #WearAMaskPlease
20200709	1	If you don't listen to the scientists & the doctors, then you are an absolute idiot, & deserve to get sick. Unfortunately, that means you'll get everyone around you sick as well, because you're a stupid dumbass who won't wear a mask. #COVIDIOTS #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If you wear a #mask in public, and I hope you do, it goes over your nose and mouth. I've seen so many people wearing them only over their mouths.  Be smarter. #COVID19 #MaskUpTexas #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	If you wear a mask and dont cover your nose, then dont wear a mask.   #MasksOn
20200709	1	If you're bitchin about having to wear a mask then you forfeit your ability to call anyone a snowflake.  Bunch of babies crying cause of a mask. #MaskUpPA #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	If your job depends on me spending my money on your product or service, but you refuse to wear a mask to help keep me and others safe, don't be surprised when your personal economy suffers. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	In 2020 the message to the American people from @realDonaldTrump has been January  wrong February wrong March wrong April wrong May wrong June wrong July wrong #Covid19 is not going away. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	In @Walmart today for the first time since Covid hit and was very disappointed that not one employee was wearing a mask. Complete failure in corporate support for the community. Do better! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	In History, brave people will be remember like this: Rosa Parks. Celebrities challenging each other to take a picture wearing a mask. So damn proud of you  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	In general, we're on our way to recovery. I think compared to other states, NY is soo much better! We need to speed up R/D for vaccine. My Prayers for the 11 people who have died due to Covid-19 #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	In yesterday’s Pensacola News Journal, there’s an article that in Milton, They’re STILL fighting social distancing and masks.  They’re fighting with government officials.  Even as they are a hotspot, yes, Even as a 16 year old is fighting for her life.   #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Is it really necessary to keep reminding the same people over and over to wear your mask when you get up from your table? It’s a simple thing really. #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	It should be that no mask, no ride.  We all must be responsible during this #COVIDー19 pandemic. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	It's 1226 CST on 09 July 2020 and  132,300 #Americans have died from #COVID19. That's:   1 WW1s 3 Korean Wars 44 Sept 11ths 787 OKC Bombings 8,820 Columbines And...  33,075x Benghazis  #RIPGOP #DumpTrump #TrumpVirus #AmericansAreFedUp #Disaster #WashYourHands #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I’m in Florida today and I was the only one with a mask.   #DeSantisLiesFloridiansDie #TrumpKillsUs #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	I’m real tired of all these grifters talking about children’s “ emotional health” as a reason to return to school. You never cared before, why now? Is there an election coming up? #stayhome #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	I’ve irritated a few people in public today. I’ve started referring to people not wearing a mask as “plague rats” Needless to say it’s not appreciated but then again, I don’t appreciate their nasty ass being in my 6 ft.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Just a reminder that even if we do get a vaccine in 2021, you probably won’t be able to get it! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Just spent an hour "practicing" wearing a mask with my 6-year-old. Not fun - it didn't kill me, but don't see how it'll work in schools. Thanks to all politicians and idiots who screwed up response to pandemic so we have to open schools unsafely! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Karen, it’s too early to deal with your foolishness about wearing a mask.   It’s a surgical center. Yes, you have to keep your mask on at all times.   No, you can’t take it off just because you are sitting by yourself.   It’s not about you, boo.   #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Largely, #COVID19 kills via respiratory failure.  It's a horrible way to die.  If you've ever held someone you love as they suffocate, and watch the light leave their eyes, you'll take precautions to protect those you care about.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Local government requirements to wear a mask is more like outlawing drunk driving and less like requiring people wear seatbelts. #COVID19 #WearAMaskPlease
20200709	1	Lots of Trump campaign people at my work this morning. Not one of them is wearing mask. But are you even surprised?  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	MFers who say my body, my choice about wearing a mask better STFU about MY body, MY choice!  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Mask in Public, YES #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Mask it  Nor Casket  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	May I ask that y’all take your message to your nearest hospital & hug a person dying from #COVID19  - I’m sure they’d appreciate it! When you’re finished try Florida I hear it’s a great place for ppl like you.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Maybe if @NFL and the teams came forward, and said if we don't tackle the #coronavirus fast. Than the whole season will be cancelled.  Maybe that will push the citizens to #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Melbourne and other aus cities should definitely be mass masking NOW. Masks need not be complicated, studies show even a simple layer of cloth covering mouth and nose and stop 99% of droplets- great source control. ANY covering is better than nothing. #masks #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	Misdemeanor assault. Fine her. Community service with a mandatory mask wearing - or, a couple of days in jail. She gets to choose. Oh yes: pay store for any damages as well. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	More people need to stand up to Trump’s insanity and that of the rest of his swamp monsters! Well done, Mayor Turner! @SylvesterTurner #itsAbouthealth #stayhome #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My 9 yo son is nonverbal autistic with severe sensory issues. When we started practicing wearing a mask he would only tolerate 5-10 seconds. This morning he lasted 8 minutes while completing some schoolwork. Progress not perfection.  #autism #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My county has run out of ICU beds and is hitting capacity for regular hospital beds. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My daughter (5) has a friend, she met her on Monday, who wears a mask all the time. Everyday, all day. My daughter told me today that she wants to wear her mask all day every day so her friend of 3 DAYS doesn’t feel alone. They are better than most of us. Please #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My daughter asked me to wear a face mask when I take our dog out into our yard to do her business. There's no one around, our yard keeps people more than six feet away from me. I did it anyway because she asked me. See how simple it is? I was asked, so I did it. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My fear is that people don’t give a flying fig, don’t wear masks, don’t social distance (is that a verb now??!)) & they blow snot all over the place.  I’ve been cooped up too long. Need to get out. Is the war over yet? (Peeks out) Nope! I’m gonna stay right here! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My girls gave me a ride home today. 5 yr old granddaughter refused to get out of the car to go into the store until she found her mask. Why can't full grown adults do the same?  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My husband and I went on an adventure over the border last weekend. We saw stores in Gurnee that would not allow shoppers in without a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	My ire grows as I see  above masks on patrons & staff @ local store. Deep breaths to calm are probably not a good idea. Told manager I’ll shop elsewhere. #WearAMask #ThursdayThoughts #masks #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	NO bad idea  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  #COVID19 #COVIDー19 #pandemic is real. #SocialDistancing Works !!!!  #COVID19 is real !! Social Distancing works ….  #RealDeal #RealTalk #MaskUp #MasksOn
20200709	1	No it doesn’t.  If you heard that there was thunder and lightning coming would you stand in a field and wait for it? You’ll answer it may not strike, and it may not, but common sense says take cover. Why is a mask so different? #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	No masks in sight in that group. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	No. Not “your body your choice”. You don’t wear a mask, you risk infecting me. My family. My parents. You selfish twit, you don’t wear a mask for you, you wear it for others. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	No. We keep getting a high number of cases daily because people are not wearing masks and keeping away from each other. The testing is not being done well enough. You are a failure. #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing #TraitorTrump #TrumpIsALaughingStock #COVIDIOTS #stayhome #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Not good, Dr. Mitchem. ICU beds here in Oklahoma are filling up fast with COVID-19 patients as well. So sad... it doesn’t have to be this way. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Not surprised.. probably 4 out of 10 don’t wear a mask ANYWHERE up here in upstate.. #frustrating #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Not to mention that having asthma puts a person at higher risk of complications so you should WANT to wear a mask to protect yourself if you have asthma.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Now, if you refuse to wear it for political reasons, I have no sympathy for you. Or if you're anti-science, or you're just an asshole. But if you just think it's uncomfortable, please try. Work at it a little bit. It's worth it! #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	Oh your favorite place to shop has a “mask only” sign.. Imagine what it felt like when it said “whites only”.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Oh, give it up, you moron.  #TrumpIsNotADoctor #TrumpDeathToll133K #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Ok the US Post office is a public building yet there are folks right and left not wearing masks. And these folks are getting close in the face of postal employees. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Okay Hamilton County, OH: It's mandatory masks Day 1. Let's see if we can get all our act together and save a few people from illness and death. Whaddaya say? Is that asking so much? #COVID19 #Ohio #publichealth #MaskUp #MasksOn #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	On their website that you must wear a mask. Signs everywhere outside saying you must wear a mask. Multiple staff at the doors to say you must wear a mask.  Not sure why these nitwits act so caught off guard, other than they were blinded by their own entitlement.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	On top of wearing a mask to work daily I’m now back to wearing glasses and the lense fog is REAL. I tripped over the same trash can twice today because my peripheral vision is GONE lol. Fun.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	One million Americans have contracted #COVID19 in the last 28 days. That makes the total three million Americans who have been infected due to the Federal Government’s refusal to lead the entire country. #TrumpVirus #GOPCowards #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #GOPDeathCult #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Or a mask attachment to a hoodie?! #CovidVic #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	People literally wear winter masks, Halloween masks, costume masks, and sports related masks longer than the mask they are asking us to wear for minutes and ppl are freaking the fuck out.   #theworldisupsidedown #itsjustamask #calmthefdown #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	People need to stop their damn whining and word salad game playing about Covid.  Mask or Ventilator: Choose   #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	People not wearing masks in public spaces seem to be full of excuses. It’s just a piece of cloth, for crying out loud. Freedom to go out comes with responsibilities. It’s not that hard. This is not the hill to die on. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	People stepping out of the home without wearing mask are just like the warriors going to win the battle without weapons.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Ppl don't realize and are not being told in order for masks to be efficient you have to be fit tested and clean shaven at the time. #COVID__19 #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Pro tip: if you follow someone on insta who posts corona conspiracy theories or anti-mask bullshit, you can report it under false information #DontPoliticizeMasks #BeAConsiderateHuman #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Producing fake Americans with Disabilities Act cards to claim you don't have to wear a mask just confirms you are the lowest tier of scum. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Read my lips: Testing is ESSENTIAL for contact tracing, isolating infected people (many are asymptomatic) and making it safe to reopen schools and the economy. Oh, and #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Rumor has it that #COVID19 causes impotence and male pattern baldness! Better #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Schools already are petri dishes of disease, so going against CDC recommendations is asinine.  #ScienceIsNotAnOpinion #VirusesAreNonpartisan #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Seems better than #Covid19 ! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	Seems to me COSTCO customers are the ones resist wearing masks.  COSTCO could step up to the plate and post signs "No Mask, NO Service."  It is the patriotic thing to do.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	She's right she doesn't have to wear a mask or have her temperature  taken.  And the dentist can throw her damn ass right out.  No shirt,  no shoes, no mask = NO ENTRANCE #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Shops have been saying for ages “No shirt, no shoes, no service” and nobody blinks an eyelid. So why are these a**holes raising a fuss over “no masks, no service” ? #noshirtnoshoesnomasknoservice #wearthedamnmask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	So many angry white people acting like toddlers about masks. It's insanity. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	So simple, it’s the least ppl can do is wear a mask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	So this is what happens when we let people decide. A relative's co-worker came into work after she found out her uncle who lives with her tested positive for #coronavirus. She doesn't wear a mask and did not tell her boss until a few days later. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	So we have freedom of choice if we want to wear a mask to stop a global virus but no choice about when our kids go to school where people get to choose if they wear a mask?  2020 is a predator. #schoolsreopening #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Some of us are really trying, but we have a lot of #COVIDIOTS here, unfortunately. #WearAMaskPlease
20200709	1	Some of you do not seem to believe medical professionals about wearing a mask, but now you have BILL NYE & TOM HANKS both beseeching you to wear them  This coming from the two nicest men in America is the closest to a sign from God as it gets. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Some of you don’t wanna wear a mask because you got stank breath & that’s not our damn fault! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Sorry for your loss. This is not a HOAX! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Starting a new nursing job in 2020 goes a little like this: A month into it you walk into the break room to eat, take off your mask, and your management sitting there realize this is the first time they’ve seen your full face. #NurseTwitter #onesentenceshift #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	Still wrong. We are far behind on testing. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Stop saying it is your “right” to wear a mask or not. Last I checked there is no mention of masks in the Constitution. Sure it’s your choice but it’s definitely a poor choice if you don’t wear one #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Stop the spread. Wear a mask!!! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Stupid. If you can’t wear a mask you’re a health threat, don’t go out. Or pay the fine and put others’ health at risk. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	TRUE! My son 28 has severe asthma he wears 2 surgical masks and a buff over that every time he goes out of the house. He can breathe! So if other people can't wear one they either full of BS or need a different kind of mask!   #mask #MaskUp #Masks4All #MaskOn #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	Thank you for sharing it, so that people know that the virus is still there and can still spread and we still have to wear masks. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Thank you. And please find a way to enforce it. Too many assholes refuse to wear masks in crowded areas. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Thanks to all you assholes who refuse to wear masks, college football is looking less likely each passing day.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	That’s not true!  They believe most of its been coming from asymptomatic people!! #coronavirus #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	The #SilentMajority Trump so fondly speaks of are the #AsymptomaticSpread #Covid_19 who go abt their day maskless, coughing & sneezing on ppl, spewing respiratory droplets & transferring #Coronavirus to others. They are Trump's BFFs & they don't even know it. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	The United States has 24.2% of the world's COVID-19 deaths and just 4.25% of the world's population. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	The fact the employees have to deal with this #COVIDIOT is so infuriating  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	The size of the problem that incenses someone directly correlates to the size of the person. I cannot fathom going into a business that asks me to wear a mask and choosing that particular hill to die on. #WearAMask #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	The stars at night, Are big and bright,       Wear a face mask, #Texas.  #MaskUpTexas #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	There are plenty in NYC NOT wearing masks.   PLENTY. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	They wore masks, except Sweden where there are a slew of dead people and their economy is no better off. You’re the President of the United States. Stop whining and encourage simple, practical solutions that will ACTUALLY get us back in track!! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	This ICU nurse has a name for people not wearing masks in public:  job security. Don't want to wear a mask? I'll see you in the ICU. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	This Trump PSA is missing something important:#WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	This isn’t a novel thought, but it is accurate I believe:  history will recognize pre- and post-COVID19.  Stay healthy and safe.  #WashYourHands #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	This isn’t an original take on masks, but it seems worth repeating: the effort, defiance and anger put forth by those who choose not to wear one in public and bitch about it on camera is incalculable compared to the ease with which it takes to simply put one on. #WearAMaskPlease
20200709	1	To anyone wearing a mask for work for 8+ hours a day... what cleanser are you using?  #help #COVID19colorado #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	To people who say wearing masks would infringe on their civil liberties: I'm elderly & have asthma & can't go anywhere because so many are unmasked. What about my freedom? Guessing you don't care. #WearADamnMask

20200709	1	Tonight’s @maddow is brutal. Thank you Rachel for covering #COVID19 !!!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Unfortunately yes.  Just found out yesterday that 4 people I know have it.  2 of them are relatives that have been arguing with other relatives about how the masks are unnecessary and that it’s all fake.  Now half of my family is having to get tested.  Smh.   #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Update your profile pic to you wearing a mask to show you support public mask wearing to combat the spread of coronavirus.  #coronavirus #covid19 #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	Uptake of mask wearing is about 65.8% in the US..... wearing one “is the right thing to do” to protect people around you....let’s reach  99% and beat this virus #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	WEAR A DAMM MASK.  Way to go Grand Rapids.  We have the highest numbers right now.  Hope all of you that don’t wear a mask are proud of yourself.  #COVIDー19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Wait, you think I'm anti-mask? ABSOLUTELY NOT. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	We were leaving the house. My 3yo wanted to leave the car when we got to our destination. He looked at me and asked where his mask was. If he can get it, adults certainly can. #WearADamnMask #COVIDー19 #WearAMaskPlease

20200709	1	Wearing a mask is intended to protect the people around you, idiot. I’m getting so tired of people like this. Just #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Welp our PO  @POTUS does luv the poorly educated aka dumb AF #racist #covidiots #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Went to my local burger king and when I got to the window- no one working there was wearing masks or gloves. Won’t be going back, like ever. #WearADamnMask

20200709	1	What part of ZERO do you not understand? ZERO% infection=NO PANDEMIC/NO NEED FOR MASKS  COVID cases are 0.68% of CA pop All but most fragile RECOVER  There are 10 TIMES MORE DEATHS from HEART DISEASE than COVID  #COVIDIOTS #WearAMask #mask #coronavirus #Corona #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	What’s the point of making masks mandatory for employees and not customers @Publix #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	What’s wrong wearing a mask I kinda like it coz I don’t wear make up anymore when I go out! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Who would have thought letting the lunatic fringe take the helm would have consequences?  #TraitorTrump #TraitorsSupportTraitorTrump #GOPDeathCult #GOPCowards #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Why don’t you #COVIDIOTS take a little time to try to understand how masks lower the transmission rate of an airborne virus? It amazes me how you prefer to listen to misinformation simply because it is consistent with your world views.    #MasksSaveLives #MaskUp #MasksOn
20200709	1	Why is it always white people raging about the mask!! #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Why is mask wearing even a debate? #goodgrief #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	With the risk of a second wave this winter and a no deal brexit, wearing a mask is the least we can do @UsdawUnion @unitetheunion @AldiUK @LidlGB #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	Ya and all the healthcare workers working tirelessly for ppl like YOU who don’t wear a mask have something to say also ...#WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Yah I bet, now you’re showing your a  Con just like the #LiarInChief you must have studied at #TrumpUniversity #StaySafe #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Yah! Same here on Seattle. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	Yeah... this was to be expected... but we saved lives with what we did... #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Yes I wear a mask!  I’m a nurse.  The public has no clue of the possibility of getting a serious fatal illness that can kill anyone if acquired.   It might be not bad for you, but it might kill a baby, child, young adult or senior.    #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You know people are complaining about Their rights!, Their freedom to choose! banking on #HerdImmunity. How do your rights out weigh other people's health. You want to gamble on herd immunity & a "coming" vaccine with my life?  Not Right! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200709	1	You know that look you give someone who just pulled out in front of you?  I give that same look to people not wearing masks right now.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You know the mask has to go over your nose too right?   Also, that protective shield between the cashier and you, may not want to poke around the side while wearing the mask as some type of chin strap.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You know there are lots. They still believe the whole thing is a hoax.#WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You know what really stifles freedom?  SUNSCREEN.  Skin cancer is a liberal hoax.   #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You know what’s a bigger inconvenience than breathing through a mask in Walmart? Hardly breathing due to a respiratory virus. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You mean if you still have a job after the spread of the #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You mean the #BlackLivesMatter protesters? We all wore masks. There's no significant uptick in #COVIDー19 infectionsin activist communities on the left.  The "I cant breathe in this mask" flat earthers protesters on the other hand.... lol  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You need to abide by the mask order so the country can get through this.  What was it that Trump supporters said to liberals? “F—ck your feelings”?  Back at you.  #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You people out there have the right not to wear a mask but keep your dumb self at home and out of stores that require masks. You do NOT have the right to put me or anyone else at risk. #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You won't wear a mask because of FREEDOM & gov't tyranny....but are fine with sending kids back to school because some dumbass politician said so... #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Your big counter argument? "You can't get pregnant through your mouth... I googled it... I learned my lesson the last time..." That you had to even had to do that just shows us what kind of clueless nitwit you are. It is equally hilarious & terrifying. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	You’re right, you do have the right to not wear a mask because it’s totally your choice...  Just like it’s a business’s right to deny you entry and service because you aren’t wearing a mask.  That door swings both ways, so don’t be an ass if you’re told to leave or #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	Y’all out here sounding REAL ignorant whining about having to wear a mask. Are you really that bent about wearing a piece of cloth over your nose and mouth if it prevents yourself or someone else from dying from this shit? #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	dear @GavinNewsom just send us all back to stage 2. I think that is what we all need in California to keep us all save and Alive! #California #COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	if masks are the miracle, why did "experts" NEVER suggested masks during  moose hunting season?  #MasksSaveLives
20200709	1	if you’re unsure of how to make a mask “work” with an outfit just look at @SpeakerPelosi that is a woman who makes her masks fashion #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	we've lived with "no shirt, no shoes, no service" for decades, i suppose merely for decorum and sanitation reasons, but requiring a mask during a global health crisis, to prevent pain, suffering and death, is somehow tyranny? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200709	1	“We’re back to square zero where we were in March in many of these locations.” - @mtosterholm re US  #COVID19 situation. “When you think of the number of people yet to be infected, we’re just at the beginning.” #WearADamnMask

20200710	0	Agreed! These fools driving ALONE in their CAR with a mask on! WTF - a special kind of stupid. And now the lemmings happily allow BrownShirt Beshear to destroy their rights. %mortality of + cases: today 3.45%; on 6/9/20 4.07% -- the trend is DOWN!! #NoMaskOnMe

20200710	0	Because masks dont work, not to mention raise co2 levels and lower your immune system...it should b a personal choice....making masks mandatory is overreach.  #masksdontwork
20200710	0	Before visiting a business, try giving them a call and say:  “Hi! Do you enforce the @NC_Governor ‘s unconstitutional and made-up mask law, or do you believe in freedom?”  Guaranteed to get a laugh, and you won’t waste your time visiting a piece of shit business.    #NoMasks

20200710	0	Christians should be concerned about mandatory masks in PA and the mandate for school children. It shames the child into believing they are a danger & separates them from others.  It is occultic & paves way for mandatory vaccines. #NoMaskMandates #NoMasks

20200710	0	I don't give a shit what Tom Hanks has to say about anything. I make my own medical choices and choose not to wear a mask. I'm tired of these celebrities and there opinions. #NoMaskOnMe
20200710	0	I hear ya! I've also not worn a mask A SINGLE TIME! I say no thanks and walk on by. If people are scared then THEY are the ones who need to mask, or shelter in place or whatever floats their boat. This is America & that's how we roll #MAGA #NoMasks
20200710	0	I refuse to impair my immune system. I am designed to breathe-freely and have no interest in complying to assuage the fear of people who believe cloth on your face is anything but a sign of willful compliance. Mask your own face. My health. My choice. #NoMask
20200710	0	I told the dude loading my groceries, at curbside pickup, he could breathe around me. He took the mask down and smiled at me. I could see he was suffocating. It was also 91 degrees. #NoMasks
20200710	0	I will not be a brainwashed sheeple to this idiot who destroyed our economy and then let our cities burn. You want to see civil unrest? Mandate masks and watch the "rocks and cows", as you called us, exercise our freedoms to refuse your mandate. #NoMaskOnMe
20200710	0	It was extremely hot and humid here today. I didnt wear a mask while walking outdoors, it would have been extremely hazardous in this heat. I stopped in Walgreens & had to put on a mask and felt like I was going pass out. #NoMasks
20200710	0	Its funny how the leftists who support abortion because women "should have a choice with their bodies" are enacting laws that require us to wear masks like we shouldn't have a choice about our own health. #COVIDIDIOTS #coronavirus #LeftistsAreAnarchists #NoMasks
20200710	0	Love the smart asses who gloat they'll never wear a mask. Hasn't been tied to your paycheck yet, huh? I'm forced to comply or no paycheck.  I experience labored breathing, headaches, fatigue and sweating. It's also causing depression in the workplace (myself included). #NoMasks
20200710	0	Mandatory mask requirements is NOT based on science. There is NO science that proves that masks stop the spread of COVID-19. There are studies, however, that prove masks do NOT stop the spread of COVID-19. They are lying to us AGAIN. Surprise, surprise! #NoMaskOnMe
20200710	0	Mandatory masks, and rising Covid19 cases... me thinks the masks don’t work!  Prolonged wearing is the cause of these new cases. #NoMasks

20200710	0	Masks don't stop you catching a virus. They are a form of mind control to keep you in fear.  They are also a trial run to see who the propaganda works on, and who it doesn't to see how many are compliant, before deciding the next moves.  #MasksOff #masksdontwork

20200710	0	You aren't very observant. Almost nobody is wearing a mask. Everyone knows you're a lunatic murderer of elderly in nursing homes, so few will be doing what you tell us to do. I'm stating openly. I'm not wearing a mask. Protests are fine, so I'm a protestor 24/7/365. #NoMaskOnMe
20200710	0	You may be asking for a choice. I'm not asking. I'm stating openly and clearly. I'm not wearing a mask. Protests are fine, so I'm now a protestor 24/7/365. #NoMaskOnMe

20200710	0	so think about it.. if masks are supposedly what #sheeple have to have, then why #antisocial distancing? it's all about control and so many are bending over to take it that having a microchip under your skin next will be easily mandated  #NoMasks

20200710	1	At yearbook distribution. Most students are in cars with masks individually. Then a bunch of 9 new alums walk by, several without masks, no social distancing and they all like into 2 cars. This is why schools can’t open for face to face in a month. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200710	1	Can’t understand why it’s not mandated to wear a mask on public transport & in all shops etc. No mask no entry! Simples Agree some folk can’t wear one but shud they then be out in public ? It really is a no brainer & not a hardship to enact #WearAMaskPlease

20200710	1	If cases keep increasing drastically then maybe yes. Ppl have to start using masks & improve on hygiene. The younger population thinks they're safe & would recover if infected but they fail to realise that they're infecting the vulnerable ppl like senior citizens. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	If people would 1) wear masks, 2) stay home 3) social distance then we would have fewer positive cases. Because they are not is WHY we do! Maybe Barron should teach you about fractions during his home schooling.  so much for being a genius! #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	If someone wants to not wear a mask because its "their risk to take" I say, sure! But if someone else doesn't want to take that risk, and you come within 6 feet of them, they should be legally allowed to shoot you dead in self defense. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	If you want a XC season, if you want a track season, or any of the sports coming up, then wear a damn mask and make sure everyone you know wears a mask. @IHSA_IL should be taking a more vocal stance imploring people to do the right thing. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	If you were even halfway competent (or your orange friend) you would have known that we could fight this off with masks, show that it would minimally affect us, and move on. Instead, we’ve got 130K+ dead and #COVID19 is just getting started. PS #WearADamnMask

20200710	1	It appears since things have reopened, people aren't keeping up with social distancing or masks...  If this keeps up, we're going to need another stay at home order before we end up like Arizona, Texas, and Florida because people cannot follow simple guidelines.  #WearADamnMask

20200710	1	Omg this utter and complete piece of garbage.  I was just at the dental office to get my teeth cleaned and I wore a mask.  It’s not that big of deal.  Geesh she is trailer trash!!!!!!  #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	People seem so surprised that 45 is saying “less testing makes the numbers look better” like he hasn’t been raving about ratings since the beginning. It’s all about saving face and looking better than everyone else no matter the cost. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	SIMPLE & CLEAR:   Face masks ARE helpful and help reduce the risk.   However no one should be forced to wear one if it causes a legitimate increased health risk.   You should also seek help for shopping/errands if you can.  Be wise. Be thoughtful.  #Masks4Canada #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	Seen many of their children out with them in the streets and at the rallies without mask. So I'm sure they'll send them to school.  #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	So science says simply wearing a mask and social distance to slow and prevent the spread of covid, lowering numbers and allowing more free flow of people. You say blow up china. That makes sense...if that is what you want whatever just #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	Thank you for everybody wearing a mask......however I’m not a doctor but I think if you are driving alone in your car, you’ll be okay if you take the mask off. But hey dude showed dedication #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	The PATIENCE these people are testing..... It is exhausting! No one has a "right" to shop, visit, receive services whenever or wherever they want! #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	The anti-science, willful ignorance is infuriating. Did they not see the anguish of Italian docs having to decide who lived or died? Now there are reports of neurological damage. If nothing else, a nationwide mask mandate would go a long way! #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	The fact that this is a headline shows what mess @realDonaldTrump is.  #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #EnemyOfThePeople #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	There are lots of pictures of politicians visiting people at their places of work and not wearing a face mask. I know it hides your face but in indoor spaces they could help reduce spread from aerosol transmission. #WearAMaskPlease
20200710	1	There are masks for people with disabilities that may be helpful- velcro, snaps, etc. (one maker is @rebirthgarments  - there are also masks with window panes so your smile can be seen).  #WearAMaskPlease
20200710	1	There are no "shithole" countries. Friends in India are concerned they will follow the lead of the US, and Brazil, in the pandemic. We've become the horror story other countries tell their people not to emulate. Everyone there wears a mask. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	They need to make their own. The public doesn’t need a surgical mask. #SocialDistancing is key. It’s not only mask. And stay out of indoor environments with groups of people #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	This is because of the extreme number of idiots here who refuse to wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask

20200710	1	WNY is doing great with mask-compliance #BeLikeNY #MasksSaveLives #WearAMaskPlease
20200710	1	We need better masks for eyeglass wearers. I always wear a mask or bandanna when I have to be anywhere near ppl, but the fogging of my glasses is often an issue with most masks unless I tape the bridge - a pain. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	Wearing a mask isn’t a sign of fear. Wearing a mask is a sign of benevolence. #WearAMaskSaveALife #MasksOn
20200710	1	What’s hilarious here is that it’s a dental office. She’s going to have a mask on for 5 f’n minutes. What a bunch of whiners. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	When I think about those brave men storming the beaches of Normandy, running face first into a hail of bullets - and doing so for their country & then compare that to these whining, megalomaniacs, who won't even wear a mask, I weep for what our country has become. #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	Why do the same doctors and nurses wear mask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200710	1	Woman not wearing mask at walmart sarcastically said " good morning Jason" when she saw me wearing my black mask while shopping. I quickly responded saying " morning Dumbelina" also without looking at her directly. Made my day!  #WearADamnMask
20200710	1	Would anyone with the right influence and sense teach the anti-maskers, without shaming them, that wearing masks helps control the spread? And hence helps reduce the number of total lockdown days.  Nobody wants more lockdowns I suppose. #MasksSaveLives
20200710	1	You can mouth ‘eat shit’ at anyone you want from behind your mask #silverlining #WearADamnMask

20200710	1	You folks are fucking crazy! No wonder we're becoming a third-world country.  We have to live with the fear of our children being gunned down at school to "preserve our freedoms" but you #morons won't wear a mask to preserve public health? #WearADamnMask

20200711	0	Even though I wear a hearing aid my hearing loss is such that I rely on lip reading- if masks become mandatory people like me will be forced into a life of isolation whilst trying to live day to day, it won’t be worth going out.#NoMask
20200711	0	Fascists are empowered by the masks they wear. Masks give them power to oppress others cuz they immediately assume they have the power of the mob behind them. Everyone should STOP WEARING MASKS NOW! #masksdontwork
20200711	0	Hey fruity liberal. I seen your new mandate on the masks. If COVID is so scary what's up with kids under 5 not having to wearing them? I know you like killing babies, but now up to age 5! Geesh you murder. Oh yeah keep putting positive covid in nursing homes. #NoMasks

20200711	0	I’m with you on that. I though Boris was a level headed politician, I’m starting to question that.  If you’re more comfortable wearing a mask for protection, then fien, wear one, but don’t force me to wear one too.  Masks only work if the person wearing it is ill.  #MasksOff
20200711	0	Make cities & counties rescind unconstitutional mandatory mask wearing.. make it optional but stop the oppression...masks dont work & actually have negative consequences...raise co2 levels & lower immune systems & have long range dangerous health consequences plus #masksdontwork
20200711	0	Masks are as well hiding our facial features which otherwise make us recognizable. By making compulsory to wear them along with the social distancing, are they trying to dehumanise and disconnect us? #MaskeyeHayır #NoToMasks #NoMasks

20200711	0	Viruses and disease have been around for a while.  If masks prevent virus and disease, why haven't humans evolved to provide one naturally?  You know, like the time we adapted a million+ years ago to have opposing thumbs.  #WearAMask #NoMask
20200711	0	Wife & I had talked about going to Cribbs Causeway shopping mall soon to get the kids some new school uniform for September & maybe have lunch.  If masks are made compulsory we'll be staying home & ordering it on line instead.  @BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet #NoMasks

20200712	0	For decades contractors, painters, medical personnel, & others wore masks to protect themselves from airborne particles. Suddenly in 2020 everyone else has to wear a mask to protect others. If masks protect from exhaling then why do these professions wear masks? #masksdontwork

20200712	0	Well folks, that weirdo #NealCavuto can skip his Viagra tonight. He finally got to see @POTUS wear a mask. The way the media reacts to this proves it’s so much more symbolic than health related. There are some crazy ass lunatics out there. #MasksOffAmerica
20200712	0	Went shopping today w/o a mask.  Clerk was probably forced to have one but, kept pulling it down to come close and talk to me so we could actually communicate.  When they backed away for "social distancing" they pulled their mask back up.  Felt bad for him.  #masksdontwork

20200713	0	N95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. It means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breathe straight out without filtration & don’t filter the air on the way out. #NoMasks
20200713	0	Ok, I’ve just gotta say it...MASKS SHOULD NOT BE FASHION STATEMENTS! If you want to wear one, that’s fine w/me but the thought that people are making & buying pattered masks is actually terrifying. Wake up and think! Wake up and fight!!! #saynotomasks #MasksOffAmerica #NoMasks

20200713	1	Hey Republicans and other #trumpanzees If you do as that orange fool in the WH tells you about #Covid_19 you will die. You are letting that fool lead you to an early grave. Now, if that’s ok with you, then go right ahead. But you dummies won’t take me with you. #WearAMask

20200713	1	How did we get to the greatest public health failure of our time?  Months ago Americans were asked to wear a mask to save a life.  Not enlist, not run into a burning building, simply wear a mask.  And America said "No".    #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200713	1	I guess I should’ve know any effort to flatten the curve that depended on an overwhelming majority of Americans to refrain from being self-centered was doomed to fail. #WearAMask

20200714	0	Do I want to where a mask? well no.  Do I see why I must where one Yes Will I where one yes because I would rather not risk my life  #NoMasks
20200714	0	Do not wear a mask, resist the draconian and fascistic nonsense, we are dehumanising each other, we are social animals, not automatons, we want to cuddle, shake hands and gather in crowds, the virus is just a part of a hidden agenda of authoritarianism #NoMasks

20200714	0	Exactly this. It's been shown that mandatory bicycle helmet laws cause a decrease in cycling rather than increase number of people cycling because the law is saying "this is a terribly dangerous activity, no helmet=death". The masks are the same, shopping=death. #NoMasks
20200714	0	Face masks in all shops is madness. We are crippling the economy for decades to come to protect the extreme margins of our society. Shield the vulnerable, everyone else, carry on #NoMasks
20200714	0	Facemasks are to become compulsory in the UK. I am now in no doubt that the government is working with not against the Globalists. #nomasks
20200714	0	Feeling very sorry for people in customer service right now. They are going to have to deal with screaming selfish people who refuse to wear a mask. Solidarity with you all. #NoMasks
20200714	0	Folk are saying masks are a 'government conspiracy', and it's like, okay... how would they benefit from that? Explain, pls. #NoMasks
20200714	0	For everyone who knows masks are a kind of government control to strip your freedom and cover up your beautiful smile (even though they can't buy enough for the NHS) - I've got good news for you! Right now I'm offering tinfoil hats at 50% off due to the pandemic scam! #NoMasks
20200714	0	For those who enjoy wearing masks, take good care of your health/immune system - because if you don't, in a few months from now, we will see how you will cope with the diseases you will develop #covid1984 #scamdemic2020 #nomasks
20200714	0	Funny how some people suddenly have underlying health issues that also somehow 'exempt' you. Wear a mask. #NoMasks
20200714	0	Get over yourselves. Those whining about having to wear masks don’t complain about wearing a seatbelt in a car, or not being able to drink drive. They’re trying to make it political, as is the case in the U.S #NoMasks
20200714	0	Getting a bit bored of this argument though. People cite as a reason for themselves not wearing one, which is illogical. Also, regardless of the benefit of the mask itself, I have found people give you a wider berth and that, my friend, is a very good reason to wear one. #NoMask
20200714	0	Go for it. Confront me. I'm a grandmother and my husband is a Dr. Neither of us will be wearing masks. Let's debate it out. #NoMasks
20200714	0	Government pays people to stay home..  *No outrage*  Government tells people to wear a piece of fabric over their face..  "Absolute outrage they can't tell us what to do this is against our human rights!"  Just wear the damn mask.  #NoMasks

20200714	0	Having been along the coast very few visitors using masks. Very few shops turning anybody away. Very few staff using them #NoMasks
20200714	0	He is seriously deluded. Increase confidence in people to shop? Has he seen the high streets lately? Deserted, primarily because people don't want to wear face masks on public transport. This is the final nail in the high street  coffin. #nomasks
20200714	0	Honestly I’m delighted to wear a mandatory mask as it will cover all the wrinkles I’ve developed from frowning during three months of homeschooling. Also, a piece of fabric is much cheaper than my lipstick and lipliner so... wins all round. #NoMasks
20200714	0	Hope this fucking idiots who refuse to weat masks in shops arent let - food or wear a mask and follow scientific advice... #NoMasks
20200714	0	How gammon do you have to be to push against the idea of protecting others?   And how come the no-maskers are all scientists all of a sudden? Science isn't stopping them going to church, so why's it stopping them wearing a face mask?   #NoMasks

20200714	0	I can’t believe people are complaining about compulsory mask-wearing infringing upon their rights. Not wearing one infringes upon others’ rights not to contract a deadly airborne infection, don’t you think? Get a mask, and a moral compass too, you selfish pricks. #NoMasks
20200714	0	I did always picture Michael Gove would one day be shrieking "you're not making me wear a mask"- but I did think it would be after a revolution, rather than in relation to going to Greggs. #NoMasks
20200714	0	I do apologise. So sorry. I wasn't aware the wearing of masks in those particular vocations were mandatory under Government legislation. And that non compliance could render them criminalised & financially penalised. My mistake!! #NoMasks
20200714	0	I don't get the cognitive dissonance between clapping for the NHS every week and painting rainbows in solidarity and refusing to wear a mask in a shop.   Why clap for people saving lives from the virus if you're happy to potentially kill them by spreading it? #NoMasks
20200714	0	I don't think masks should be mandatory. I wear one on the bus and I can't breathe properly. I see the people around me struggling just the same and I'm sure this sentiment is repeated around the country. #NoMasks
20200714	0	I feel that Boris telling us to wear face masks 4 months after the virus started, is like turning up to a baby shower wearing a condom... #facemask #NoMasks

20200714	0	I hate snowflakes. Yall I worked every weekday of this lockdown and wore a mask each day, despite the fact I’m extremely allergic to the material and you don’t see me moaning I’m cracking on with my job. You don’t want to wear a mask to the shop boohoo. Could be worse #NoMasks
20200714	0	I hate the mask mandate. More people seem like they are wearing masks. I only spotted ONE other person with no mask when I was at Walmart, besides myself. People are even wearing them in the parking lot during the 110 degree days... #masksdontwork #MasksOff
20200714	0	I have already read the usual comments. If you don't like wearing a mask, you won't like wearing a ventilator. The simple act is to save lives, bla bla bla... It's boring and as unoriginal as their homemade masks sewn out of the old scraps of pretty flowered material. #nomasks
20200714	0	I have asked the question about the threat from this disease in relation to other dangers and I am ready to listen to the answer.  You don’t know the answer and you have just attached meaningless articles about mask wearing which are pretty incomplete in themselves. #NoMasks
20200714	0	I have asthma & I wear face coverings while I run, cycle & play football & doing so has no consequence on my ability to breathe. What will impact my ability to breathe is if I catch Covid-19 from someone who refuses to wear a mask for petty & selfish reasons. #facemask #nomasks
20200714	0	I have been wearing a mask since the start of lockdown, I have ran and skated while wearing a mask while it is not as easy to breathe, it is not impossible. It may be uncomfortable but if it can HELP stop the spread, we should ALL wear one #facemask #NoMasks
20200714	0	I hope all the people refusing to wear masks in shops also refuse a mask when they’re given one to breathe in hospital #NoMasks
20200714	0	I hope the mandatory wearing of masks or face coverings backfires & people go out less and spend less money & it’s likely because it’s scaring people unnecessarily & is the usual overreaction which has happened from the start   I will risk a £100 fine & go out less  #NoMasks
20200714	0	I just thought, the idiots who don’t wanna wear a mask and increase our infections will get a £100 fine which BETTER go toward the NHS, their parking fees, and improving our NHS so the people who get infected by those idiots can get treated quicker and we can find a cure #NoMasks
20200714	0	I just wonder about the mentality of those whining and wittering about “being made” to wear masks. Crazy people. Masks are better than an ICU bed or causing the death of someone else.    It’s not a big ask to wear a mask  #NoMasks
20200714	0	I know we don’t need the masks. My little conspiracy bearing brain knows the truth, BUT I’m still gonna wear one lol, I’d rather someone’s piece of crack spit particles didn’t go in my mouth anyways. Rona or no rona I’ll wear the damn mask thanks. #NoMasks

20200714	0	I mean if you’re that desperate not to wear a mask, i hope to god you follow your own logic and refuse to take up a ventilator at the hospital and leave it for someone who actually deserves it because you’re too good for masks #NoMasks
20200714	0	I mean there is a big overlap of anti-mask people and little flag waving people but that doesn't make it political, I think it's more about IQ. #NoMasks
20200714	0	I see no reason why I as a millionaire should wear a face mask in a shopping establishment. I'm coronavirus-free and a great guy. They look and feel absurd. I won't be wearing one, fining me is irrelevant. #facemask #nomasks

20200714	0	I wonder when people will finally wake up to the madness of enforced lockdown, strict social distancing, compulsory face masks in shops and on public transport.  By then it might be too late for our high streets, small businesses, travel companies, pubs, restaurants.  #NoMasks
20200714	0	I wore a mask for the first time yesterday whilst shopping and there was a minor issue as my glasses would occasionally fog up but I'd much rather manage a minor inconvenience like that than suffer covid-19. #NoMasks

20200714	0	Interesting to see how many people are labelling those who have genuine concerns about being told to wear masks as 'far right' or 'Brexiteers'. That's part of the problem, too many are still stuck in the 'right/left paradigm'.  #NoMasks

20200714	0	It baffles me that people understand that ordinary face masks aren’t to protect YOU. They are to stop you from breathing on to other people. We know that ordinary masks aren’t sufficient. THEY STOP U FROM BREATHING ONTO OTHER PEOPLE IS IT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND? #NoMasks
20200714	0	It is not down to shopkeepers to enforce it which is absolutely fair enough, but I will be avoiding any shops which appear to be tacitly encouraging no masks.#NoMasks

20200714	0	Let's be honest, wearing masks is a pain. They're uncomfortable, you can't understand what people are saying as well, and they're not even perfect at stopping the virus.  *BUT*  They are our best way of finally getting rid of the damn pandemic and going back to normal.  #NoMasks

20200714	0	Masks only provide a false sense of security. Sick ppl stay home, the rest of us will live our lives, just like we’ve ALWAYS done. Why all of a sudden do masks “work” when they’ve never been mandated for ANY virus? We’ve taken risks our whole lives, nothing’s changed. #nomasks

20200714	0	Since masks are becoming mandatory for shopping in the UK as of the 24th of July, having not worn a mask up until this point, I'm...just gonna wear a mask. It's not rocket science, peeps. It's not just about you; it's about everyone else around you. Help your fellow man. #NoMasks

20200714	0	Yes, seeing people with their faces covered in public is unsettling, a known security risk (take off helmets/hoods in banks), and utterly at odds with our culture & values. It says "danger" the way medical masks say "sickness". #NoMasks

20200715	0	@MattHancock @BorisJohnson Kids shut out of school, deprived learning & being with friends doing what kids do all in the name of protecting their health, yet under 11s do not need to wear a mask in shops meaning their health really doesn't matter after all? Which is it? #NoMask

20200715	0	@michaelgove please try and stop this madness of mandatory mask wearing...its controlling and unnecessary. #NoMaskOnMe
20200715	0	@simondolan  If Matt Hancock has said he expects the British public to enforce mask wearing, where do those of us who wont wear one stand if a member of the mask brigade decide to try and enforce it #NoMask
20200715	0	Absolutely along with vaccines cause autism and the earth is flat.  I’ve looked on YouTube so it must be right. #NoMasks
20200715	0	After all this time, my good friend Boris has eventually cleared up the guidance about masks. Nicola sturgeon never seems to make these mistakes. Why are problems only confined to Westminster with an 80 seat majority?  #Scotland #NoMasks
20200715	0	Ah here we go again...the British public being entitled selfish fucks because they have to wear a piece of fabric over their face.  I’m just going to chip in: It’s not about you Karen. unless you want to stay at home for longer, shut your trap and wear the bloody mask. #NoMasks

20200715	0	And its a 1 offence thing. No mask? Boom, tattoo. None of this warning crap.  Its not hard to wear a mask! I have bad asthma and i pass out if i get too hot. No its not my favourite thing but i will wear one to protect others. Dont be a dick! #MaskMoaners #NoMask
20200715	0	And to reiterate - comparing wearing a mask to the practices of slavery is barbaric, racist, offensive and completely misguided.   A Karen wearing a face covering for half an hour is not the same as having your own life and the lives of your family and community stolen. #NoMask
20200715	0	Anyone else worried about the amount of plastic masks and gloves that are going to end up in landfill because of this? Or the amount of washing machines that are going to be constantly running to clean reusable masks.    #NoMasks

20200715	0	As a result of writing to my MP I'm pleased to able to confirm that he is a mask sceptic. All those of us concerned about the steady erosion of our liberties should be doing the same. I have also written on the topic to the PM, but am not holding my breath ... #NoMask

20200715	0	At least it's going to be easier to spot the "i have rights" morons, they'll be the ones not wearing a mask and most likely throwing a tantrum about not being allowed in a shop #NoMasks
20200715	0	At the supermarket yesterday I saw several people fiddling with their masks and one even holding it to his face then touching things on a shelf. If you were deliberately trying to pass on or contract the virus you couldn't do much better than that. #NoMasks

20200715	0	Blimey. Tens of thousands of avoidable deaths didn’t bother Tory members but being asked to wear a face mask for a 20 minute shop causes them to cut up their membership cards. We see you. We’ll remember this. And remind you. #NoMasks
20200715	0	Bringing in masks is just another method to ensure businesses fail. I dont have the need to go into any shop at all now. #NoMasks

20200715	0	Can't believe people are making such a fuss over wearing a piece of material over their nose & mouth for the sake of the greater good.  Where did the 'we're all in it together' spirit go? I think the common term for such people is SELFISH #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMask #NoMasks

20200715	0	Grating on about the injustice of wearing a mask (lol) is a sufficient distraction from the actual shitty things governments are doing.  Such as not acting fast enough to save lives. Defunding health services. Awarding contracts for PPE to dodgy no-show companies. #NoMask
20200715	0	Great news! This new mask law will quieten down the obese Brexiteer gammons with their massive gobs who yawp about in shops & malls all day.  They don't like the mask idea because it restricts them from waddling around drinking Monster & stuffing Wotsits in their traps. #NoMasks
20200715	0	Half the world is sleeping. Wake up before it’s too late. Be prepared for things to continue to escalate and the illusion of freedoms snatched away. Just waiting for this vaccine to be introduced. Yes I know we all die, but I’m not trying to die anytime soon. #NoMask
20200715	0	Have you ever gone up to a masked person minding their own business in a shop, and started harassing/bullying them about their mask? Me neither. Mask pushers need to back the FUCK OFF! #nomasks
20200715	0	Help plz! I saw a post of a sign on the door of a biz that told patrons if they see you without a mask they will assume you have a medical condition that they know they’re not allowed to ask you about.   I NEED TO FIND THIS - my acupuncturist wants to use! #masksdontwork
20200715	0	However if *everyone* is wearing a mask there will be less spread of the virus and everyone benefits from lower risk. You also need to maintain your distance and follow other guidance. Multiple measures are still needed. Don't be selfish and inconsiderate #WearADamnMask #NoMask

20200715	0	I don't like masks. The virus left me with breathing problems. But I wear one anyway. I have asthma. But I wear one anyway. I hate that people can't see when I smile at them. But I wear one anyway. Sometimes we do things we don't like for the sake of others. #womanup #nomasks
20200715	0	I don't mean to offend anyone but I just read that shop workers won't be wearing face masks and customers have too? Personally EVERYONE should wear one in a closed space. I definitely will be when I go back to work even if my manager says I don't have too. I will. #NoMasks

20200715	0	I was referring to the excess death rate - not the confirmed covid death rate. Given that face masks protect others from more than covid; this figure was more appropriate. #facemask #nomasks

20200715	0	Shops in the UK have a right to refuse admission and set the terms and conditions for entering their business premises, so you have a right to refuse to wear a mask, but the shops also have a right to refuse entry #MaskMoaners #NoMask
20200715	0	Simply because the cases were going down before the lockdown. Why can you not see that the govt. has a vested interest in persuading you that their actions are actually doing something? You have been conned. Get over it. #NoMask

20200725	0	It's funny it takes next to nothing to be regarded as a 'phobe'  here. An irrational fear. Can I say definitively exactly who a mask will definitely protect or indeed it presents no risk to the wearer? If not I can definitely say it is based on irrational fear, a phobia. #NoMask

20200801	0	@PlanetFitness I can’t describe how disappointed I am in your company. To require masks even for those with health issues is insane. To not allow us to cancel our membership without penalty is practically criminal. #ShameOnYou #NoMask
20200801	0	But not getting sick and dying. And wait, I thought masks work?? Thanks for helping ruin our economy. #opentexas #masksdontwork

20200801	0	Happy Friday everyone. Just want to send out a huge FUCK YOU!!! to all the stores who won't let us in without a mask. Who deny us the choice to social distance instead of wearing a suffocating mask. May the bird of paradise shit on your head! #MasksOffAmerica
20200801	0	Here we go again now #Tarrantcounty went and got stupid and extended there sheep call = (mask mandate)for another month.  Their justification is #GovAbbott hasn't discharged his fake executive order that governor don't have. And it not a law. #NoVoteNoLaw #MyBodyMyChoice #NoMask
20200801	0	I believe the mask is a hotbed of bacteria-what a joke #MasksOffAmerica
20200801	0	I have noticed that especially millennials see these face mask thing as a trendy one. Different colour, style. How pathetic is that? #NoMasks
20200801	0	I left a 46% tip at a restaurant that didn’t harass me about a mask. I walked out of @petermillar when asked to wear a mask. Businesses will learn it’s NOT A LAW if they want to stay in business. If I walk in sans mask, either take my money or I can leave, no problem. #NoMask
20200801	0	I'm sorry this link is essentially an opinion piece. Read the paper it links to & read the caveats, the paper leans towards high grade masks being useful in medical situations, it adds nothing & provides no evidence for the use of face coverings in public. #KBF #NoMasks
20200801	0	If wearing a mask makes YOU feel safe, wear it. If you're that scared, buy a spacesuit or stay home! Are you going to act like this with every virus that surfaces? The world is a scary place and you will die from something because NONE of us get out alive! #MasksOffAmerica
20200801	0	If you have to pull your cigarette out of your mouth to lecture me about the health benefits of wearing a mask, you might need to listen to a different doctor. #NoMasks

20200801	0	Last night paying for petrol at Strensham services, snotty cashier said “Can I remind you to wear a face mask in the future”. My reply.....”I’m exempt.......Exempt from bullshit” Just got a glare  #NoMasks
20200801	0	My local Tesco (Baldock) wouldn't let me in, said I had to provide evidence for a reason why I wasn't wearing a mask. So I went Sainsbury's, no proof required although I was the only one in there mask free. #UDI #NoMasks
20200801	0	Next time someone tells you to wear a mask, just respond with a confident "No." It's working. Stores are already realizing they can't enforce this. Politicians may not give up, but we can make their mask orders irrelevant. #NoMasks   Post your refusal story at #SayNoToMasks
20200801	0	Not a law!  Quit fear mongering, asshole! #nomoremasks #MasksOff
20200801	0	Our government advised the scientific evidence would be followed. It isn't. The only science that's being followed is that of individuals who have vested interests in the pharmaceutical industries! In the words of the W.H.O. ....won't get fooled again! #KBF #Plandemic #NoMasks
20200801	0	To expect students to wear masks during school is ridiculous and cruel. Try to remember being 8 yrs old. How would it have been to keep a stupid mask on? This whole administration sucks as does your unconstitutional mask mandate. #MasksOffAmerica
20200801	0	You are a very obedient comrade.  Congratulations.  You have been conditioned well.  To raise your social credit score even further, I encourage you to conduct nightly mask patrols and send reports about your neighbors' mask conduct.  #NoMasks
20200801	0	You know who is really loving the mandatory mask mandates? SEXUAL PREDATORS!!! Lurking in plain sight. Protect your children now more than ever! #NoMask
20200801	0	You will not be breathing in much more CO2 than usual unless you have a strange mask, but as said before cloth masks will allow bacteria and viruses to breed in them and unless people are very careful they can easily overload their immune system with these “germs” . #NoMaskOnMe
20200801	1	Oh fuck off. Jaysus what's more offensive a mask or the way sick and disabled people are treated by the tories through pip assessments? But Boris cares sooo much about the people, I right. Fuckin do one #NoMasks

20200801	2	Is it just a coincidence that the northern local lockdown happened at the same time as Clinton was outed as being in Epstein’s Island? Also rather hand it is Eid.  Keep red pilling, keep  and keep #NoMasks
20200801	2	Me too. Its all for political reasons, a government code-word for an experiment. #FakePandemic #NoMasks
20200802	0	@Jim_Jordan Challenging Dr. Fauci was great. But you know what would be better? If all you GOPs in Congress would get your thumbs out of your asses and stop these governors from wielding unlimited power, mandating masks and shutting down bars and restaurants. #NoMasks

20200802	0	How about if you're the person who can’t comfortably wear a mask due to a lung disease, is infected and causing the spread to those of us who are wearing a mask that we wear because it protects you? So...we both have it now  #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	0	My mate in Singapore tells me when mandatory masks came in everyone complied except some European woman walking down Orchard Road demanding her rights. Police were called and she was hauled off for MENTAL ASSESSMENT. The cops figured "Won't wear a mask = Nuts" #WearADamnMask
20200802	0	Pleasant trip into a local grocery store busier than normal unmasked patrons for outnumbered the few I did see and they were elderly one lady wearing a mask even asked for my assistance in reaching a product off the top shelf I'll be frequenting this establishment more #NoMasks

20200802	0	The left knows that personal responsibility and freedom is a valid argument to not wearing a mask. That is why they turned the narrative around to protecting other people, “If you don’t wear a mask, you want OTHER people to die!” #NoMasks
20200802	0	The thought of how we all going to die from suffocation in summer wearing a mask   Sweat isn't cute, neither is the ronas.  #summer #Covid_19 #MasksOn
20200802	0	Think @DrChrisSmith just blew away the whole #facemask argument by stating it's based on "slim evidence". So @SadiqKhan and @BorisJohnson has made this draconian law on flawed medical proof. #NoMask
20200802	0	Yeah.... Actually no, the guidance has been a joke & the why has been for corporate money making. Am over 50, v healthy, don't wear a mask (ever) or social distance (oxymoron). Won't have a vaccine, nor will I shield for a disease that's virtually gone in the UK. #KBF #NoMasks
20200802	0	Your argument; anyone who disagrees doesn't have a voice, hmm nicely fascist. If lockdown is the 'only' reason, why was one not needed for previous pandemics? So to stop numbers going up, we need to lockdown forever? Strange how a simpleton can fault your logic. #KBF #NoMasks
20200802	1	#facemasks are mostly effective when wore by the sick people. As it is difficult to know who is sick and who is not, if mass people #WearAMask in public places it can significantly reduce the spread of the virus. #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	#sundayvibes don’t consider yourself a pro life Republican if you won’t wear a mask  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	@InsidersABC @CaseyBriggs From what my Melburnian friends are reporting, the restrictions aren’t working because PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE WITHOUT MASKS & gathering in groups for picnics & sitting outside restaurants & cafes with their takeaways. #StayHomeSaveLives #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	@MassGovernor agrees and has launched a new campaign to highlight the continued importance of wearing masks   #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	A guy with no mask just knocked on my door. I have big loud dogs, he backed away. I stuck my head out and he yelled across the yard. He's selling frozen beef. Holy hell, he came to my door with no mask. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	A question to the people wearing their masks on their chins...do you think it’s doing anything  #CoverYourFace
20200802	1	Agreed nothing is perfect, but don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Bottom line, if we all wear our masks we are all significantly less likely to get sick.  Do your part and #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Am I ever going to learn that my phone doesn’t recognize me when I have my mask on? But still...#WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Another question...do the people wearing the masks below their nose know it is also connected to their lungs? #CoverYourFace
20200802	1	As of 38 minutes ago, my 3 kids and I entered day 150 of lockdown. That's 150 days that I haven't seen any of my family, friends or another adult because I'm trying to keep my #immunocompromised son safe. It makes me angry that so many people won't even wear a mask.#WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Because a lot of people STILL refuse to wear masks, and stay physically distant from others, I'm gearing up for some GREAT holidays, such as:  Hallowzoom Zoomsgiving Christzoom Zoom Year's Eve Zoomukkah Kwanzoom  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Bullshit. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Daily reminder: every time you see a person without a mask outside, remember: they're the reason this pandemic STILL isn't over yet...  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Dr Nick, I agree it’s brilliant...but I’m disappointed that so many comments here show that either people lack a sense of humour!  and/or don’t get how essential both vaccinations and mask wearing are for our survival! Shocking!  #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives #MasksOn
20200802	1	Face masks are a lot like condoms. Nobody WANTS to wear em but, you should be wearing them to keep yourself and others safe. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Finally went out after dialing it WAY back after the shutdowns.  I’m very happy to report everyone in sight is wearing a mask, socially distancing and not a single Karen/Kevin. Still a little gun shy about being out, but I am encouraged.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	For those who say #COVID19  isn't any worse than the flu, I give you MATH (but you can't really compare these 2)  2018-19 US flu season deaths were 34,200 (@CDCgov)  % increase using US CV19 deaths (157,396 SO FAR)   = 360% increase. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY PERCENT! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Go @Delta  These stories are too frequent! Mandatory mask requirement AND every airline needs to make it clear to every single passenger there WILL be prosecution with minimum of a $10,000 fine if there’s an incident regarding #Mask. Ppl need to comply w/ rules! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Great job @Delta for having the courage to kick the people who refused to wear masks off your flight! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Happy birthday  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	He's an expert, you're a failed tv host/failed businessman (who bankrupted a casino!) so I'll go with Dr. Fauci.  The US has more cases due to your FAILURE to act, FAILURE to lead #TrumpVirus #ImPOTUS #TrumpGolfsYouDie #PutinsPuppet #PutinsGOP #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Helpful hint for your gaslit trumpanzee friends (if you’re into that):  Put your mask on. Don’t mess with it. Wash your hands often.  #MasksDontKill #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Here’s the thing, I support responsible gun owner rights but if you own one for protection in case someone tries to hurt you but you won’t wear a mask, isn’t that a bit ironic? Neither one 100% guarantees your survival but it could possibly help, right? #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	Hey @MishaBotBot Please tell me you wear a mask! Everyone, even Bots have a responsibility to help slow the spread of Covid-19. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I am so fucking tired of GROWN ADULTS whining and complaining about having to wear a mask in our restaurant. I'm sorry..are you not an ADULT? is it too hard to be a fucking grown up?! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I assume all of the Sheriffs, who weren’t social distancing or wearing masks, had Covid tests the past two days to confirm multiple negative tests?   As a Republican, I know we can do better Mr. President.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I didn't know that wearing a mask and staying at home was mission impossible, like damn man. Ya'll had one job and managed to fuck it up. Smh #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I don’t need to read the article - it’s because they’re selfish and short sighted.  We’re in the middle of an out of control pandemic, what does wearing a mask hurt?!  #MaskItOrCasket #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	I don’t understand these people who will not wear a mask . Inconsiderate fools. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	I have cancer, I do not go out except for blood tests and chemo.  There are people in line at Quest with no mask, even though their sign says "no entry without a mask".  I would like to go out, shop, eat in a restaurant, but I am terrified. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I live in a state with a Democratic governor. Masks in public places have been mandatory since at least June 1.  I shopped in 3 different stores today. Everybody was masked, and I didn’t hear a single “but muh freedums.” #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I mean, I get it, a mask is uncomfortable, it fogs your glasses, it gets hot, it becomes a nuisance after wearing it for a long time; but gosh, it shouldn’t be politicized! For your heath’s sake & that of others, wear it! It may save your life. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	I see a lot of robust bellies, no masks, no life preservers. You can almost feel the covid that’s inevitable. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I will be angry if I happily man ED wearing N95 entire time, stopped counting high-risk procedures or + pts, batch shifts to sequester in hotel to protect #CHD 13yo daughter, test 9x neg, all in last 6mo only to get #COVID19 from stranger w/ no mask.  AL pls #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I'm not condoning violence, but why are all the stories about people catching a beating over masks about people who actually comply? You would think the non-mask wearers would be the ones on the run. #MaskItOrCasket #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	If Anne Frank could live in a secret annex with seven other people for two years. I can wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	If a mask mandate could help save lives and violates the law, CHANGE! THE! LAW! NOT having the mandate could actually be helping kill people, do you really want that on your shoulders @GovRicketts? #youcandoit #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	If you're not willing to wear a mask at a grocery store (even when it's mandatory), could you at least utilize their delivery or pickup options (which is often free)? You are gaining nothing. Does the thrill of walking down the cereal really mean that much to you?  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO. #MaskMoaners
20200802	1	It is because some GOP Congress people are not wearing their masks!!!For same. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	It's you vs. the virus. The ONLY way to win is to stop it from spreading by depriving it of future hosts. That means staying the fuck home and wearing a damn mask if you MUST leave the house.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	It’s good to see a shift in consumer behavior re: masks when corporations (esp. those that serve non-compliant areas) enact rules. Virtually no masks ~1mo ago at my parent’s local @Walmart. Today? >70% compliance. (Both observations based on my experience.) #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	It’s incorrect but it if makes you feel better it’s simple: stay home as much as possible, wear a fabric mask when you do have to go out and get some surgical masks if you need to be out for extended periods of time.  You’re welcome #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	It’s time for people to act responsibly. There is enough evidence that masks work. Adults shouldn’t have to be told to wear a mask. It’s not a political statement it’s what makes us all safer. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	I’m so late to the party @Twitter Please excuse me. How’s #QuarantineLife? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Just a little, they do want you to wear masks if you can, but drop them down for the lovely deaf girl. So we was served by her. #NoMask
20200802	1	LOTS of masks in the mall today. YAY!! @CornwallCentre @RealTenille #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Let's be clear: it is all our business if you are not wearing a mask in our presence. This is not just about you. You don't have a right to kill those around you. If you harm someone for reminding you to wear a mask. You will be charged. Stop being selfish!! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Look a #COVIDIOT #TrumpDeathCult member. #resist the #TrumpDeathCult they want to kill us all. @GavinNewsom @SupervisorCox @SupFletcher @ToddGloria we need protection from the virus and domestic terrorists like anti mask guy. #Gettested #StaySafeStayHome #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Look at all these people at @NASA and @SpaceX doing their jobs, keeping @Astro_Doug & @AstroBehnken safe and informed while social distancing and wearing masks. You guys rock.    #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	MEEEE EEITHERRR! Stay home~ stay alive! Social distance Wear a mask Wash hands frequently These are our only defenses And these are such simple things~ not like a series of shots in the ass! Or a double lung transplant.. #152000AmericansDead #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Man on train keeps removing mask to sneeze into hand . Man without mask has just got on and shaken hands with him ... I despair for humanity  #COVIDIOTS #facecoverings #CoverYourFace
20200802	1	More good news: 75% of healthy 45-53 yr old patients that recovered from Covid have permanent structural damage to their hearts = to a heart attack.  But masks are hot. #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	My new nightmare in my sleep is not going to jail, is not robbery or falling. My new nightmare is forgetting to wear my mask in public and dying from the coronavirus. Do me a favor, to reduce my anxiety wear a fucking mask or stay at home. Thank you. #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	Neil, stop being a snowflake and wear a mask. It won’t be forever, and it will help the most vulnerable to be protected against covid19. I wear one every day at work, it’s no big deal. #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	New York state has been wearing masks since early April. We now have very low case numbers. At one point over 300/ were dying. Now we are in the single digits. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	No mask? Careless, self-centered no concern for anyone else’s health. Don’t be like Joe #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	No, we have more cases because you said it was a hoax and no one wants to wear masks. Also teenagers are having large parties because they think they are invincible. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	No... You're not a "bad person" necessarily... you're just... obviously... tragically... not too smart. Too easily larped. This isn't D&D... a spell won't save you. Herman Cain didn't wear a mask, and now he's dead. Don't be like #HermanCain. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	None of the employees are wearing masks at @BootsUK and @SourcedMarket at @StPancrasInt ! How disrespectful to the weak and elderly. Sort it out! #Covid_19 #coronavirus #nomasks
20200802	1	Not to mention travel benefits by bringing his family on a Gov't Challenger Jet and not wearing masks whilst Ms. May and Min. Qualtrough did on board. #cdnpoli #IStandWithTrudeau #ScheerStupidity #ByeScheer #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Not true. Also, there is currently a vaccine for the flu. Why are you trying to minimize this pandemic? People are dying every minute in this country because the federal government is leaderless and has politicized the one thing that could mitigate it. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Not wearing a mask is "small dick energy."  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Now there's a guy eating an entire meal with his mask around his chin.  Is eating even allowed on @cta trains?  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Oh, so you don't want to wear a mask? Well, hey I'm not so crazy about pants, but I do whats best for my neighbors #coronavirus #MasksOn
20200802	1	On the bus. Out of the 6 people on the lower deck only 2 have their masks on properly 3 have their mouths covered but their nose poking out and one has it round their neck. Just what is the point? It’s really not that hard #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Or.... you can wear a mask when going out and near other people! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Our ancestors fought against people being gassed you complete sausage. A mask in a shop for 20 minutes is first world selfish mother fucking problems. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Over 148,000 Americans  have died. We are not showing them any respect or learning from the senseless deaths that could be avoided by wearing a mask. Obviously Washington County and other counties are failing as  #COVID19 # 's keep #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	People need to strap up and MASK up!! Americans sacrificed so much during WW2 and now they can’t even wear a mask at Target for 5 minutes without having a hissy fit!! #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	Raging at the impudence around me. I keep meeting +Covid people who don't wear a mask whose family refuses testing and wearing masks but STILL go around the community. This is not a joke your SELFISHNESS is killing your loved ones, caregivers, my friends, humanity. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	So 9 out of 10 members of Congress with Covid-19 is a Republican. Doesn’t that antidotal added to science tell you something? Covid-19 doesn’t care about your politics but the politics of the Republican Party have made it worse. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	So nobody wears a mask in South Carolina???    #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Spending the afternoon watching a 3-on-3 youth soccer tournament at @etownsportspark. Beautiful day...but a shame there’s no signage or enforcement of mask wearing. Come on...we can do better! @KYHealthAlerts #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Taking a scroll through Instagram right now...I didn’t know the pandemic was over! Congrats everyone!! Hope you enjoyed your big night out.   I’ll just huddle over here behind my mask as school starts in two weeks. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	The longer your boss and the GOP pushes not wearing a mask the longer this crisis will linger and we’ll all suffer and STILL HAVE TO WEAR A MASK. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	The realization of how many think we're nvincible to #COVID19 was never more apparent until we saw people actually walk into the funeral home with no mask defying our state order. You're literally standing with the dead all around you and you still don't get it. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	The world we live in... a simple face covering becomes another battle front in the fight for our humanity.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	These countries ISOLATED - broke the vector. The truth is studies reveal there's likely 10x more virus out there than positive testing results. DON'T BE A VECTOR... #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	These hypocrites like @KevinMcCarthyTV are still arguing about wearing masks-unbelievable  #Hypocrisy #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Tomorrow #NH will host a #NASCAR race that is expected to draw 12K.  We are the only state in the entire Norteast w/out a mask mandate. This is a potential #COVID19 superspreader event. You may be “over” the pandemic - but it’s not over you. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Turned up to our worksite to paint yesterday. 6 concreters, 2 chippies, 2 pool blokes, all without masks on and working in the one area. We walked off site and got eyes rolled at us and laughed at. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	WI Gov Evers just passed mandatory masks statewide effective today. GOP state legislators already fighting the mask law and threatening lawsuit to WI Supreme Court to overturn. New WI SC Dem Justice just took seat today. So GOP may not succeed#WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Was out at Target Express in Cupertino earlier this afternoon, noticed a shopper sans mask #WTF #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Watching the @penguins play in an empty arena is sad. Mostly because people won't wear freaking masks so this is what it has come to. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	We HAVE to start calling it out. These ppl defending not wearing masks are idiots. I have no problem w ppl's stupidity only affecting them.  But I have a BIG problem w Us All having to be at risk delayed and inconvenienced because a Ken and/or a Karen won't just #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	We NOW have Thousands of maskless churchgoers congregating together on the beaches of hot spot California. No masks. For civil liberty. I guess the constitution guarantees the Unalienable right to spread their disease.  #NoMasks
20200802	1	We've also added an event in Philadelphia and a real dumb anti-mask rally in MN.  I'm still working up a tik tok joke, but I'm only on my first cup of coffee.  Keep an eye on this thread.  #BlackLivesMatter #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Wearing a mask and social distancing doesn't mean you are "living in fear." It's like wearing a seat belt or using your headlights in the rain, it's for your safety and the safety of others.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Welp. My immuno-compromised husband & I can't go on evening walks in the park anymore because here in Pittsburgh, the HOTSPOT of PA, only about 1/3 of people are wearing masks.   Hey Pittsburgh, if you're going out, WEAR YOUR MASKS! #Pittsburgh #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	What, are they children??? Grow up ppl & wear the damn mask! This is not about politics, not about Liberty and not about YOU.  It is about 150K FELLOW AMERICANS who have NEEDLESSLY DIED bc of ignorant & selfish choices made by others.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	When Covid selects its victims I hope it targets the arrogant bell ends who refuse to wear masks in shops. Knobs!!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Why can’t people follow rules and wear a darn mask?! #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives
20200802	1	Yes, it does, a positive test without symptoms (Asymptomatic) can & has been proven to spread the virus. Thats the importance of wearing  masks, so you dont unknowingly spread the virus. #asymtomatic #COVID19 #MasksSaveLives
20200802	1	Yessssss!! What a powerful and true statement. We need this mask mandate. #Stopthespread #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200802	1	Your use of ‘Dr Fartzy’ speaks volumes about you.  Doctors and nurses survive long shifts in serious medical masks. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	that's nonsense:  masks reduce the distance water droplets from your mouth spread, thereby lowering the likelihood of the virus spreading (the virus travels in water droplets) stop your whining, stop spreading misinformation and #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	“A sleep-away camp in Georgia: Of the 600 campers and staff members, nearly half became infected within a week of orientation. The camp took precautions but did not require campers to wear masks. Singing and cheering may have helped spread the virus.” #noshit #WearADamnMask

20200802	2	Day 139 of self isolation Baked 2 apple pies. Franks swears that he only cut up 4 apples, but... There was way too much for 1 pie. Watched episode 3 of "Warrior Nun" on Netflix. Nuns I knew were kind & gentle. Frank says the ones he knew were like Sister Frances. #WearADamnMask
20200802	2	Don’t blame the governor, it is 45’s lack of leadership that has lead to these problems. Deaths didn’t start going crazy until businesses started opening up early, under pressure of federal government.  #TrumpsDeathToll157K #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #extendthe600 #WearADamnMask

20200802	2	He's only 27.  Covid-19 can have residual effects on older and younger people. #WearADamnMask
20200802	2	I ask that question often. I think some are here, just for the circus, and they may disappear. But the true resistance, has much to do, before, during, and after the election. No sleep for the vigilant fighting the wicked.  #VoteForOurLives #VoteForTheChildren #WearADamnMask
20200802	2	I just also can't understand why she accepted masks from Taiwan if she wasn't going to use them. They shipped over 20,000 face masks! #LieCheatSteel #WearADamnMask
20200802	2	I miss concerts.  Watching @RealMeatLoaf 2011 show from GUILTY PLEASURES tour final show at Sydney Entertainment Center.  But no live concerts is worth it to  #StopTheSpread of #COVID19 #WearADamnMask

20200803	0	No I wouldn't. If this was the pandemic they predicted over 10million people world wide would have died. I'm sorry for the families who have list their loved ones, however wearing a mask in a normal flu season wouldn't stop it...would it? Peace  #KeepBritainFree #NoMasks

20200803	1	1000 Americans dying per day for the next 30 days.  or  EVERYONE wears a mask... Make that shit mandatory with stiff penalties... And we can beat this virus in like 3 weeks and save 20,000 lives.  The choice should be easy but for some reason #MAGA doesn't get it.  #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	141 days into the US #COVID19 pandemic. With all the information we have about the benefit of wearing #masks, if you aren’t, you are responsible for the continued spread, deaths, illness, closures, financial ruin, and ongoing horror! #WearADamnMask

20200803	1	Didn’t u hear? Per one FL woman, she shouldn’t have 2 wear a mask 4 the same reason she doesn’t wear underwear: cause “things gotta breathe”. How many fatal underwear-wearing incidents have you heard of? And what does this lady do when it’s her time of the month? #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Do we not cover and protect various other organs from our environment? Have we evolved to have skin that doesn't burn into cancerous lesions? How many examples do you need @NeilClark66 before you understand that your opinion of mask-wearing is utter nonsense #WearADamnMask

20200803	1	I’m not religious but this little ditty popped into my head today... Maybe this will help those who proclaim to be “Christian” with wearing a mask.    “Wear a mask and say your prayers because Jesus and Corona are everywhere.”  -#WearADamnMask
20200803	1	I’m sorry for your loss. I heard someone moaning about not being able to breathe with a mask on. I believe covid doesn’t help you breathe either. I know one I would rather have and it’s not the latter #WearADamnMask

20200803	1	So its the first day of compulsory masks here and i just went to the post office and on the way i passed a girl holding her mask in her hand and then both of the staff at the post office had their masks down on their chins. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Tbh, I'll be far less mental than I am now.   I'm diabetic, and the general public are not taking this pandemic seriously enough for me to feel safe outside.  I've apparently a one in ten chance of dying if I catch Covid, so lockdown honestly sounds ideal.  #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Thank you for that!!! - Time for a quick walk then.  #stayathome #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	That representative from Texas said almost the same crap in his mind, refused to wear a mask when asked...Guess what, God doesn’t appreciate that crap...he’s now dealing with Covid-19 wherever he is. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	That’s because you’re a Karen and a trump lover. If you really cared for the people that deserve to live on this planet. You would wear a damn mask. Good luck for when you might need a ventilator soon. Us Normal people are going to wear masks to survive. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200803	1	The Whitehouse Cowboy is a slow learner, but even he realises that masks slow the spread of Covid. I’d rather listen to medical specialists- WHO, CDC than the quack Immanuel spouting about dream sex with demons causing Covid. Viruses don’t have a political agenda? #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	The most interesting thing is how the ones who’ve hollered about the masks being unnecessary and that the virus isn’t real are the ones now getting coronavirus. Know who aren’t getting it? Most people who’ve been wearing masks the whole time. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	The people who say wearing a mask is "living in fear" are the same people who are afraid of sharing a public restroom with a transgender person. #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	The protesters in my town wear masks, just like everyone else that can't social distance. Masks work. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Then leave the shop immediately and go somewhere else.The public health advice is to use your common sense, if a place is crowded or feels unsafe, leave. Just imagine being in a classroom with 25 teenagers and no masks,  that what our government wants in 4 weeks. #MasksSaveLives
20200803	1	There are rules & protocols in place for a reason. I am grateful for the scientists, doctors & other experts that are way smarter than me making these calls to stop the spread. I am happy to wear a mask if there’s any chance it will protect others. It’s that simple #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	They just closed my towns city hall indefinitely because an employee tested positive.  Adults can't figure out masks and social distancing.  But sure lets cram kids into buses and classrooms. #TrumpVirus2020 #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	This is ridiculous. I’m all for religion, just safe from my couch. As a San Diego women who got covid from a restaurant in Carlsbad. (Negative now). Wear a damn mask people, I almost died from this crap! #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	This pandemic, like any crisis, seems to squeeze the best and the worst of us out of the shadows. And he probably preaches about What Would Jesus Do. I’ll bet he’d wear a f**king mask.#COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Victoria is again in lockdown due to the poor policies implemented by the State Govt for hotel quarantine handled by poorly trained security guards, ppl did not obey social distancing nor stay home to await test results. Masks are now MANDATORY. #auspol #Covid19 #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Wearing masks during the pandemic is obviously a necessity, and those that aren't are just selfish or moronic. I wear a neck gaiter mask and it doesn't bother me at all, in fact it makes me feel better (probably due to my anxiety) - Am I alone in feeling that way? #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	What happens when we win the election and President Biden enacts a national mask mandate?  "Karens" will be coming out of the woodwork and it aint gonna be pretty.   How can we make this happen NOW?   #YesWeCanAgain #Biden2020Landslide #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	What's with the no mask thing? Do you really think life saving health laws are unconstitutional? Are you saying its okay for waiters to not wash their hands before handling your food? Get with it folks! Just WEAR THE DAMN MASK #Masks #MasksSaveLives
20200803	1	Where I live if you serve someone without a mask the business can be fined $9000 for each occurrence. So your $7 coffee & donut do not compensate the business for the risk of that loss. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Why not “Mask-Up Idaho” I was out there for the weekend and it was absolutely disgusting. I only saw 2 employees and maybe, MAYBE 20 people protecting those around them. #maskupidaho #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	YES, AGREE with above and also..... The UNITED STATES CITIZENS Deserve and Demanded testing so that they would know if they were sick to that could get treatment and PROTECT their loved ones and ALL AMERICANS. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Yesterday, a woman I passed in an enclosed area was wearing a mask with 45*’s name on the front. As much as I wanted to be irritated (knee jerk reaction nowadays), I secretly applauded her for putting common sense and safety first over politics (sort of). #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	You contracted it with the mask on, because other people aren’t wearing one. Your mask protects them from you. Masks only work if EVERYONE wears one! #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	An wear masks!!!!!!! #MasksSaveLives
20200804	1	And evidently today according to our "leader", there is a decline. Lies, lies, lies. No testing over weekend so of course the numbers are down. I don't need a math degree to figure that out. But #DeathSantis got pat on back for job well done #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	At this point I will happily take a couple of months of martial law just so that at the end of it I can get back to my fucking life! WEAR YOUR MASK PEOPLE AND PUT IT OVER YOUR GOD DAMN NOSE! I hate this fucking city #Nashville #COVIDIOT #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Covid-19 cases rise so highly meanwhile the people awareness of Covid-19 has been rapidly going down at the low level. Whenever I went outside, I saw most people didn't wear mask. That also indicate how people stupidity is rapidly going up at the high level #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV & only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Don't recommend going to Bottles and Stuff on Newburgh and 5 Mile. They're not enforcing/following the mask ordinance.  #Maskholes #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Every breath he exhales potentially spreads #COVID19. Why can't people be more considerate of people at risk? Answer...never go to Home Depot or use Sunrun products. Just say NO. Your company has failed to keep people safe. #SunRun #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	I don't get why there r folks so against #Masks? China manage to eliminate #COVID19 bc of its strict on masks and isolation. Continue mask-free and going out when issued with stay home notices. And your city/state can nvr end #COVID 1/2 #MasksDontWork #MasksSaveLives
20200804	1	I just saw a tweet that said something like “I don’t want to wear a mask cause then it’ll be normalized.”   If you don’t wear a mask NOW, it WILL become normalized and become part of every day life even after this. So wear it now, so we don’t have to later. #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	I'm so sorry for your loss, prayers and condolences go out to you & your family I lost my cousin to covid-19 day before yesterday, so I understand. People are dying as result of other people not wearing a mask. This is not a joke/hoax!!!! #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	Im still waiting to hear a real and truthful example of anyone who’s “medically exempt” from wearing a mask. Like prove me wrong but if ya have a heath condition surely getting the virus is hella worse than being a bit uncomfortable no? #WearAMaskPlease
20200804	1	It just occurred to me that since we will still be wearing face masks in the winter my nose will actually be warm. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	It needs to stop. If this is a thing you believe, it's YOU that's currently causing the most harm. Shut the fuck up, sit down, wear a mask and stop spreading your moist bullshit. I don't want to die because you're a fucking idiot.   #COVID19AB #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	It's mind boggling to me the number of people that still aren't wearing masks/wearing masks correctly. Georgia is nowhere close to flattening the curve. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	Just went to the gas station. The only person other than me wearing a mask was the cashier who was actually in a booth behind glass. I don't get it. The indifference is startling here. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Let’s agree that if you choose NOT to wear a mask in general public settings, then you forfeit any health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage and medical services by the front line workers the moment you COVID positive. Sign here.. #publichealth #COVID19 #insurance #NoMasks
20200804	1	Let’s get something straight: no one is comfortable wearing a mask. I don’t wake up every morning excited to cover my face, but I do it anyways b/c it’s the right thing to do for myself and those around me. Just get with it already....#COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Many people, including a massive number of idiots in Yakima County did not (and many still don’t) wear masks when advised and then mandated. Many others are only doing it halfway...as in not covering nose and mouth. Bottom line: #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Masks in public places are a necessary prevention tool. You DON'T need to have symptoms to be infected. Many people get Covid and never experience symptoms- They're known as silent Carriers, who are indeed, Spreading the virus.#WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Masks look to be part of our lives for some time to come, so it's more economical (and eco-friendly) to buy one or two cloth masks that you can wash and wear again. They're widely available (look online) and come in a huge range of patterns and colours. #WearAMaskPlease
20200804	1	No need to be patient. Not wearing a mask in public (as mandated by PA Governor) is the equivalent of swinging around a gun with the safety off; somebody’s going to get hurt. That said, I see Philadelphia P/O watch people walk around w/o masks and they say nada! #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Not only did everyone in the church wear a mask ALL THREE PRESIDENTS in attendance wore masks too #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	Over 155,000 Americans have succumbed to Covid-19 and too many more will.  Your right to not wear a mask is disrespectful to all front line workers and your fellow citizens.   Your right to not wear a mask contributes to our country’s horrific toll.  #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	TL/DR:  1. Consistent & correct wearing of masks 2. Avoid crowds & keep a distance of 6+ ft  3. Stay away from crowded places 4. Be outdoors rather than indoors 5. Wash your hands. Use sanitizer if you can't wash. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	Yes... right! @Adrieliam is judging and shaming people who don't wear masks because it endangers his health. Exactly! Now Ms Karen Larp... Was that so hard?  Go reward yourself with some cake! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	You know the whole point of a mask mandate is to WEAR the mask? NOT put it on your ear and let it hang or leave it by your water bottle or not wear it at all. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	You see it's because of populistic morons like yourself that we have trouble getting this virus under control!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	Your "logic" is typical of the uneducated. Just because THEY didn't die doesn't mean other people won't or won't have life long effects. You really are willing to sacrifice them #COVIDIOTS You probably don't even get the flu shot. Bunch of nutcases you all are #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Your running won’t affect my weight. Your mask wearing will affect my health. If you haven’t figured that out, you’re an idiot. If you have figured it out, you’re incredibly selfish. I run to protect my health. I wear a mask to protect others. Get over yourself. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Y’all, wearing a mask is great. I can mouth the words to the weird song I have in my head and no one looks at me funny. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	and yet @DrBonnieHenry @CDCofBC still not a fan of requiring masks. It doesn't make sense. Even Trump and Pence have been wearing and promoting them and that's the bottom of the intellectual barrel! #MasksSaveLives
20200804	1	noah fence but if i can wear a mask outside for 4 and 1/2 hours in the morning then 3 hours during the afternoon in the southern heat for band camp then u can wear a mask to the store <3  #WearAMaskPlease
20200804	1	— frickin’ idea what they’re talking about and how people like her are part of the problem. Sure, masks aren’t the cure for #COVID19 . But it certainly helps in being a preventative from the spread of the virus. So, again, #WearAMaskPlease. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200820	0	The homeless are always gathered together and they don't wear mask and they are not sick or spreading the virus.  Will someone explain to me how this is happening?  #NoMasks
20200820	0	The point of face masks is not to protect people, but to diminish humanity...slowly strip people of their human nature and individuality.  #NoMasks #masktyranny #MasksOff
20200820	0	The tinpot dictator will use any means to destroy our freedom forever, including locking us up at Christmas. The fun times are gone, the misery of the mask muppets and mannequins goes on forever, end this now. #NoMask
20200820	0	There's definitely one thing I know about these masks that they ask us to wear. I'm surrounded by smoke everywhere and I can taste it through my face covering. That tells me right there that wearing the damn things don't work. Even with smoke. Fear-mongering. #MasksOffAmerica
20200820	0	There’s no mask debate period- my town doesn’t and won’t wear face coverings! #MasksOffAmerica
20200820	0	This man has a massive personal vested interest in a vaccine being introduced and being compulsory. NO ONE WITH THIS MUCH CONFLICT OF INTEREST SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE. he’s also not a doctor. And masks have been shown to make things worse not better. #nomasks
20200820	0	Totally support y’all’s message. Keep up the good fight. #OpenAmerica #NoMasks
20200820	0	We have lost our humanity and freedoms to fascists and clipboard warriors, now we are not allowed to laugh, smile, kiss or hug in case we get Corona. I ignore all that shit because it's wrong and a hoax to destroy our lives. Fight back or cower behind the sofa at home. #NoMasks
20200820	0	Whoa my, #Candida We could make it together The further from here, girl, the better Where the air is fresh and clean. #masksoff #MasksOffAmerica
20200820	0	With a current 0.001% infection rate, it’s a safe call to say that mask mandates should be abolished. The same rates before and during the mask mandates. Deaths continue to drop to dismal numbers. @ottawahealth @JimWatsonOttawa @fordnation #NoMasks
20200820	0	Yep. I've seen already two ads using masks, even on kids! Walmart and Old Navy. Shame.  #nomasks
20200821	0	Amen.  Time to stand up and take off the masks! #NoMasks
20200821	0	I took my dogs to get groomed at PetCo. When I picked them up I wasn’t wear a mask. 2 teenaged girls wanted to pet my babies then screamed “MASK MASK MASK”. So I returned the favor with “ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK”. They won’t do that again!! #dogsoftwitter #MasksOff
20200821	0	I wonder if they social distance us when they try and cart us off to the quarantine camps or if they promise a free shower when we arrive so we don't need it #arrestHancock #NoMasks
20200821	0	Learning a lot about economics during this #Covid_19 mess  apparently Uk tourists spend £45 Billion in other countries every year  I wondered why they were jumping up and down like spoilt kids when they were added to the Quarantine list  #NoMasks
20200821	0	Masks aren't safe. #MasksOff #MasksOffAmerica
20200821	0	No shit. And masks are ineffective too. #Fauci knows it. #NoMasks
20200821	0	So if someone has a medical reason not to wear a mask you don’t care if they jeopardize their health? #masksdontwork
20200821	0	The #Masks are nothing but a #GlobalistsGagTool! It actually harms the wearer far more than supposedly protecting those around you. #MasksOffAmerica #masksdontwork
20200821	0	They look like they are living quite freely, while Americans are living under communist rule apparently.  #EndTheLockdown #openourschools #MasksOffAmerica
