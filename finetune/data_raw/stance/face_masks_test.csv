20200627	1	If you have enough $$ to buy a non-essential gadget from Best Buy, you have enough to buy a mask!! (V rough estimate but I’d say ~60% of customers at Best Buy @ eaton centre were not wearing a mask ) #COVID19 #masks
20200711	0	As a Trump supporter, this doesn’t make me feel any better about @GovWhitmer ‘s unconstitutional mask mandate. And, while I agree with what your mask says on it, I disagree wholeheartedly with wearing one. Period.   #StandUpMichigan #NoMasks

20200713	1	I just had my oxygen checked at the doctor’s office (with a mask on) and my oxygen was at 99.   So yeah. #WearAMask
20200713	1	Just had a visit with my dentist—staggered appts, masks, wiping down high touch surfaces, face shield + appropriate PPE, sx screen before and at visit along with temp check. The best you can do and they did a fab job. Dr John Wiggans in Hillcrest Plaza, Dallas. #BeSafe #WearAMask
20200713	1	Masks help to reduce viral load. You still might get Covid but you won’t get severely sick. Countries (eg:  ,  etc) with mandatory mask wearing report new cases but look at their number of deaths-very low. If we’re smart, we won’t need lockdowns. #WearAMask

20200713	2	Thank you, Dr. Gunter. Also @SuzanneEvans1 haircuts are neither inevitable nor inevitably long. Haircuts are a choice. #WearAMask

20200714	1	I have been wondering what is the right approach. By saying nothing you are in turn approving a behavior. I was @Costco and a mom w/ a child and husband (both w/ masks on) wasn't wearing one. I politely said they have them for free when you come in. She was not amused #WearAMask
20200714	1	No. You’re missing the point. And from the way I phrased my statement I can understand why. I was attempting to point out masks work! They help stop the spread of disease. I should have stated it more clearly. I’m a scientist & a big fan of masks- and science!!  #WearAMask

20200727	0	Just back from the High St. Refused to wear a mask. Turned away from shops, as were many others. People walking around like dehumanised zombies.  Just as the High St was getting back, this nonsensical mandatory mask policy will finish it off.  #NoMasks #NoMaskOnMe

20200802	1	For anyone claiming that fear is the killer and not covid: fear is an incentive for self preservation. Fear for others creates responsibility. It doesn’t have to be negative. It also helps you be a mask wearing informed human.  So yes I am afraid.   #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I flew a few days ago. It was made crystal clear masks are be worn AT ALL TIMES in airport and on plane. Before we boarded @SouthwestAir nicely announced 'don't even think about not complying or you won't be flying'. To have the privelage to fly we must comply. #MasksSaveLives
20200802	1	Maybe get a washable, reusable mask. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200802	2	Keep him home. No in person school until there's a vaccine. Schools won't let kids attend without vaccinations. Why is this any different? Covid19 can be a lifelong Illness awa deadly Unless you want to risk your families health and lives, keep your children home. #WearADamnMask

20200803	1	A virus is much smaller than shown.  How-ev-er, a virus needs water to survive. The virus rides on airbourne water mist from a cough. Each drop is about 150 to 800 microns.   It would not pass through the mesh of the mask, no matter how dense your intelligence.  #WearADamnMask
