20200331	1	I’ve been wondering why almost every photo taken around the world shows everyday people wearing masks... Not in the United States. #trump #coronavirus #masks
20200331	1	Why doesn't Pillow Man make MASKS if he wants to be helpful?  #mypillowguy #coronavirusUSA #masks
20200617	1	It disturbs me that with everything going on with #covid19 cases sharply rising that #repairmen are not automatically wearing masks! Even when they come into your home. Even the cashier at the #mechanics. This needs to be addressed! #Raleigh #Cary @RoyCooperNC #wakecounty #masks
20200625	1	I did...  And it was at least 107° in #Tucson today   - so anyone outside the southwest can kiss my a** if they aren't wearing a mask "because it is too hot"  #WearAMask #Arizona #coronavirus #masks
20200625	1	Starting today, people in Marion and Polk counties will be required to wear a face mask when they are in public, indoor spaces. This mandate comes in an attempt to prevent the spread of #COVID19. #Coronavirus #oregon #salemoregon #OR #SalemOR #clypiancoverage #masks

20200626	0	It’s a felony if you wear a mask while carrying a concealed weapon.   Is that the real reason they want us to wear masks? So they know who to attack.   #masks
20200626	1	Today I realized if the solution to climate change was for everyone to just wear a mask, we would still fail. #ClimateCrisis #freedom #masks

20200627	1	Thank you. I'm nowhere near you to come inlater, but appreciate yr efforts! I'm not front line acute (community hospital) but still had patients test +ve. Ppl are naive. Still threat. Easy transmission, horrible disease. Long term effects. V much not over. #2metres #masks
20200627	1	The difference between anti seatbelt & anti mask people is that the latter is leaving a digital footprint of their ignorance for their grandkids.  #masks
20200627	1	We cannot afford another economic shutdown. We cannot put those vulnerable at further risk than we can reasonably mitigate. The simple, inexpensive, and mostly effective solution that can curb the virus spread is wearing a mask in public. Stay open and help the vulnerable. #masks
20200628	1	@Walmart start protecting your employees and customers and start regulating and mandating masks. I probably have it already as well as 8 other associates in my neighborhood market.  Please at least pretend you care.  They actually help. #masks
20200628	1	@realDonaldTrump you should make MAGA masks. Put them on and encourage your supporters to do the same!  #DonaldTrump #maga #masks

20200711	0	Even though I wear a hearing aid my hearing loss is such that I rely on lip reading- if masks become mandatory people like me will be forced into a life of isolation whilst trying to live day to day, it won’t be worth going out.#NoMask
20200711	0	I’m with you on that. I though Boris was a level headed politician, I’m starting to question that.  If you’re more comfortable wearing a mask for protection, then fien, wear one, but don’t force me to wear one too.  Masks only work if the person wearing it is ill.  #MasksOff
20200711	0	Masks are as well hiding our facial features which otherwise make us recognizable. By making compulsory to wear them along with the social distancing, are they trying to dehumanise and disconnect us? #MaskeyeHayır #NoToMasks #NoMasks
20200711	0	Rex, you do understand there is no medical evidence masks work, right? Not defending the behavior of these 2 dipshits, but wearing a mask does nothing. #masksdontwork

20200712	0	Meanwhile those who have fallen prey to the panic and hysteria are pushing for a national requirement to wear masks. THAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN #NoMasks
20200712	0	Most people I have seen in Ohio don't wear masks. Most People in Ohio can see through this covid 19 "pandemic" hoax. They are not falling for the main stream medias deception. Nice try. Try again. #MasksOnOhio #COVID19 #MasksOffAmerica
20200712	0	My 18 year old daughter proved today why masks don’t work and shouldn’t be encouraged or mandated ! She wore it on her head like a headband , wore it on her eyes, flung it across the room, and then I caught her chewing on it!! #NoMasks

20200712	0	Well folks, that weirdo #NealCavuto can skip his Viagra tonight. He finally got to see @POTUS wear a mask. The way the media reacts to this proves it’s so much more symbolic than health related. There are some crazy ass lunatics out there. #MasksOffAmerica
20200712	0	Went shopping today w/o a mask.  Clerk was probably forced to have one but, kept pulling it down to come close and talk to me so we could actually communicate.  When they backed away for "social distancing" they pulled their mask back up.  Felt bad for him.  #masksdontwork
20200712	0	Why would you wear a mask? You’re not sick. Only sick ppl should be wearing masks.   Knock it off-you look ridiculous!!!   #NoMasks

20200712	1	It shouldn't be a news headline that Trump has a mask on during a pandemic. It should have been a bigger headline when he had rallies and meetings without a.mask. #coronavirus #NoMask
20200712	1	It’s a sad day, that the main news is Trump wears a mask! #MasksOn #NoMasks
20200712	1	Yep masks only worn in the O.R. and infection contagion risk areas of high risk patients. And they were not these cheap ass blue and white paper masks they were N95 respirator masks.  #SayNoToMasks
20200712	2	Me neither. #SayNoToMasks
20200712	2	New title Maskhole. I think I'm going to use this very soon. #coronavirus #NoMasks
20200712	2	No shutdowns. Already a mask mandate in most county and local cities. You need to do as McDucey stated in the press conference - Stay Home, Stay Safe, Watch Netflix...or eat outside if you go dining out.   #OpenArizona #FakePandemic #masksdontwork
20200712	2	They need mail in voting. In order to accomplish that they need to instill fear and keep schools and universities closed. #masksdontwork

20200713	0	I got yelled yesterday by some male version of Karen for not wearing mask at the vegetable store . Poor soul was triggered by it and probably had his vagina inflamed for seeing me without mask.    #MasksOffAmerica
20200713	0	I wore one yesterday because I felt scared by mask zombies  tutting and sniping  at me  when I  didn't wear one the day before.  On medical grounds,  I'm exempt  anyway . I'm NEVER  repeating yesterday's  experience again and will not wear a mask again.   #NoMasks

20200713	0	Ok, I’ve just gotta say it...MASKS SHOULD NOT BE FASHION STATEMENTS! If you want to wear one, that’s fine w/me but the thought that people are making & buying pattered masks is actually terrifying. Wake up and think! Wake up and fight!!! #saynotomasks #MasksOffAmerica #NoMasks
20200713	0	SERIOUS QUESTION ~ If you had ONLY 7 days LEFT to LIVE your LIFE, would you STILL WEAR a MASK and AVOID your family and friends? Would you CONTINUE to STAND 6ft. apart from everyone? Would you NOT GIVE ANYONE a HUG? #NoMasks
20200713	0	Someone needs to do a study on how many ardent mask-wears got COVID-19 since we all know (including the government) that masks don’t work. #MasksOffAmerica

20200713	1	3. In many countries these are being handed free out at metros, supermarkets, town halls and doctor's surgeries. Home made ones don't usually clip over the nose so are pretty useless. Why is England so arrogant that it won't learn from other countries? #WearAMask

20200713	1	All the more recent evidence points to their effectiveness but you're quite right the precautionary principle demanded they be used. #Masks4All
20200713	1	Also, I bought a new *reusable* mask in @SuperValuIRL for a fiver and I'm BUZZING to add it to my collection. why'd I buy it? Well because 1. I cannot sew and 2. I can't be asking my auntie to make me more masks but 3. I WANT ALL THE MASKS #WearAMask
20200713	1	Awesome @DoroLef ! Great to see so many caring people around the world ! #MaskWearersAroundtheworld #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
20200713	1	But far fewer, as they tend to adhere to the droplets of moisture in your breath and these get trapped in your mask.  You DO realise the point of a mask is to protect others rather than yourself, don't you?  #WearAMask

20200713	1	Hey Republicans and other #trumpanzees If you do as that orange fool in the WH tells you about #Covid_19 you will die. You are letting that fool lead you to an early grave. Now, if that’s ok with you, then go right ahead. But you dummies won’t take me with you. #WearAMask
20200713	1	Hey so, something weird happened when I went to get my mums medication, some guy honked his car horn at me and gave me a thumbs up, was it because I was wearing a mask? #Covid_19 #WearAMask
20200713	1	How did we get to the greatest public health failure of our time?  Months ago Americans were asked to wear a mask to save a life.  Not enlist, not run into a burning building, simply wear a mask.  And America said "No".    #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200713	1	I guess I should’ve know any effort to flatten the curve that depended on an overwhelming majority of Americans to refrain from being self-centered was doomed to fail. #WearAMask
20200713	1	I hung a "Help Us Stay Open, Please wear a mask in our shop" sign on our door this morning.  Mom & Pop shops don't have sick days.  We don't have employees.  Cases in our county are rising fast (thank you, evangelical revival & church camp attendees).  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200713	1	I know everyone’s freaked about American tourists coming to Ireland but I was shopping in dunnes earlier & half the shop weren’t wearing masks  can we at least try to get it right ourselves, please #WearAMask

20200713	1	I try to be unbiased on my Twitter.  Which is why I’m saying Wear A Mask.  Because wearing a mask isn’t political or partisan. It’s common sense and kind to your fellow human.  We all have to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.  #WearAMask
20200713	1	I was at @ShopprsDrugMart yesterday and the lady behind me was refused entry for not having a mask, it was great! #WearAMask
20200713	1	I wonder if we said new evidence supported #COVID19 was an attack on the world from socialist space aliens, would we see more people start wearing masks? #boringIndependenceDay #WelcometoEarth #WearADamnMask #WearAMask
20200713	1	I work 10 hours in a 96 degree wearhouse walking 20,000+ steps a day and lifting heavy boxes and I wear a mask. STOP COMPLAINING YOU CANT BREATH WELL ENOUGH TO WALK 30 MiN WITH A MASK. #WearAMask
20200713	1	If you haven’t been wearing a mask in #SanDiego yet, the air from the #Navyfire leaves you no choice now. Quality right now is very mixed. The smell is definitely potent and it can’t be good to take in and mess up the respiratory system now. #StayHome #WearAMask
20200713	1	If you think wearing a mask makes you look stupid, when's the last time you looked in the mirror? #WearAMask
20200713	1	Just try test driving what you think your Constitutional rights are... you’ll get kicked out of Bass Pro Shop...and anywhere else you try to shop without a mask.  You do not have the right to put other people’s health in danger.  #WearAMask
20200713	1	Lets just remember that its not the policy around face masks which will ruin the high streets   Its the opinions and views of those who are ignorant and entitled which will damange high streets.   Just get on with it and stop moaning #facemasks #WearAMask

20200713	1	People who like to sew: a fat quarter of fabric is the perfect size to make two pleated masks :) cut it in half then in half again and double up two squares to make one mask. Make pleats By making 3-4 folds, sew the edges, and add ties. Done. #normalisemaskwearing #WearAMask

20200713	1	Truly can see "ignorance is bliss," when a Florida woman says I shouldn't wear a mask and to not fear the virus because she doesn't. I don't fear getting the virus but have respect for others and refuse encourage this ignorance. #WearAMask
20200713	1	Trumps cronies are now making it known that there is no negative to wearing a mask.. @realDonaldTrump finally wears a mask..its a shame its 3 months too late. You have already killed or permantly damanged half of of America ( physically, financially and mentally) #WearAMask

20200713	1	Wearing your mask below your nose is like using a condom with the tip cut off. Absolutely Worthless. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200713	1	Welp considering the it’s the States who are being travel banned right now and more people have died then in wars, maybe it’s not a hoax?  Ps had Trump taken Covid seriously, economy probably wouln’t have crashed like it did  #consequences #WearAMask
20200713	1	What’s Schantz.   The Democrat Governors of WA and NY have both done a great job combatting #COVID19..  The Democrat mayor of NYC is a damn idiot tho.  Don’t be a #COVIDIOT, Kris.  #WearAMask

20200713	2	It seems that some people can't think beyond themselves and their needs. They will also be the people who complain if there is another lockdown, effectively caused by their lack of compliance. #WearAMask

20200713	2	The experts and media portrayed Sars-cov-2 as a supernatural virus which you couldn't create immunity to, you could get a second time, would never go away (as all corona viruses do), etc. Temp check is what is done when I go for facial. Makes tons of sense. #NoMasks

20200713	2	Well, if you're @GovRonDeSantis, you can just stop reporting the dead, leading your constituents to a false sense of security and certain death. If you're @Potus, you can stop testing, deluding your followers into believing that, yes, it's all a hoax. #WearAMask

20200727	0	I really think that not wearing a mask empowers others to do the same.   I think it is particular to time of day/place too. On eve  train tonight, far fewer people had them on &  I was in a poorer area too. Has anyone else noticed any trends with mask compliance? #kbf #nomasks

20200727	0	People listen. Let’s talk a little truth here. Do an experiment. Put on your mask and walk into a room with a scent, candles, freshener, perfume. Covid virus is smaller than that. If you can smell a scent the virus has no problem getting in. #masksdontwork

20200727	0	So let me get this straight: you have to wear a mask or everyone will die unless you’re sitting and eating or protesting, which makes the virus safe? Also, mask= safe, shirt over face=everyone dies? It’s not just that the rules are wrong, they’re arbitrary. #nomasks

20200730	0	Sheeple are so focused on the sins of the past they don’t see what’s happening. Modern day slavery should be the issue cause it exists. Through sex trafficking, child trafficking & now MASKS. Masks hurt more than help. They are just a sign of submission.  #MasksOff
20200730	0	That is what most elders look like in their n-95 masks. Turns out, if you are older & have breathing issues anyway, including physical restrictions like weight, it can make the mask deadly. If he leaves it on longer he could die. #oxygen #nomasks
20200730	0	The TRUTH @ottawahealth is hiding from you:    Once the temperature reaches above 74F degrees 23.3C the virus CANNOT survive!.  Why the masks?  (mind control) Why the increase in numbers? (more mind control) Why distancing? (mind control)  Awake now? #OttawaMaskContest #NoMasks

20200730	0	Yeah, I had to wear a %^$& mask to go to the eye doctor today. I ended up getting light-headed with a major migraine. I don't go anywhere else that requires  a #mask. #NoMaskOnMe

20200731	0	Exactly. And I've not worn a mask at all, been in huge crowds without masks, been at a house party close quarters with someone who 2 days later tested positive and I still haven't caught it.  So the mask debate rages on... #NoMasks

20200731	0	Masks are being proven for the rise in COVID-19, places which are now experiencing rising figures generally have mandatory masks. People are touching faces and are helping spread Coronavirus. The UK’s figures are rising, due to this very reason. #hancockmustgo #kbf #NoMasks
20200731	0	Masks mandated. Cases suddenly rise. Coincidence? #NoMasks
20200731	0	Media claim the UK had the most excess deaths during lockdown. Firstly, I'm not sure if this is true. Secondly, it's implied the excess deaths are due to Covid19. When in reality they are probably due to the NHS closing its doors to everything over than Covid! #COVID19 #NoMask
20200731	0	STOP  wearing mask !! There is no standard, even medical grade will not stop viruses. They are mean to produce fear and submission to government rule. If we all stand up they will loose control. #NoMaskOnMe

20200801	0	Here we go again now #Tarrantcounty went and got stupid and extended there sheep call = (mask mandate)for another month.  Their justification is #GovAbbott hasn't discharged his fake executive order that governor don't have. And it not a law. #NoVoteNoLaw #MyBodyMyChoice #NoMask

20200801	0	I'm sorry this link is essentially an opinion piece. Read the paper it links to & read the caveats, the paper leans towards high grade masks being useful in medical situations, it adds nothing & provides no evidence for the use of face coverings in public. #KBF #NoMasks

20200801	0	Next time someone tells you to wear a mask, just respond with a confident "No." It's working. Stores are already realizing they can't enforce this. Politicians may not give up, but we can make their mask orders irrelevant. #NoMasks   Post your refusal story at #SayNoToMasks

20200802	0	Think @DrChrisSmith just blew away the whole #facemask argument by stating it's based on "slim evidence". So @SadiqKhan and @BorisJohnson has made this draconian law on flawed medical proof. #NoMask
20200802	0	Yeah.... Actually no, the guidance has been a joke & the why has been for corporate money making. Am over 50, v healthy, don't wear a mask (ever) or social distance (oxymoron). Won't have a vaccine, nor will I shield for a disease that's virtually gone in the UK. #KBF #NoMasks
20200802	0	Your argument; anyone who disagrees doesn't have a voice, hmm nicely fascist. If lockdown is the 'only' reason, why was one not needed for previous pandemics? So to stop numbers going up, we need to lockdown forever? Strange how a simpleton can fault your logic. #KBF #NoMasks
20200802	1	#facemasks are mostly effective when wore by the sick people. As it is difficult to know who is sick and who is not, if mass people #WearAMask in public places it can significantly reduce the spread of the virus. #WearAMaskPlease

20200802	1	A guy with no mask just knocked on my door. I have big loud dogs, he backed away. I stuck my head out and he yelled across the yard. He's selling frozen beef. Holy hell, he came to my door with no mask. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	A question to the people wearing their masks on their chins...do you think it’s doing anything  #CoverYourFace
20200802	1	Agreed nothing is perfect, but don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Bottom line, if we all wear our masks we are all significantly less likely to get sick.  Do your part and #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Am I ever going to learn that my phone doesn’t recognize me when I have my mask on? But still...#WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Another question...do the people wearing the masks below their nose know it is also connected to their lungs? #CoverYourFace
20200802	1	As of 38 minutes ago, my 3 kids and I entered day 150 of lockdown. That's 150 days that I haven't seen any of my family, friends or another adult because I'm trying to keep my #immunocompromised son safe. It makes me angry that so many people won't even wear a mask.#WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Because a lot of people STILL refuse to wear masks, and stay physically distant from others, I'm gearing up for some GREAT holidays, such as:  Hallowzoom Zoomsgiving Christzoom Zoom Year's Eve Zoomukkah Kwanzoom  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Bullshit. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Daily reminder: every time you see a person without a mask outside, remember: they're the reason this pandemic STILL isn't over yet...  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Dr Nick, I agree it’s brilliant...but I’m disappointed that so many comments here show that either people lack a sense of humour!  and/or don’t get how essential both vaccinations and mask wearing are for our survival! Shocking!  #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives #MasksOn
20200802	1	Face masks are a lot like condoms. Nobody WANTS to wear em but, you should be wearing them to keep yourself and others safe. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Finally went out after dialing it WAY back after the shutdowns.  I’m very happy to report everyone in sight is wearing a mask, socially distancing and not a single Karen/Kevin. Still a little gun shy about being out, but I am encouraged.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	For those who say #COVID19  isn't any worse than the flu, I give you MATH (but you can't really compare these 2)  2018-19 US flu season deaths were 34,200 (@CDCgov)  % increase using US CV19 deaths (157,396 SO FAR)   = 360% increase. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY PERCENT! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Go @Delta  These stories are too frequent! Mandatory mask requirement AND every airline needs to make it clear to every single passenger there WILL be prosecution with minimum of a $10,000 fine if there’s an incident regarding #Mask. Ppl need to comply w/ rules! #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	He's an expert, you're a failed tv host/failed businessman (who bankrupted a casino!) so I'll go with Dr. Fauci.  The US has more cases due to your FAILURE to act, FAILURE to lead #TrumpVirus #ImPOTUS #TrumpGolfsYouDie #PutinsPuppet #PutinsGOP #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	Here’s the thing, I support responsible gun owner rights but if you own one for protection in case someone tries to hurt you but you won’t wear a mask, isn’t that a bit ironic? Neither one 100% guarantees your survival but it could possibly help, right? #WearAMaskPlease

20200802	1	I assume all of the Sheriffs, who weren’t social distancing or wearing masks, had Covid tests the past two days to confirm multiple negative tests?   As a Republican, I know we can do better Mr. President.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I didn't know that wearing a mask and staying at home was mission impossible, like damn man. Ya'll had one job and managed to fuck it up. Smh #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I don’t need to read the article - it’s because they’re selfish and short sighted.  We’re in the middle of an out of control pandemic, what does wearing a mask hurt?!  #MaskItOrCasket #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	I don’t understand these people who will not wear a mask . Inconsiderate fools. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	I have cancer, I do not go out except for blood tests and chemo.  There are people in line at Quest with no mask, even though their sign says "no entry without a mask".  I would like to go out, shop, eat in a restaurant, but I am terrified. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I live in a state with a Democratic governor. Masks in public places have been mandatory since at least June 1.  I shopped in 3 different stores today. Everybody was masked, and I didn’t hear a single “but muh freedums.” #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I mean, I get it, a mask is uncomfortable, it fogs your glasses, it gets hot, it becomes a nuisance after wearing it for a long time; but gosh, it shouldn’t be politicized! For your heath’s sake & that of others, wear it! It may save your life. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	I see a lot of robust bellies, no masks, no life preservers. You can almost feel the covid that’s inevitable. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	I'm not condoning violence, but why are all the stories about people catching a beating over masks about people who actually comply? You would think the non-mask wearers would be the ones on the run. #MaskItOrCasket #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	If Anne Frank could live in a secret annex with seven other people for two years. I can wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	If a mask mandate could help save lives and violates the law, CHANGE! THE! LAW! NOT having the mandate could actually be helping kill people, do you really want that on your shoulders @GovRicketts? #youcandoit #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	If you're not willing to wear a mask at a grocery store (even when it's mandatory), could you at least utilize their delivery or pickup options (which is often free)? You are gaining nothing. Does the thrill of walking down the cereal really mean that much to you?  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO. #MaskMoaners
20200802	1	It is because some GOP Congress people are not wearing their masks!!!For same. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	It's you vs. the virus. The ONLY way to win is to stop it from spreading by depriving it of future hosts. That means staying the fuck home and wearing a damn mask if you MUST leave the house.  #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	It’s good to see a shift in consumer behavior re: masks when corporations (esp. those that serve non-compliant areas) enact rules. Virtually no masks ~1mo ago at my parent’s local @Walmart. Today? >70% compliance. (Both observations based on my experience.) #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	It’s incorrect but it if makes you feel better it’s simple: stay home as much as possible, wear a fabric mask when you do have to go out and get some surgical masks if you need to be out for extended periods of time.  You’re welcome #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	It’s time for people to act responsibly. There is enough evidence that masks work. Adults shouldn’t have to be told to wear a mask. It’s not a political statement it’s what makes us all safer. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200802	1	Let's be clear: it is all our business if you are not wearing a mask in our presence. This is not just about you. You don't have a right to kill those around you. If you harm someone for reminding you to wear a mask. You will be charged. Stop being selfish!! #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Look a #COVIDIOT #TrumpDeathCult member. #resist the #TrumpDeathCult they want to kill us all. @GavinNewsom @SupervisorCox @SupFletcher @ToddGloria we need protection from the virus and domestic terrorists like anti mask guy. #Gettested #StaySafeStayHome #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	Neil, stop being a snowflake and wear a mask. It won’t be forever, and it will help the most vulnerable to be protected against covid19. I wear one every day at work, it’s no big deal. #WearAMaskPlease
20200802	1	New York state has been wearing masks since early April. We now have very low case numbers. At one point over 300/ were dying. Now we are in the single digits. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	No mask? Careless, self-centered no concern for anyone else’s health. Don’t be like Joe #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	No, we have more cases because you said it was a hoax and no one wants to wear masks. Also teenagers are having large parties because they think they are invincible. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	No... You're not a "bad person" necessarily... you're just... obviously... tragically... not too smart. Too easily larped. This isn't D&D... a spell won't save you. Herman Cain didn't wear a mask, and now he's dead. Don't be like #HermanCain. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200802	1	Not true. Also, there is currently a vaccine for the flu. Why are you trying to minimize this pandemic? People are dying every minute in this country because the federal government is leaderless and has politicized the one thing that could mitigate it. #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Not wearing a mask is "small dick energy."  #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	On the bus. Out of the 6 people on the lower deck only 2 have their masks on properly 3 have their mouths covered but their nose poking out and one has it round their neck. Just what is the point? It’s really not that hard #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Or.... you can wear a mask when going out and near other people! #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	Over 148,000 Americans  have died. We are not showing them any respect or learning from the senseless deaths that could be avoided by wearing a mask. Obviously Washington County and other counties are failing as  #COVID19 # 's keep #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	So 9 out of 10 members of Congress with Covid-19 is a Republican. Doesn’t that antidotal added to science tell you something? Covid-19 doesn’t care about your politics but the politics of the Republican Party have made it worse. #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	The realization of how many think we're nvincible to #COVID19 was never more apparent until we saw people actually walk into the funeral home with no mask defying our state order. You're literally standing with the dead all around you and you still don't get it. #WearADamnMask

20200802	1	that's nonsense:  masks reduce the distance water droplets from your mouth spread, thereby lowering the likelihood of the virus spreading (the virus travels in water droplets) stop your whining, stop spreading misinformation and #WearADamnMask

20200802	2	Don’t blame the governor, it is 45’s lack of leadership that has lead to these problems. Deaths didn’t start going crazy until businesses started opening up early, under pressure of federal government.  #TrumpsDeathToll157K #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #extendthe600 #WearADamnMask

20200803	0	No I wouldn't. If this was the pandemic they predicted over 10million people world wide would have died. I'm sorry for the families who have list their loved ones, however wearing a mask in a normal flu season wouldn't stop it...would it? Peace  #KeepBritainFree #NoMasks

20200803	1	The most interesting thing is how the ones who’ve hollered about the masks being unnecessary and that the virus isn’t real are the ones now getting coronavirus. Know who aren’t getting it? Most people who’ve been wearing masks the whole time. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	The people who say wearing a mask is "living in fear" are the same people who are afraid of sharing a public restroom with a transgender person. #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	The protesters in my town wear masks, just like everyone else that can't social distance. Masks work. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Then leave the shop immediately and go somewhere else.The public health advice is to use your common sense, if a place is crowded or feels unsafe, leave. Just imagine being in a classroom with 25 teenagers and no masks,  that what our government wants in 4 weeks. #MasksSaveLives
20200803	1	There are rules & protocols in place for a reason. I am grateful for the scientists, doctors & other experts that are way smarter than me making these calls to stop the spread. I am happy to wear a mask if there’s any chance it will protect others. It’s that simple #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	They just closed my towns city hall indefinitely because an employee tested positive.  Adults can't figure out masks and social distancing.  But sure lets cram kids into buses and classrooms. #TrumpVirus2020 #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	This is ridiculous. I’m all for religion, just safe from my couch. As a San Diego women who got covid from a restaurant in Carlsbad. (Negative now). Wear a damn mask people, I almost died from this crap! #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	This pandemic, like any crisis, seems to squeeze the best and the worst of us out of the shadows. And he probably preaches about What Would Jesus Do. I’ll bet he’d wear a f**king mask.#COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Victoria is again in lockdown due to the poor policies implemented by the State Govt for hotel quarantine handled by poorly trained security guards, ppl did not obey social distancing nor stay home to await test results. Masks are now MANDATORY. #auspol #Covid19 #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Wearing masks during the pandemic is obviously a necessity, and those that aren't are just selfish or moronic. I wear a neck gaiter mask and it doesn't bother me at all, in fact it makes me feel better (probably due to my anxiety) - Am I alone in feeling that way? #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	What happens when we win the election and President Biden enacts a national mask mandate?  "Karens" will be coming out of the woodwork and it aint gonna be pretty.   How can we make this happen NOW?   #YesWeCanAgain #Biden2020Landslide #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	What's with the no mask thing? Do you really think life saving health laws are unconstitutional? Are you saying its okay for waiters to not wash their hands before handling your food? Get with it folks! Just WEAR THE DAMN MASK #Masks #MasksSaveLives
20200803	1	Where I live if you serve someone without a mask the business can be fined $9000 for each occurrence. So your $7 coffee & donut do not compensate the business for the risk of that loss. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Why not “Mask-Up Idaho” I was out there for the weekend and it was absolutely disgusting. I only saw 2 employees and maybe, MAYBE 20 people protecting those around them. #maskupidaho #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	YES, AGREE with above and also..... The UNITED STATES CITIZENS Deserve and Demanded testing so that they would know if they were sick to that could get treatment and PROTECT their loved ones and ALL AMERICANS. #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	Yesterday, a woman I passed in an enclosed area was wearing a mask with 45*’s name on the front. As much as I wanted to be irritated (knee jerk reaction nowadays), I secretly applauded her for putting common sense and safety first over politics (sort of). #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	You contracted it with the mask on, because other people aren’t wearing one. Your mask protects them from you. Masks only work if EVERYONE wears one! #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	You know whats more uncomfortable than a mask? A tube on your fucking gut. #WearTheDamnMask #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	anyone who doesn't comply with face coverings ect deserve to catch covid and end on a ventilator and die #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200803	1	multi-generational households are traditionally POC & taking it home to their grandmas & parents is the feature not the bug w/ this “@WhiteHouse plan” for this [corona]virus.  #DeliberateSpreaders seems obvious it’s why we’re STILL arguing abt masks. #WearADamnMask

20200803	2	I heard that this weekend. I told them the death certificate can't lie. It may list they died WITH covid, but doesn't say they died OF covid. Not sure I got anywhere, but I tried. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask

20200804	0	Before the 24th I hadn't seen 1 mask or gloves on ANY supermarket staff for the last 3 months.  Same with police, even while scooping drunks off the street, they stopped wearing the masks months ago.  I've not heard of any 'cases' here up north. #NoMask

20200804	1	@StopandShop Hey there..“No Mask No Service” is not being enforced in your Hempstead trpk and Wantaugh ave location. Have to stare down folks with a chinstraps every turn I make. I care about my senior mother that I take food shopping! This is pitiful! #StopAndShop #NoMasks
20200804	1	@barnardfox5dc #gooddaydc  if you were worried about covid-19, you would have on a mask and not get in his face smh #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	Also I’m sure since you are refusing masks, you will refuse any vaccine that comes out. I would also appreciate it if you stay the “f” away from me, my family and friends #COVID19AB #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	And evidently today according to our "leader", there is a decline. Lies, lies, lies. No testing over weekend so of course the numbers are down. I don't need a math degree to figure that out. But #DeathSantis got pat on back for job well done #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	At this point I will happily take a couple of months of martial law just so that at the end of it I can get back to my fucking life! WEAR YOUR MASK PEOPLE AND PUT IT OVER YOUR GOD DAMN NOSE! I hate this fucking city #Nashville #COVIDIOT #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Covid-19 cases rise so highly meanwhile the people awareness of Covid-19 has been rapidly going down at the low level. Whenever I went outside, I saw most people didn't wear mask. That also indicate how people stupidity is rapidly going up at the high level #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	DO NOT REOPEN SCHOOLS!! #DoNotReopenSchools #ProtectStudents #KeepUsSafe #COVID19 #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV & only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Don't recommend going to Bottles and Stuff on Newburgh and 5 Mile. They're not enforcing/following the mask ordinance.  #Maskholes #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	Good for them! So tired of reading constant stories of those who refuse to abide by mask mandates. Equally tired of abuse workers are facing to try to enforce them.  #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Good morning! Wear a mask when not at home, keep a minimum distance of 6 feet as best you can, and wash your hands frequently throughout the day. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	He's so spot on. I'm so deeply sorry for the family.  My deepest condolences. No one is wearing a mask here in Georgia.  Gas station me and the guy behind the counter.  15 others no mask. #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	Hey folks, if you wear a mask I think: She has her reasons. So if I don't wear a mask, you think: She has her reasons.  It's called respect. If we're divided, we're all in trouble.  #MaskUp #NoMasks
20200804	1	How are these #COVIDIOTS still alive. They are crowded in a room with no masks. I’m shocked that the press are not wearing masks. Shameful! #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	I bet if we went around telling anti-maskers that there was a gay gene spreading through #Covid_19 they’d wear their masks. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	I don't get why there r folks so against #Masks? China manage to eliminate #COVID19 bc of its strict on masks and isolation. Continue mask-free and going out when issued with stay home notices. And your city/state can nvr end #COVID 1/2 #MasksDontWork #MasksSaveLives
20200804	1	I just saw a tweet that said something like “I don’t want to wear a mask cause then it’ll be normalized.”   If you don’t wear a mask NOW, it WILL become normalized and become part of every day life even after this. So wear it now, so we don’t have to later. #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	I would just like to say to the two young - I am not going to call them men because they don’t deserve it – boys who laughed and called me crazy when I put on a mask as they ran past me on the trail… Good luck boys. #parkcity #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	I'm so sorry for your loss, prayers and condolences go out to you & your family I lost my cousin to covid-19 day before yesterday, so I understand. People are dying as result of other people not wearing a mask. This is not a joke/hoax!!!! #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	If I hear one more man wine about their mask being too tight behind their ears, Ima lose my mind. No pantyhose have EVER been anything other than too tight E.V.E.R.Y.W.H.E.R.E #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	If YOU STUPID#MAGA MORONS had worn masks since March like the rest of us did, the #COVID19 virus would no longer be spreading EXPONENTIALLY (look it up) and our schools COULD REOPEN and economy would be well into recovery - like the REST of the WORLD!#WearADamnMask
20200804	1	If you can't get people to believe they need to wear a mask, how will you convince them they need to get a vaccine? Asking for a friend... #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	Im still waiting to hear a real and truthful example of anyone who’s “medically exempt” from wearing a mask. Like prove me wrong but if ya have a heath condition surely getting the virus is hella worse than being a bit uncomfortable no? #WearAMaskPlease
20200804	1	It just occurred to me that since we will still be wearing face masks in the winter my nose will actually be warm. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	It needs to stop. If this is a thing you believe, it's YOU that's currently causing the most harm. Shut the fuck up, sit down, wear a mask and stop spreading your moist bullshit. I don't want to die because you're a fucking idiot.   #COVID19AB #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	It's mind boggling to me the number of people that still aren't wearing masks/wearing masks correctly. Georgia is nowhere close to flattening the curve. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	Let’s agree that if you choose NOT to wear a mask in general public settings, then you forfeit any health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage and medical services by the front line workers the moment you COVID positive. Sign here.. #publichealth #COVID19 #insurance #NoMasks
20200804	1	Let’s get something straight: no one is comfortable wearing a mask. I don’t wake up every morning excited to cover my face, but I do it anyways b/c it’s the right thing to do for myself and those around me. Just get with it already....#COVID19 #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Many people, including a massive number of idiots in Yakima County did not (and many still don’t) wear masks when advised and then mandated. Many others are only doing it halfway...as in not covering nose and mouth. Bottom line: #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Masks in public places are a necessary prevention tool. You DON'T need to have symptoms to be infected. Many people get Covid and never experience symptoms- They're known as silent Carriers, who are indeed, Spreading the virus.#WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Masks look to be part of our lives for some time to come, so it's more economical (and eco-friendly) to buy one or two cloth masks that you can wash and wear again. They're widely available (look online) and come in a huge range of patterns and colours. #WearAMaskPlease
20200804	1	No need to be patient. Not wearing a mask in public (as mandated by PA Governor) is the equivalent of swinging around a gun with the safety off; somebody’s going to get hurt. That said, I see Philadelphia P/O watch people walk around w/o masks and they say nada! #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Not only did everyone in the church wear a mask ALL THREE PRESIDENTS in attendance wore masks too #WearADamnMask

20200804	1	Over 155,000 Americans have succumbed to Covid-19 and too many more will.  Your right to not wear a mask is disrespectful to all front line workers and your fellow citizens.   Your right to not wear a mask contributes to our country’s horrific toll.  #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	TL/DR:  1. Consistent & correct wearing of masks 2. Avoid crowds & keep a distance of 6+ ft  3. Stay away from crowded places 4. Be outdoors rather than indoors 5. Wash your hands. Use sanitizer if you can't wash. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	1	Yes... right! @Adrieliam is judging and shaming people who don't wear masks because it endangers his health. Exactly! Now Ms Karen Larp... Was that so hard?  Go reward yourself with some cake! #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	You know the whole point of a mask mandate is to WEAR the mask? NOT put it on your ear and let it hang or leave it by your water bottle or not wear it at all. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	You see it's because of populistic morons like yourself that we have trouble getting this virus under control!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200804	1	Your "logic" is typical of the uneducated. Just because THEY didn't die doesn't mean other people won't or won't have life long effects. You really are willing to sacrifice them #COVIDIOTS You probably don't even get the flu shot. Bunch of nutcases you all are #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Your running won’t affect my weight. Your mask wearing will affect my health. If you haven’t figured that out, you’re an idiot. If you have figured it out, you’re incredibly selfish. I run to protect my health. I wear a mask to protect others. Get over yourself. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	Y’all, wearing a mask is great. I can mouth the words to the weird song I have in my head and no one looks at me funny. #WearADamnMask
20200804	1	and yet @DrBonnieHenry @CDCofBC still not a fan of requiring masks. It doesn't make sense. Even Trump and Pence have been wearing and promoting them and that's the bottom of the intellectual barrel! #MasksSaveLives
20200804	1	noah fence but if i can wear a mask outside for 4 and 1/2 hours in the morning then 3 hours during the afternoon in the southern heat for band camp then u can wear a mask to the store <3  #WearAMaskPlease
20200804	1	— frickin’ idea what they’re talking about and how people like her are part of the problem. Sure, masks aren’t the cure for #COVID19 . But it certainly helps in being a preventative from the spread of the virus. So, again, #WearAMaskPlease. #WearAMaskSaveALife

20200804	2	Was out in Evergreen, CO this past weekend.  Lots of people wearing masks -- some groups didn't seem to be carrying them. Mask people stepped to the side.  Many non-maskers did not alter course.  #WearADamnMask
20200804	2	Wearing a mask. #NoMasks
20200804	2	What if we let schools open with only teachers under 40? The death rate would be comparable to other school year viruses we were comfortable with last year. Teachers over 40 can sabatical, and we could get some great new young teachers in the system! #WeWontDieforDOE #nomasks

20200805	0	Nope. I’m afraid they don’t.  *The virus is tiny and easily gets through a cloth or paper mask.  *they give false sense of security &minimise hand washing *they prompt face touching *they are frequently worn incorrectly * they are a litter and infection hazard. #NoMasks

20200805	1	@TweetBluewater Amazing how many people are not wearing masks... maybe use your security team to police it. Felt very unsafe. Suspicious that this many people seem exempt from the rule, especially when they're in friendship groups. It's a health risk! #bluewater #MasksSaveLives
20200805	1	Also sorry that just hit my funny bone I know you dont have an opinion either way .  Also everyone #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
20200805	1	And so many without masks!  Wtf, people? #WearADamnMask
20200805	1	As my friend @LaurenEMorrill says, "I don't know how to explain to you that you should care about other people." This pandemic is ravaging our country, specifically Black and brown communities and the Navajo Nation. Stay home, wear a mask, and save lives. #WearADamnMask
20200805	1	As the virus continues to spread uncontrollably, nearly half the riders in my #metra car today don't have masks. Mandates from the govt and promises from the agency do no good if conductors don't remind riders that masks are required and hand them out as needed. #WearADamnMask
20200805	1	At first I thought the most ridiculous reaction to COVID19 was people panic buying toilet paper... I now see it’s the refusal to wear a mask at the grocery store.   #WearADamnMask
20200805	1	Covid cases are coming down. What we need is someone who can lead us out of this madness. Trump is not ever gonna be the mask guy. On the other hand, if people see their kids back in school, and can go outside without fear and mask harassment, I think he has a shot. #NoMasks
20200805	1	Dear Senator, thank you for all you do to represent Oregon. Hair clippers are fairly inexpensive and easy to use. Or next time you’re in the valley, I’ll even trim your hair, mask and all. And as an educator I have practiced social distancing all summer.    #WearAMaskPlease

20200805	1	I’m tired of the “I have asthma” excuse for not wearing a mask.   One of our regulars, who comes in multiple times a week has asthma. Let’s call him Steve. He wears his mask EVERY TIME.   He also only has oNE LUNG. And he does not complain.   Be like Steve. #WearADamnMask
20200805	1	Just got word that my coworker tested positive for covid-19. He was anti mask and went to parties without any care for the people around him. Now because of him I'm scared for my life.  Please for the love of god, #WearAMask #WearADamnMask

20200805	1	My mask doesn't stop... um, let's say 'Herefordshire scents' but it does keep my mouth dry from rain.  In other words, oxygen can get through masks, but droplets containing the virus cannot.  #WearADamnMask

20200814	1	It's ironic that some people refuse to wear a mask because they say it takes away their freedom, but when you do wear a mask, you have the freedom to go about anywhere & in any store you want to.  Please #WearAMask so we can beat this, then none of us will have to #WearADamnMask
