20200627	0	WA St’s gov  has issued a mandate that we have to be masked -I wish he added costumes. If I have to see the world walk by me in masks & social distance, I would like the world to walk by me in costume w| their character’s signature walk. I think the world needs that. #masks

20200712	0	@ClarkeMicah   Great article in the DM this morning. The most realistic and truthful assessment of this ‘mess’ so far. Good job! Masks are unhealthy, unproven & unnecessary. The only reason for masks is to differentiate who is scared witless and who is not. #NoMasks
20200712	0	@foxandfriends what a shit network!  Trump says there’s a time and a place for masks!  Huge difference between a hospital and your local business.  Propaganda!  #NoMasks
20200712	0	Ice cream shop (walk up only) wouldn’t serve me due to no mask so I went to another place and went through a drive through. So FU ice cream business.  I was standing around people eating with no mask and hanging out. #NoMaskOnMe #MasksareforSheep #MasksOffAmerica

20200713	0	The Left is super supportive of rape survivors when they choose an abortion but calls them “selfish bastards” when they can’t wear masks due to trauma. Keep it up Dems. #VoteDemsOut #RedWave2020 #NoMaskMandates #MyBodyMyChoice #masksdontwork
20200713	0	They need us to be their scapegoat for new outbreaks. Like seat belts they must make wearing masks mandatory to protect the ignorant from themselves.  #MasksSaveLives
20200713	1	@BBCNews 1. You are reporting 78% uptake on masks in many EU countries and 21% here while Brits stay at home to afraid to go out. Could the reason for this be the lack of mask wearing itself? I know its why I won't go out! #WearAMask
20200713	1	A mask under your nose is not a mask. A mask under your chin is not a mask. Walking into the business & THEN putting on your mask is not a mask. Taking your mask off to eat or drink in public is not a mask. Taking your mask off to talk on the phone is not a mask. #MasksSaveLives

20200713	2	I live in NYC, I can assure you Covid 19 is quite real. As I watch it rise across the country, I blame people like you for spewing absolute lies and gaslighting. Trump made this political instead stepping up and leading the entire country through this health crisis. #WearAMask

20200714	0	As a socialist, masks are the ultimate tribute to our final goals. Once people stop seeing each other as individuals, and realize we are only as important as the groups we identify with, only then will we reach true socialism. #WearAMask

20200728	0	ppl with low immunity are dying. They'd likely die of influenza as well. Masks lower ur immunity. U inhale 02 (oxygen) and exhale CO2. What happens to the CO2 around ur mask? U just breathe it back in again increasing ur level of C02. This will lead to more sick ppl! #NoMasks

20200729	0	Ooh, this issue has me conflicted; yes, masks for kids are abhorrent, but profiting from the stupid is so tempting... ultimately, i guess my moral compass would force me to do the right thing and boycott them though. A fool and his money... #idiots #nomasks

20200730	2	Given that the govt has an established track-record of  measures which push large sections of the population into precarity, would it not make sense to question whether lockdown is a continuation of this pernicious theme? Deafening silence from the left, IMO! #Plandemic #NoMasks

20200802	1	Exactly. This is why I have no sympathy for anti-maskers who get COVID and die. They are selfish assholes that don’t understand or care about simple science. Your mask doesn’t protect you, it protects me, and my mask protects you. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Found out a friend of mine, who lives in a very rural area, who also refused to wear a mask and distance - is now in the hospital with #covid. They are doing ok so far, but it’s obviously not just the sniffles. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	Hey @Target on Madison Avenue why are you not enforcing the mask mandate? Most of the people in the store today were not wearing them. I'm a frequent shopper but now I've grounded myself from in-store shopping. DO BETTER. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I am sick to death of you selfish fuckers openly defying store policy and walking around with no mask and daring  someone to challenge you. To the teen whose father dragged her into his narcissism, I apologize for my language. But fuck you too. #WearADamnMask
20200802	1	I was just going to say.  Repubs this week tried to blame protests for Covid increases, but there are still protests in NYC, and other events, and our numbers are still low despite it all.  The difference ...MASKS.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
20200802	1	Spent some time over in England (specifically Derbyshire) for a week. I've a few observations. 1.) From what I saw, mask use in pretty much ubiquitous. 2.) Going into shops is logical, organised and polite. 3.) Coming back to Wales, hardly ANY people wear masks. Scary. #MasksOn
20200802	1	The #TrumpVirus continues to spread … and you want to send CHILDREN to school! SICK BASTARD!! #WearADamnMask

20200803	1	They don’t want to know. Or they know and are just lying. Because they’d rather wear a ventilator than a mask.  Or more likely, they just don’t give a rat’s ass if you or I or someone we love has to wear a ventilator because of them.  #WearADamnMask
