1	I’ve been wondering why almost every photo taken around the world shows everyday people wearing masks... Not in the United States. #trump #coronavirus #masks
1	Why doesn't Pillow Man make MASKS if he wants to be helpful?  #mypillowguy #coronavirusUSA #masks
1	It disturbs me that with everything going on with #covid19 cases sharply rising that #repairmen are not automatically wearing masks! Even when they come into your home. Even the cashier at the #mechanics. This needs to be addressed! #Raleigh #Cary @RoyCooperNC #wakecounty #masks
1	I did...  And it was at least 107° in #Tucson today   - so anyone outside the southwest can kiss my a** if they aren't wearing a mask "because it is too hot"  #WearAMask #Arizona #coronavirus #masks
1	Starting today, people in Marion and Polk counties will be required to wear a face mask when they are in public, indoor spaces. This mandate comes in an attempt to prevent the spread of #COVID19. #Coronavirus #oregon #salemoregon #OR #SalemOR #clypiancoverage #masks
1	There is no covid surge from any demo. Masks masks masks work.  Wear a mask. Get it on.  #covid19 #getiton #masks
0	It’s a felony if you wear a mask while carrying a concealed weapon.   Is that the real reason they want us to wear masks? So they know who to attack.   #masks
1	Today I realized if the solution to climate change was for everyone to just wear a mask, we would still fail. #ClimateCrisis #freedom #masks
1	Of course I wear a mask. What am I, a red shirt on Star Trek? #masks
1	Thank you. I'm nowhere near you to come inlater, but appreciate yr efforts! I'm not front line acute (community hospital) but still had patients test +ve. Ppl are naive. Still threat. Easy transmission, horrible disease. Long term effects. V much not over. #2metres #masks
1	The difference between anti seatbelt & anti mask people is that the latter is leaving a digital footprint of their ignorance for their grandkids.  #masks
1	We cannot afford another economic shutdown. We cannot put those vulnerable at further risk than we can reasonably mitigate. The simple, inexpensive, and mostly effective solution that can curb the virus spread is wearing a mask in public. Stay open and help the vulnerable. #masks
1	@Walmart start protecting your employees and customers and start regulating and mandating masks. I probably have it already as well as 8 other associates in my neighborhood market.  Please at least pretend you care.  They actually help. #masks
1	@realDonaldTrump you should make MAGA masks. Put them on and encourage your supporters to do the same!  #DonaldTrump #maga #masks
1	All Lives Matter? then wear a mask #ALM #BLM #masks
1	I have an idea. Everyone has their temperature taken at the entrance of the bar. Everyone not wearing a mask gets it taken rectally. #masks
1	Only in the us is mask wearing seen as an expression of your political views. #covid19 #masks

1	@AvantiWestCoast I’m in coach F en route to London Euston from Sandwell & Dudley and two people opposite me do not have a facemask on? What is the process as I feel that it is irresponsible and also they’re not following the strict guidelines like others. #covid19 #masks

0	Avoiding places where I would be asked to wear a mask. #NoMask
0	Even though I wear a hearing aid my hearing loss is such that I rely on lip reading- if masks become mandatory people like me will be forced into a life of isolation whilst trying to live day to day, it won’t be worth going out.#NoMask
0	I’m with you on that. I though Boris was a level headed politician, I’m starting to question that.  If you’re more comfortable wearing a mask for protection, then fien, wear one, but don’t force me to wear one too.  Masks only work if the person wearing it is ill.  #MasksOff
0	Masks are as well hiding our facial features which otherwise make us recognizable. By making compulsory to wear them along with the social distancing, are they trying to dehumanise and disconnect us? #MaskeyeHayır #NoToMasks #NoMasks
0	Rex, you do understand there is no medical evidence masks work, right? Not defending the behavior of these 2 dipshits, but wearing a mask does nothing. #masksdontwork
0	So what he’s telling us is that our little face mask won’t save us from getting the virus anyways? Got it! #NoMask
0	The mask wearing Karens are out in force! Are they being paid to be useful idiots, are they actors? This is harassment of the highest order. I wouldn’t have given them the time of day. Dear Karen, leave us alone, keep your distance. #NoMask

2	Hey have we all not got the memo.  99.5 survival rate and climbing?   Take the faulty death counts and surge in faulty testing this thing looks like Joke.   Stop with the fear mongering and government overreach  #NoMask
2	I’m totally with you! #MasksOff
0	Agree .. I hate seeing people wearing them . Can’t read face expressions, can’t hear what’s been said . I like to go out and do my shopping in peace , without people staring at me because I’m not wearing a mask! #NoMask
0	All the technology out today and the best they can do is say wear a mask..lol gtfoh...#NoMasks
0	And definitely don't wear someone else's fear on your face. #MasksOff
0	CDC had an article on its website about d fallacy of wearing masks to prevent spreading this virus. After Peggy Hall exposed it in one of her videos, they removed it before more people get aware of it. #Scamdemic #MasksOff
0	DemonRats think it’s ok to murder the most innocent and defenseless among us, babies in the womb and I’m suppose to wear a mask to protect adults. If your mask works then why do I need one? @LouisianaGov #NoMasks
0	Fuck this covid psyop and fuck your masks.   #MasksOffAmerica
0	I don't give a fuck WHO wears a mask.  NOT DOIN IT!!  And I agree with you.  Didn't make me happy to see him wearing it.   There had a better be a good 5d chess reason for it.  #NoMasks
0	I live in Virginia, I have not worn a mask once, neither will I moving forward. #freedom #MasksOff
0	Mandatory masks would kill the high st #NoMasks
0	Me too. The gov are going for the social shaming tactic ‘ your mask protects me and my mask protects you’. Same nonsence as with vaccines. #NoMasks
0	Meanwhile those who have fallen prey to the panic and hysteria are pushing for a national requirement to wear masks. THAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN #NoMasks
0	Most people I have seen in Ohio don't wear masks. Most People in Ohio can see through this covid 19 "pandemic" hoax. They are not falling for the main stream medias deception. Nice try. Try again. #MasksOnOhio #COVID19 #MasksOffAmerica
0	My 18 year old daughter proved today why masks don’t work and shouldn’t be encouraged or mandated ! She wore it on her head like a headband , wore it on her eyes, flung it across the room, and then I caught her chewing on it!! #NoMasks
0	Now WHO says asymptomatic people can't spread covid. So all the mask wearing and shutdowns were pointless? Time to end this crap. #NoMask
0	Seeing lots of photos of kids wearing face masks. This is brainwashing and child abuse. #nomasksforkids #NoMasks
0	Thanks for the admission that masks DON'T WORK!! #NoMasks
0	Under NO circumstances will I wear a mask to go shopping. I'll stay home and shop online.  If this is Boris's new normal, he can shove it.  #NoMasks
0	Well folks, that weirdo #NealCavuto can skip his Viagra tonight. He finally got to see @POTUS wear a mask. The way the media reacts to this proves it’s so much more symbolic than health related. There are some crazy ass lunatics out there. #MasksOffAmerica
0	Went shopping today w/o a mask.  Clerk was probably forced to have one but, kept pulling it down to come close and talk to me so we could actually communicate.  When they backed away for "social distancing" they pulled their mask back up.  Felt bad for him.  #masksdontwork
0	Why would you wear a mask? You’re not sick. Only sick ppl should be wearing masks.   Knock it off-you look ridiculous!!!   #NoMasks
0	Yes... it IS that simple!  #NoMasks #MasksOff
0	‘In short, cloth masks are largely symbolic. The science hasn’t changed, but the agenda has.’ #masksdontwork
1	It shouldn't be a news headline that Trump has a mask on during a pandemic. It should have been a bigger headline when he had rallies and meetings without a.mask. #coronavirus #NoMask
1	It’s a sad day, that the main news is Trump wears a mask! #MasksOn #NoMasks
1	Yep masks only worn in the O.R. and infection contagion risk areas of high risk patients. And they were not these cheap ass blue and white paper masks they were N95 respirator masks.  #SayNoToMasks
2	Me neither. #SayNoToMasks
2	New title Maskhole. I think I'm going to use this very soon. #coronavirus #NoMasks
2	No shutdowns. Already a mask mandate in most county and local cities. You need to do as McDucey stated in the press conference - Stay Home, Stay Safe, Watch Netflix...or eat outside if you go dining out.   #OpenArizona #FakePandemic #masksdontwork
2	They need mail in voting. In order to accomplish that they need to instill fear and keep schools and universities closed. #masksdontwork
2	Trump wore a mask today. Guess @GavinNewsom will be reversing the silly mask requirement now! #MAGA #KAG #Trump2020 #NoMask
0	Another #fakenews from BBC, there is NO new evidence that mask work, the virus HAS gone, the cure is Hydroxychloroquine, Brazil is flattening the curve with no lockdown. Sweden is OUT OF.COVID with NO LOCKDOWN AND #NoMasks
0	For the first time in his presidency @POTUS looks like an idiot. #MasksOff #masksdontwork
0	Hopefully they're now too scared of this to force the issue, from what we heard Michael Gove say this morning. Fingers crossed!  #NoMasks #MasksOff
0	I got yelled yesterday by some male version of Karen for not wearing mask at the vegetable store . Poor soul was triggered by it and probably had his vagina inflamed for seeing me without mask.    #MasksOffAmerica
0	I wore one yesterday because I felt scared by mask zombies  tutting and sniping  at me  when I  didn't wear one the day before.  On medical grounds,  I'm exempt  anyway . I'm NEVER  repeating yesterday's  experience again and will not wear a mask again.   #NoMasks
0	If a piece of underwear can’t stop the smell of a fart how can a cloth mask stop a virus... #masksdontwork
0	I’m not wearing a mask ever. #masksdontwork
0	Ok, I’ve just gotta say it...MASKS SHOULD NOT BE FASHION STATEMENTS! If you want to wear one, that’s fine w/me but the thought that people are making & buying pattered masks is actually terrifying. Wake up and think! Wake up and fight!!! #saynotomasks #MasksOffAmerica #NoMasks
0	SERIOUS QUESTION ~ If you had ONLY 7 days LEFT to LIVE your LIFE, would you STILL WEAR a MASK and AVOID your family and friends? Would you CONTINUE to STAND 6ft. apart from everyone? Would you NOT GIVE ANYONE a HUG? #NoMasks
0	Someone needs to do a study on how many ardent mask-wears got COVID-19 since we all know (including the government) that masks don’t work. #MasksOffAmerica
1	 ZERO COVID DEATHS in NY!!!   Common Sense, Pays!!!   Science & Medicine, Pays!!!   The Use of Masks and Testing, Pays!!!   Daily Briefings with True Information, Pays!!!   Well Done @NYGovCuomo @andrewcuomo !!!   #newyorktough #WearAMask
1	130,000 families know who had it. Another 100,000+ are hospitalized. I suppose you think they're all actors paid for by Soros and the Clinton foundation. #WearAMask
1	3. In many countries these are being handed free out at metros, supermarkets, town halls and doctor's surgeries. Home made ones don't usually clip over the nose so are pretty useless. Why is England so arrogant that it won't learn from other countries? #WearAMask
1	@ProjectLincoln is driving you fucking crazy, and we love it!!! Truth hurts you piece of shit!  day’s until we #voteforJoeBiden#WearAMask
1	@calhouns So you won’t have employees wear mandated face masks?  So long.  Will NEVER frequent your restuarants!!  Maybe you could not enforce the smoking law too.  #calhouns #knoxville #WearAMaskSaveALife

1	All the more recent evidence points to their effectiveness but you're quite right the precautionary principle demanded they be used. #Masks4All
1	Also, I bought a new *reusable* mask in @SuperValuIRL for a fiver and I'm BUZZING to add it to my collection. why'd I buy it? Well because 1. I cannot sew and 2. I can't be asking my auntie to make me more masks but 3. I WANT ALL THE MASKS #WearAMask
1	Awesome @DoroLef ! Great to see so many caring people around the world ! #MaskWearersAroundtheworld #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
1	But far fewer, as they tend to adhere to the droplets of moisture in your breath and these get trapped in your mask.  You DO realise the point of a mask is to protect others rather than yourself, don't you?  #WearAMask
1	China 1.4B population inside of 3.705 million sq miles 68k confirmed corona cases 63k recovered 4.5k deaths 90M tested  USA 331M population inside of 3.797 million sq miles 3.3M confirmed corona cases 1.5M recovered 137k deaths 42M tested  Which one wore a mask? #WearAMask

1	Get use to being uncomfortable, so ADAPT to NEW NORMAL! WEAR THE MASK! #WearAMask
1	Guess they were too busy watching @FoxNewsSunday to have seen the video of the man who refused to wear a mask, tested positive, died with regret over his bad decision. #WearAMask
1	Hey Republicans and other #trumpanzees If you do as that orange fool in the WH tells you about #Covid_19 you will die. You are letting that fool lead you to an early grave. Now, if that’s ok with you, then go right ahead. But you dummies won’t take me with you. #WearAMask
1	Hey so, something weird happened when I went to get my mums medication, some guy honked his car horn at me and gave me a thumbs up, was it because I was wearing a mask? #Covid_19 #WearAMask
1	How did we get to the greatest public health failure of our time?  Months ago Americans were asked to wear a mask to save a life.  Not enlist, not run into a burning building, simply wear a mask.  And America said "No".    #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I guess I should’ve know any effort to flatten the curve that depended on an overwhelming majority of Americans to refrain from being self-centered was doomed to fail. #WearAMask
1	I hung a "Help Us Stay Open, Please wear a mask in our shop" sign on our door this morning.  Mom & Pop shops don't have sick days.  We don't have employees.  Cases in our county are rising fast (thank you, evangelical revival & church camp attendees).  #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I know everyone’s freaked about American tourists coming to Ireland but I was shopping in dunnes earlier & half the shop weren’t wearing masks  can we at least try to get it right ourselves, please #WearAMask
1	I totally agree  in a bubble with my mum and dad now, who are still sheilding as vulnerable, but will not take any chances as I am doing their shopping, etc  #SaveLives #WearAMask
1	I try to be unbiased on my Twitter.  Which is why I’m saying Wear A Mask.  Because wearing a mask isn’t political or partisan. It’s common sense and kind to your fellow human.  We all have to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.  #WearAMask
1	I was at @ShopprsDrugMart yesterday and the lady behind me was refused entry for not having a mask, it was great! #WearAMask
1	I wonder if we said new evidence supported #COVID19 was an attack on the world from socialist space aliens, would we see more people start wearing masks? #boringIndependenceDay #WelcometoEarth #WearADamnMask #WearAMask
1	I work 10 hours in a 96 degree wearhouse walking 20,000+ steps a day and lifting heavy boxes and I wear a mask. STOP COMPLAINING YOU CANT BREATH WELL ENOUGH TO WALK 30 MiN WITH A MASK. #WearAMask
1	If you haven’t been wearing a mask in #SanDiego yet, the air from the #Navyfire leaves you no choice now. Quality right now is very mixed. The smell is definitely potent and it can’t be good to take in and mess up the respiratory system now. #StayHome #WearAMask
1	If you think wearing a mask makes you look stupid, when's the last time you looked in the mirror? #WearAMask
1	Just try test driving what you think your Constitutional rights are... you’ll get kicked out of Bass Pro Shop...and anywhere else you try to shop without a mask.  You do not have the right to put other people’s health in danger.  #WearAMask
1	Lets just remember that its not the policy around face masks which will ruin the high streets   Its the opinions and views of those who are ignorant and entitled which will damange high streets.   Just get on with it and stop moaning #facemasks #WearAMask

1	People who like to sew: a fat quarter of fabric is the perfect size to make two pleated masks :) cut it in half then in half again and double up two squares to make one mask. Make pleats By making 3-4 folds, sew the edges, and add ties. Done. #normalisemaskwearing #WearAMask
1	Person on the BBC today said she won’t wear a mask because she’s Claustrophobia. I mean come on!  #WearAMask
1	Putting this out for the world out of true curiosity. For people who choose not to wear masks. What would you have to see in order for you to put one on? #facemasks #NoMask

1	So far so good on the bus, only one passenger not wearing a mask however a few people need to learn to wear a mask properly #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	So many people on Twitter saying they won’t be wearing a mask. They need to stop being so dramatic and get on with it. I would rather not have another harsh lockdown in the winter. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Thank you for doing all you can to help more people accept that wearing a #mask is one simple way to  help stop the spread - and isn’t difficult! #JustWearIt #Masks #Masks4All
1	Truly can see "ignorance is bliss," when a Florida woman says I shouldn't wear a mask and to not fear the virus because she doesn't. I don't fear getting the virus but have respect for others and refuse encourage this ignorance. #WearAMask
1	Trumps cronies are now making it known that there is no negative to wearing a mask.. @realDonaldTrump finally wears a mask..its a shame its 3 months too late. You have already killed or permantly damanged half of of America ( physically, financially and mentally) #WearAMask

1	Wearing your mask below your nose is like using a condom with the tip cut off. Absolutely Worthless. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Welp considering the it’s the States who are being travel banned right now and more people have died then in wars, maybe it’s not a hoax?  Ps had Trump taken Covid seriously, economy probably wouln’t have crashed like it did  #consequences #WearAMask
1	What’s Schantz.   The Democrat Governors of WA and NY have both done a great job combatting #COVID19..  The Democrat mayor of NYC is a damn idiot tho.  Don’t be a #COVIDIOT, Kris.  #WearAMask
1	YIKES! @AmericanAir is usually my preference.  Hard N.O. If they don’t enforce their mask wearing policy!  #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	You are Not allowed into the UK Disney stores without a face mask as it’s company policy, they had someone on the door handing out masks to those without one. As a young person I am happy to wear a mask during this time and hope it becomes compulsory in shops. #WearAMask

2	The experts and media portrayed Sars-cov-2 as a supernatural virus which you couldn't create immunity to, you could get a second time, would never go away (as all corona viruses do), etc. Temp check is what is done when I go for facial. Makes tons of sense. #NoMasks

0	Weird how many doctors say masks aren't the answer except in situations like surgery to avoid coughing or sneezing into an open incision.   Masks don't block viruses anyway.  Our health is damaged if we restrict our breathing. Our immune system too.   Goodbye.  #NoMasks
1	@DisneyParks I am going to be very disappointed if you do not provide your employees with #DonaldDuck bill or #Goofy mouth #n95 masks while the parks are open.  #disney #coronavirus #florida #california #masks #WearAMask

0	So let me get this straight: you have to wear a mask or everyone will die unless you’re sitting and eating or protesting, which makes the virus safe? Also, mask= safe, shirt over face=everyone dies? It’s not just that the rules are wrong, they’re arbitrary. #nomasks

0	Yeah.... Actually no, the guidance has been a joke & the why has been for corporate money making. Am over 50, v healthy, don't wear a mask (ever) or social distance (oxymoron). Won't have a vaccine, nor will I shield for a disease that's virtually gone in the UK. #KBF #NoMasks
0	Your argument; anyone who disagrees doesn't have a voice, hmm nicely fascist. If lockdown is the 'only' reason, why was one not needed for previous pandemics? So to stop numbers going up, we need to lockdown forever? Strange how a simpleton can fault your logic. #KBF #NoMasks
1	#facemasks are mostly effective when wore by the sick people. As it is difficult to know who is sick and who is not, if mass people #WearAMask in public places it can significantly reduce the spread of the virus. #WearAMaskPlease
1	#sundayvibes don’t consider yourself a pro life Republican if you won’t wear a mask  #WearADamnMask
1	@InsidersABC @CaseyBriggs From what my Melburnian friends are reporting, the restrictions aren’t working because PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE WITHOUT MASKS & gathering in groups for picnics & sitting outside restaurants & cafes with their takeaways. #StayHomeSaveLives #WearADamnMask
1	@MassGovernor agrees and has launched a new campaign to highlight the continued importance of wearing masks   #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
1	A guy with no mask just knocked on my door. I have big loud dogs, he backed away. I stuck my head out and he yelled across the yard. He's selling frozen beef. Holy hell, he came to my door with no mask. #WearADamnMask
1	A question to the people wearing their masks on their chins...do you think it’s doing anything  #CoverYourFace
1	Agreed nothing is perfect, but don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Bottom line, if we all wear our masks we are all significantly less likely to get sick.  Do your part and #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Am I ever going to learn that my phone doesn’t recognize me when I have my mask on? But still...#WearADamnMask
1	Another question...do the people wearing the masks below their nose know it is also connected to their lungs? #CoverYourFace
1	As of 38 minutes ago, my 3 kids and I entered day 150 of lockdown. That's 150 days that I haven't seen any of my family, friends or another adult because I'm trying to keep my #immunocompromised son safe. It makes me angry that so many people won't even wear a mask.#WearADamnMask
1	Because a lot of people STILL refuse to wear masks, and stay physically distant from others, I'm gearing up for some GREAT holidays, such as:  Hallowzoom Zoomsgiving Christzoom Zoom Year's Eve Zoomukkah Kwanzoom  #WearADamnMask
1	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.  #WearADamnMask
1	Bullshit. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Daily reminder: every time you see a person without a mask outside, remember: they're the reason this pandemic STILL isn't over yet...  #WearADamnMask
1	Dr Nick, I agree it’s brilliant...but I’m disappointed that so many comments here show that either people lack a sense of humour!  and/or don’t get how essential both vaccinations and mask wearing are for our survival! Shocking!  #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives #MasksOn
1	Face masks are a lot like condoms. Nobody WANTS to wear em but, you should be wearing them to keep yourself and others safe. #WearADamnMask
1	Finally went out after dialing it WAY back after the shutdowns.  I’m very happy to report everyone in sight is wearing a mask, socially distancing and not a single Karen/Kevin. Still a little gun shy about being out, but I am encouraged.  #WearADamnMask
1	For those who say #COVID19  isn't any worse than the flu, I give you MATH (but you can't really compare these 2)  2018-19 US flu season deaths were 34,200 (@CDCgov)  % increase using US CV19 deaths (157,396 SO FAR)   = 360% increase. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY PERCENT! #WearADamnMask
1	Go @Delta  These stories are too frequent! Mandatory mask requirement AND every airline needs to make it clear to every single passenger there WILL be prosecution with minimum of a $10,000 fine if there’s an incident regarding #Mask. Ppl need to comply w/ rules! #WearADamnMask
1	Great job @Delta for having the courage to kick the people who refused to wear masks off your flight! #WearADamnMask
1	Happy birthday  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	He's an expert, you're a failed tv host/failed businessman (who bankrupted a casino!) so I'll go with Dr. Fauci.  The US has more cases due to your FAILURE to act, FAILURE to lead #TrumpVirus #ImPOTUS #TrumpGolfsYouDie #PutinsPuppet #PutinsGOP #WearADamnMask
1	Helpful hint for your gaslit trumpanzee friends (if you’re into that):  Put your mask on. Don’t mess with it. Wash your hands often.  #MasksDontKill #WearADamnMask
1	Here’s the thing, I support responsible gun owner rights but if you own one for protection in case someone tries to hurt you but you won’t wear a mask, isn’t that a bit ironic? Neither one 100% guarantees your survival but it could possibly help, right? #WearAMaskPlease
1	Hey @MishaBotBot Please tell me you wear a mask! Everyone, even Bots have a responsibility to help slow the spread of Covid-19. #WearADamnMask
1	I am so fucking tired of GROWN ADULTS whining and complaining about having to wear a mask in our restaurant. I'm sorry..are you not an ADULT? is it too hard to be a fucking grown up?! #WearADamnMask
1	I assume all of the Sheriffs, who weren’t social distancing or wearing masks, had Covid tests the past two days to confirm multiple negative tests?   As a Republican, I know we can do better Mr. President.  #WearADamnMask
1	I didn't know that wearing a mask and staying at home was mission impossible, like damn man. Ya'll had one job and managed to fuck it up. Smh #WearADamnMask
1	I don’t need to read the article - it’s because they’re selfish and short sighted.  We’re in the middle of an out of control pandemic, what does wearing a mask hurt?!  #MaskItOrCasket #WearAMaskPlease
1	I don’t understand these people who will not wear a mask . Inconsiderate fools. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I have cancer, I do not go out except for blood tests and chemo.  There are people in line at Quest with no mask, even though their sign says "no entry without a mask".  I would like to go out, shop, eat in a restaurant, but I am terrified. #WearADamnMask
1	I live in a state with a Democratic governor. Masks in public places have been mandatory since at least June 1.  I shopped in 3 different stores today. Everybody was masked, and I didn’t hear a single “but muh freedums.” #WearADamnMask
1	I mean, I get it, a mask is uncomfortable, it fogs your glasses, it gets hot, it becomes a nuisance after wearing it for a long time; but gosh, it shouldn’t be politicized! For your heath’s sake & that of others, wear it! It may save your life. #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I see a lot of robust bellies, no masks, no life preservers. You can almost feel the covid that’s inevitable. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
1	I will be angry if I happily man ED wearing N95 entire time, stopped counting high-risk procedures or + pts, batch shifts to sequester in hotel to protect #CHD 13yo daughter, test 9x neg, all in last 6mo only to get #COVID19 from stranger w/ no mask.  AL pls #WearADamnMask
1	I'm not condoning violence, but why are all the stories about people catching a beating over masks about people who actually comply? You would think the non-mask wearers would be the ones on the run. #MaskItOrCasket #WearADamnMask
1	If Anne Frank could live in a secret annex with seven other people for two years. I can wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	If a mask mandate could help save lives and violates the law, CHANGE! THE! LAW! NOT having the mandate could actually be helping kill people, do you really want that on your shoulders @GovRicketts? #youcandoit #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	If you're not willing to wear a mask at a grocery store (even when it's mandatory), could you at least utilize their delivery or pickup options (which is often free)? You are gaining nothing. Does the thrill of walking down the cereal really mean that much to you?  #WearADamnMask
1	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO. #MaskMoaners
1	It is because some GOP Congress people are not wearing their masks!!!For same. #WearADamnMask
1	It's you vs. the virus. The ONLY way to win is to stop it from spreading by depriving it of future hosts. That means staying the fuck home and wearing a damn mask if you MUST leave the house.  #WearADamnMask
1	It’s good to see a shift in consumer behavior re: masks when corporations (esp. those that serve non-compliant areas) enact rules. Virtually no masks ~1mo ago at my parent’s local @Walmart. Today? >70% compliance. (Both observations based on my experience.) #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	It’s incorrect but it if makes you feel better it’s simple: stay home as much as possible, wear a fabric mask when you do have to go out and get some surgical masks if you need to be out for extended periods of time.  You’re welcome #WearADamnMask
1	It’s time for people to act responsibly. There is enough evidence that masks work. Adults shouldn’t have to be told to wear a mask. It’s not a political statement it’s what makes us all safer. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I’m so late to the party @Twitter Please excuse me. How’s #QuarantineLife? #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
1	Just a little, they do want you to wear masks if you can, but drop them down for the lovely deaf girl. So we was served by her. #NoMask
1	LOTS of masks in the mall today. YAY!! @CornwallCentre @RealTenille #WearADamnMask
1	Let's be clear: it is all our business if you are not wearing a mask in our presence. This is not just about you. You don't have a right to kill those around you. If you harm someone for reminding you to wear a mask. You will be charged. Stop being selfish!! #WearADamnMask
1	Look a #COVIDIOT #TrumpDeathCult member. #resist the #TrumpDeathCult they want to kill us all. @GavinNewsom @SupervisorCox @SupFletcher @ToddGloria we need protection from the virus and domestic terrorists like anti mask guy. #Gettested #StaySafeStayHome #WearADamnMask
1	Look at all these people at @NASA and @SpaceX doing their jobs, keeping @Astro_Doug & @AstroBehnken safe and informed while social distancing and wearing masks. You guys rock.    #WearADamnMask
1	MEEEE EEITHERRR! Stay home~ stay alive! Social distance Wear a mask Wash hands frequently These are our only defenses And these are such simple things~ not like a series of shots in the ass! Or a double lung transplant.. #152000AmericansDead #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Man on train keeps removing mask to sneeze into hand . Man without mask has just got on and shaken hands with him ... I despair for humanity  #COVIDIOTS #facecoverings #CoverYourFace

1	Morning Rebels   Off to work I go  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskPlease
1	My new nightmare in my sleep is not going to jail, is not robbery or falling. My new nightmare is forgetting to wear my mask in public and dying from the coronavirus. Do me a favor, to reduce my anxiety wear a fucking mask or stay at home. Thank you. #WearAMaskPlease
1	Neil, stop being a snowflake and wear a mask. It won’t be forever, and it will help the most vulnerable to be protected against covid19. I wear one every day at work, it’s no big deal. #WearAMaskPlease
1	New York state has been wearing masks since early April. We now have very low case numbers. At one point over 300/ were dying. Now we are in the single digits. #WearADamnMask
1	No mask? Careless, self-centered no concern for anyone else’s health. Don’t be like Joe #WearADamnMask
1	No, we have more cases because you said it was a hoax and no one wants to wear masks. Also teenagers are having large parties because they think they are invincible. #WearADamnMask
1	No... You're not a "bad person" necessarily... you're just... obviously... tragically... not too smart. Too easily larped. This isn't D&D... a spell won't save you. Herman Cain didn't wear a mask, and now he's dead. Don't be like #HermanCain. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	None of the employees are wearing masks at @BootsUK and @SourcedMarket at @StPancrasInt ! How disrespectful to the weak and elderly. Sort it out! #Covid_19 #coronavirus #nomasks
1	Not to mention travel benefits by bringing his family on a Gov't Challenger Jet and not wearing masks whilst Ms. May and Min. Qualtrough did on board. #cdnpoli #IStandWithTrudeau #ScheerStupidity #ByeScheer #WearADamnMask
1	Not true. Also, there is currently a vaccine for the flu. Why are you trying to minimize this pandemic? People are dying every minute in this country because the federal government is leaderless and has politicized the one thing that could mitigate it. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Not wearing a mask is "small dick energy."  #WearADamnMask
1	Now there's a guy eating an entire meal with his mask around his chin.  Is eating even allowed on @cta trains?  #WearADamnMask
1	Oh, so you don't want to wear a mask? Well, hey I'm not so crazy about pants, but I do whats best for my neighbors #coronavirus #MasksOn
1	On the bus. Out of the 6 people on the lower deck only 2 have their masks on properly 3 have their mouths covered but their nose poking out and one has it round their neck. Just what is the point? It’s really not that hard #WearADamnMask
1	Or.... you can wear a mask when going out and near other people! #WearADamnMask
1	Our ancestors fought against people being gassed you complete sausage. A mask in a shop for 20 minutes is first world selfish mother fucking problems. #WearADamnMask
1	Over 148,000 Americans  have died. We are not showing them any respect or learning from the senseless deaths that could be avoided by wearing a mask. Obviously Washington County and other counties are failing as  #COVID19 # 's keep #WearADamnMask
1	People need to strap up and MASK up!! Americans sacrificed so much during WW2 and now they can’t even wear a mask at Target for 5 minutes without having a hissy fit!! #WearADamnMask

1	RT if you have at least one mask hanging from the rear view  mirror of ya car  #MasksOnOhio #MasksOn
1	Raging at the impudence around me. I keep meeting +Covid people who don't wear a mask whose family refuses testing and wearing masks but STILL go around the community. This is not a joke your SELFISHNESS is killing your loved ones, caregivers, my friends, humanity. #WearADamnMask
1	So 9 out of 10 members of Congress with Covid-19 is a Republican. Doesn’t that antidotal added to science tell you something? Covid-19 doesn’t care about your politics but the politics of the Republican Party have made it worse. #WearADamnMask
1	So nobody wears a mask in South Carolina???    #WearADamnMask
1	Spending the afternoon watching a 3-on-3 youth soccer tournament at @etownsportspark. Beautiful day...but a shame there’s no signage or enforcement of mask wearing. Come on...we can do better! @KYHealthAlerts #WearADamnMask
1	Taking a scroll through Instagram right now...I didn’t know the pandemic was over! Congrats everyone!! Hope you enjoyed your big night out.   I’ll just huddle over here behind my mask as school starts in two weeks. #WearADamnMask
1	The longer your boss and the GOP pushes not wearing a mask the longer this crisis will linger and we’ll all suffer and STILL HAVE TO WEAR A MASK. #WearADamnMask
1	The realization of how many think we're nvincible to #COVID19 was never more apparent until we saw people actually walk into the funeral home with no mask defying our state order. You're literally standing with the dead all around you and you still don't get it. #WearADamnMask
1	The world we live in... a simple face covering becomes another battle front in the fight for our humanity.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
1	These countries ISOLATED - broke the vector. The truth is studies reveal there's likely 10x more virus out there than positive testing results. DON'T BE A VECTOR... #SocialDistancing #WearADamnMask
1	These hypocrites like @KevinMcCarthyTV are still arguing about wearing masks-unbelievable  #Hypocrisy #WearADamnMask
1	Tomorrow #NH will host a #NASCAR race that is expected to draw 12K.  We are the only state in the entire Norteast w/out a mask mandate. This is a potential #COVID19 superspreader event. You may be “over” the pandemic - but it’s not over you. #WearADamnMask
1	Turned up to our worksite to paint yesterday. 6 concreters, 2 chippies, 2 pool blokes, all without masks on and working in the one area. We walked off site and got eyes rolled at us and laughed at. #WearADamnMask
1	WI Gov Evers just passed mandatory masks statewide effective today. GOP state legislators already fighting the mask law and threatening lawsuit to WI Supreme Court to overturn. New WI SC Dem Justice just took seat today. So GOP may not succeed#WearADamnMask
1	Was out at Target Express in Cupertino earlier this afternoon, noticed a shopper sans mask #WTF #WearADamnMask
1	Watching the @penguins play in an empty arena is sad. Mostly because people won't wear freaking masks so this is what it has come to. #WearADamnMask
1	We HAVE to start calling it out. These ppl defending not wearing masks are idiots. I have no problem w ppl's stupidity only affecting them.  But I have a BIG problem w Us All having to be at risk delayed and inconvenienced because a Ken and/or a Karen won't just #WearADamnMask
1	We NOW have Thousands of maskless churchgoers congregating together on the beaches of hot spot California. No masks. For civil liberty. I guess the constitution guarantees the Unalienable right to spread their disease.  #NoMasks
1	Wearing a mask and social distancing doesn't mean you are "living in fear." It's like wearing a seat belt or using your headlights in the rain, it's for your safety and the safety of others.  #WearADamnMask
1	Welp. My immuno-compromised husband & I can't go on evening walks in the park anymore because here in Pittsburgh, the HOTSPOT of PA, only about 1/3 of people are wearing masks.   Hey Pittsburgh, if you're going out, WEAR YOUR MASKS! #Pittsburgh #WearADamnMask
1	What, are they children??? Grow up ppl & wear the damn mask! This is not about politics, not about Liberty and not about YOU.  It is about 150K FELLOW AMERICANS who have NEEDLESSLY DIED bc of ignorant & selfish choices made by others.  #WearADamnMask

1	Why can’t people follow rules and wear a darn mask?! #MaskUp #MasksSaveLives

1	Your use of ‘Dr Fartzy’ speaks volumes about you.  Doctors and nurses survive long shifts in serious medical masks. #WearADamnMask
1	that's nonsense:  masks reduce the distance water droplets from your mouth spread, thereby lowering the likelihood of the virus spreading (the virus travels in water droplets) stop your whining, stop spreading misinformation and #WearADamnMask
1	“A sleep-away camp in Georgia: Of the 600 campers and staff members, nearly half became infected within a week of orientation. The camp took precautions but did not require campers to wear masks. Singing and cheering may have helped spread the virus.” #noshit #WearADamnMask

2	Don’t blame the governor, it is 45’s lack of leadership that has lead to these problems. Deaths didn’t start going crazy until businesses started opening up early, under pressure of federal government.  #TrumpsDeathToll157K #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #extendthe600 #WearADamnMask

1	141 days into the US #COVID19 pandemic. With all the information we have about the benefit of wearing #masks, if you aren’t, you are responsible for the continued spread, deaths, illness, closures, financial ruin, and ongoing horror! #WearADamnMask
1	25% OF WORLD DEATHS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE 4% OF WORLD POPULATION!!!! @WhiteHouse @PressSec @kayleighmcenany SPIN THAT, KAYLEIGH!! And DR. BIRX!! #GOPDeathCult #BloodOnTrumpsHands #WearADamnMask
1	26yrs old, finally figured out a skincare routine that works, hairstyle and clothes that I actually like, healthy eating habits and my career. I am FLOORED that I can’t go out to celebrate my glow up lol. Wear your fucking masks people. #WhatWomenReallyWantIs #WearADamnMask
1	@GavinNewsom pls doing an ad campaign on how to wear your mask properly. So many ppl are not. Especially those making an$ handling our food #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	@JayaTigerLily is just ad nauseum repeating her diatribe. One where she offers no science, no logic, no evidence that is abreast with understanding and advisories issued by health authorities. She is sabotaging efforts to create awareness here on Masks! #WearADamnMask
1	@Lowes employee correct mask wearing 100% Customer mask wearing 90% Customer correct mask wearing 50% #coveryournose     Special shoutout to the woman wearing a chin guard  #WearADamnMask
1	A face mask in not impeding your everyday life. I just went into a sandwich shop and a sausage bap, wearing a face covering. It's so simple...#WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Allow me to save you the time-here’s what he’ll say -“...blah, blah blah, lower case numbers, blah, schools are fine, blerp, Trump calls me Eric, blah, no state mask order, blerp.”                         #DeSantisResign #DeathSantis #DeSantisLiesFloridiansDie #WearADamnMask
1	BOYCOTT 7-11!  Front Royal is known for non mask wearers. They have a demo derby, tractor pull etc coming up and I know the stands will be filled with peeps not wearing masks. The worst thing is 10 days later those kids go back to school.  #notuntilwearesafe #WearADamnMask
1	Bars, restaurants, sports, premature reopening, antimasking, and quarantine fatigue are all what make the US #1.  I'm still in disbelief that these public health measures are debated. #WearADamnMask
1	Day 1292 with a contagious haiku: Endless quarantine. America is broken. Wear your fucking mask. #WearADamnMask
1	Dear Entitled White Women - Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. You are an embarrassment to white women who actually give a shit about all humans. No matter their skin color, sexual orientation, religion, or origin. #WearADamnMask
1	Didn’t u hear? Per one FL woman, she shouldn’t have 2 wear a mask 4 the same reason she doesn’t wear underwear: cause “things gotta breathe”. How many fatal underwear-wearing incidents have you heard of? And what does this lady do when it’s her time of the month? #WearADamnMask
1	Do we not cover and protect various other organs from our environment? Have we evolved to have skin that doesn't burn into cancerous lesions? How many examples do you need @NeilClark66 before you understand that your opinion of mask-wearing is utter nonsense #WearADamnMask
1	Don’t burp while wearing a mask. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
1	He’s not a pastor. He’s a pretentious anal retentive self righteous princess jackass. Probably a closet Colonel Frank Fitz: A product of his own self antagonistic orientation. Send him a mask, not a gift card. #fools #WearADamnMask
1	Hubs is in #Phoenix with a load. He said NO ONE is wearing masks. Makes me sad that my home state can’t get their shit together. Makes me even more mad because that’s where we caught #COVID19 back in March. #MasksSaveLives
1	I can't stand #MAGAts #DEPLORABLES #TrumpSupporters, but even I don't want any of them taking #Hydroxychloroquine. It is NOT a cure for the #coronavirus. #COVID19 is serious and deadly.  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
1	I come from 6 months into the future and let me tell you all you looked really cute in your christmas themed facemasks.  #christmas #facemask #facecover #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I have seen 6 people within 30 minutes in geelong who aren’t wearing a mask  #WearADamnMask
1	I used to laugh at people and call them babies when they complained about having to wear a mask in stores or at work. Now that I’ve had to wear one 8 hours a day for a week:  I still laugh, and they’re still babies. #WearADamnMask
1	I wish someone would tell the millions of medical staff world wide the masks they are wearing are:  > Government tracking devices  > Aliens that will attack and eat their faces.   I hope they find out soon. Thoughts and prayers.    #COVID19 #Masks #MaskMoaners
1	I worry every time I go to work that I'm risking my family to keep our home. I see so many people who don't wear a mask, or who are wearing them improperly, that my anxiety runs rampant during every shift. #MaskUpWA #WearADamnMask
1	I'm 60 and I wear a mask.  My mom is 89 and she wears a mask.  Don't tell me you are too old to wear a mask.  #WearADamnMask
1	I'm hoping that I have by wearing my mask since March. #WearADamnMask
1	If my 56 year old mother can wear a N95 mask in 100 degree weather, with all her EMS gear on, and take care of patients in sometimes horrible living conditions. You can wear a mask for the 15 minutes while you shop. #WearADamnMask
1	If you think wearing a mask is inconvenient, then trying having Covid. It's more than inconveniencing. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Instead of going on every right wing talk show and pushing dangerous ineffective compounds like some travelling quack, tell the truth.   The best way to deal with Covid-19 isn’t a drug.  It’s not contracting it in the first place.   #WearADamnMask
1	Is there still a pandemic or not? Everyone out there having their best summer life and I'm like this sucks #socialdistancing #Covid_19 #WearADamnMask
1	It may not be a representative sample, but it was still really gratifying seeing nearly everyone at the @MortonArboretum wearing masks yesterday on the paths. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	It’s a slippery slope, first masks, then seatbelts, then brushing your teeth. Control and compliance is real. Resist common sense!! Go @DerekSloanCPC #WearADamnMask
1	It’s very scary to see how many people aren’t wearing masks or social distancing. We all need to do our part. It’s not that hard. #WearADamnMask
1	I’m not religious but this little ditty popped into my head today... Maybe this will help those who proclaim to be “Christian” with wearing a mask.    “Wear a mask and say your prayers because Jesus and Corona are everywhere.”  -#WearADamnMask
1	I’m sorry for your loss. I heard someone moaning about not being able to breathe with a mask on. I believe covid doesn’t help you breathe either. I know one I would rather have and it’s not the latter #WearADamnMask
1	Let me get this straight: you want to not only fly right now, but have the audacity to not wear a mask.  #Delta then said I’m turning this thing around like a MOTHER because y’all are acting like CHILDREN #WearADamnMask
1	Look at all the gear our medical professional are wearing but folks want to whine and complain about wearing a mask?? #WearADamnMask
1	Making fucking masks a law.  That’s it.  Seatbelts save lives.  Masks do to!  #WearADamnMask
1	McD's food is proven addictive. This heavy-handed action equates a dealer to an addict - wear a mask or don't get your hit  #HoaxVirus #NoMask
1	Me: Sorry masks are now mantatory  #DearCustomer : I don't have to wear one because I'm a selfish inconsiderate jerk!  (or maybe that's just what I hear) #WearADamnMask
1	Morning Rebels   Im back to work full time. Back to telling people to cover their nose, back to telling people to #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearAMaskPlease
1	Never realised how popular @WuTangOfficial became. However protecting ya neck isn’t going to protect you from corona. Wear your mask correctly in public places, cover your mouth and nose. Protect your loved ones, your fellow humans and yourself. #CoronaKills #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	No. No one should be allowed to board a plane without a mask. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Not ashamed to mask-shame #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Omg people say I have to wear a mask and I'm crying because I have to wear a mask to save lives boo hoo!! MAGAts are stupid!!! #WearADamnMask
1	Relative risk management. Masks required now. Do the decent thing and wear one. It’s no big deal really, I have to wear one every day at work, and it helps protect the most vulnerable from covid19 #WearAMaskPlease
1	Shopping at @WinCoFoods  Me to "lady": If you're not gonna wear a mask, please don't stand next to me or my kid.  Her maga mask half ass wearing husband: ShE hAs A illnEsS, diCk!  Me: Then wear a fucking mask, idiot!  Him: FuCk YoU, cOmMuNiSt cUnT!  Awful humans. #WearADamnMask
1	So its the first day of compulsory masks here and i just went to the post office and on the way i passed a girl holding her mask in her hand and then both of the staff at the post office had their masks down on their chins. #WearADamnMask
1	Tbh, I'll be far less mental than I am now.   I'm diabetic, and the general public are not taking this pandemic seriously enough for me to feel safe outside.  I've apparently a one in ten chance of dying if I catch Covid, so lockdown honestly sounds ideal.  #WearADamnMask
1	Thank you for that!!! - Time for a quick walk then.  #stayathome #WearADamnMask
1	That representative from Texas said almost the same crap in his mind, refused to wear a mask when asked...Guess what, God doesn’t appreciate that crap...he’s now dealing with Covid-19 wherever he is. #WearADamnMask
1	That’s because you’re a Karen and a trump lover. If you really cared for the people that deserve to live on this planet. You would wear a damn mask. Good luck for when you might need a ventilator soon. Us Normal people are going to wear masks to survive. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	The Whitehouse Cowboy is a slow learner, but even he realises that masks slow the spread of Covid. I’d rather listen to medical specialists- WHO, CDC than the quack Immanuel spouting about dream sex with demons causing Covid. Viruses don’t have a political agenda? #WearADamnMask
1	The most interesting thing is how the ones who’ve hollered about the masks being unnecessary and that the virus isn’t real are the ones now getting coronavirus. Know who aren’t getting it? Most people who’ve been wearing masks the whole time. #WearADamnMask
1	The people who say wearing a mask is "living in fear" are the same people who are afraid of sharing a public restroom with a transgender person. #COVIDIOT #WearADamnMask
1	The protesters in my town wear masks, just like everyone else that can't social distance. Masks work. #WearADamnMask
1	Then leave the shop immediately and go somewhere else.The public health advice is to use your common sense, if a place is crowded or feels unsafe, leave. Just imagine being in a classroom with 25 teenagers and no masks,  that what our government wants in 4 weeks. #MasksSaveLives
1	There are rules & protocols in place for a reason. I am grateful for the scientists, doctors & other experts that are way smarter than me making these calls to stop the spread. I am happy to wear a mask if there’s any chance it will protect others. It’s that simple #WearADamnMask
1	They just closed my towns city hall indefinitely because an employee tested positive.  Adults can't figure out masks and social distancing.  But sure lets cram kids into buses and classrooms. #TrumpVirus2020 #WearADamnMask
1	This is ridiculous. I’m all for religion, just safe from my couch. As a San Diego women who got covid from a restaurant in Carlsbad. (Negative now). Wear a damn mask people, I almost died from this crap! #WearADamnMask
1	This pandemic, like any crisis, seems to squeeze the best and the worst of us out of the shadows. And he probably preaches about What Would Jesus Do. I’ll bet he’d wear a f**king mask.#COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
1	Victoria is again in lockdown due to the poor policies implemented by the State Govt for hotel quarantine handled by poorly trained security guards, ppl did not obey social distancing nor stay home to await test results. Masks are now MANDATORY. #auspol #Covid19 #WearADamnMask
1	Wearing masks during the pandemic is obviously a necessity, and those that aren't are just selfish or moronic. I wear a neck gaiter mask and it doesn't bother me at all, in fact it makes me feel better (probably due to my anxiety) - Am I alone in feeling that way? #WearADamnMask
1	What happens when we win the election and President Biden enacts a national mask mandate?  "Karens" will be coming out of the woodwork and it aint gonna be pretty.   How can we make this happen NOW?   #YesWeCanAgain #Biden2020Landslide #WearADamnMask
1	What's with the no mask thing? Do you really think life saving health laws are unconstitutional? Are you saying its okay for waiters to not wash their hands before handling your food? Get with it folks! Just WEAR THE DAMN MASK #Masks #MasksSaveLives
1	Where I live if you serve someone without a mask the business can be fined $9000 for each occurrence. So your $7 coffee & donut do not compensate the business for the risk of that loss. #WearADamnMask
1	Why not “Mask-Up Idaho” I was out there for the weekend and it was absolutely disgusting. I only saw 2 employees and maybe, MAYBE 20 people protecting those around them. #maskupidaho #WearADamnMask
1	YES, AGREE with above and also..... The UNITED STATES CITIZENS Deserve and Demanded testing so that they would know if they were sick to that could get treatment and PROTECT their loved ones and ALL AMERICANS. #WearADamnMask
1	Yesterday, a woman I passed in an enclosed area was wearing a mask with 45*’s name on the front. As much as I wanted to be irritated (knee jerk reaction nowadays), I secretly applauded her for putting common sense and safety first over politics (sort of). #WearADamnMask
1	You contracted it with the mask on, because other people aren’t wearing one. Your mask protects them from you. Masks only work if EVERYONE wears one! #WearADamnMask
1	You know whats more uncomfortable than a mask? A tube on your fucking gut. #WearTheDamnMask #WearADamnMask
1	anyone who doesn't comply with face coverings ect deserve to catch covid and end on a ventilator and die #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
1	multi-generational households are traditionally POC & taking it home to their grandmas & parents is the feature not the bug w/ this “@WhiteHouse plan” for this [corona]virus.  #DeliberateSpreaders seems obvious it’s why we’re STILL arguing abt masks. #WearADamnMask

2	And that’s what we’ve had for decades.... government schools that whitewashed history. #WearADamnMask
2	Bullshit! We are banned from going just about anywhere in the world because we are in the worst shape. Followed by Brasil thanks to their Trumpy Bear impersonator. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
2	Globally #COVID19 #SARSCoV2 has a CFR of 3.3. Influenza for 2019-202 had a CFR of 0.09. The Corona Virus is 36 times more fatal. #WearADamnMask
2	I am a multitasker. I will be voting Green to help them reach 5%, but I am 100% ready to put my vest and gas mask on, just been busy working nonstop as a nurse since Covid hit. Ugh. #WearADamnMask
2	I heard that this weekend. I told them the death certificate can't lie. It may list they died WITH covid, but doesn't say they died OF covid. Not sure I got anywhere, but I tried. #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
2	I'm staying home and working. Wish I was back home in New England; I'm trapped in Arizona between #COVID19 hot spots. #WearAMaskPlease
2	Is it just me or has the increase in mask wearing also caused a increase in fat young people? #NoMasks

0	Against the loss of civil liberties. Its a massive inconvenience and I won’t wear one. There is no evidence it does any good whatsoever.   I won’t put a mask on. I’m not entitled, selfish or a baby and certainly not a sheep. Stop being a sheep.#NoMasks
0	All masks are nasty, dirty, & dangerous. They actually spread germs, and are not protective. #MasksOff
0	Any one else notice how the people tut tutting at non mask wearers and pub goers, are the same ones who in ordinary times wouldn't know a good time if it bit them on the bum. You know the sorts, you usually see them sporting high viz vests at the village fete. #NoMasks
0	Before the 24th I hadn't seen 1 mask or gloves on ANY supermarket staff for the last 3 months.  Same with police, even while scooping drunks off the street, they stopped wearing the masks months ago.  I've not heard of any 'cases' here up north. #NoMask

1	@StopandShop Hey there..“No Mask No Service” is not being enforced in your Hempstead trpk and Wantaugh ave location. Have to stare down folks with a chinstraps every turn I make. I care about my senior mother that I take food shopping! This is pitiful! #StopAndShop #NoMasks
1	@barnardfox5dc #gooddaydc  if you were worried about covid-19, you would have on a mask and not get in his face smh #WearADamnMask
1	All you snowflake republicans, wear a fucking mask. #WearAMask #wearafuckingmask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskPlease
1	Also I’m sure since you are refusing masks, you will refuse any vaccine that comes out. I would also appreciate it if you stay the “f” away from me, my family and friends #COVID19AB #WearADamnMask
1	And evidently today according to our "leader", there is a decline. Lies, lies, lies. No testing over weekend so of course the numbers are down. I don't need a math degree to figure that out. But #DeathSantis got pat on back for job well done #WearADamnMask
1	At this point I will happily take a couple of months of martial law just so that at the end of it I can get back to my fucking life! WEAR YOUR MASK PEOPLE AND PUT IT OVER YOUR GOD DAMN NOSE! I hate this fucking city #Nashville #COVIDIOT #coronavirus #WearADamnMask
1	Covid-19 cases rise so highly meanwhile the people awareness of Covid-19 has been rapidly going down at the low level. Whenever I went outside, I saw most people didn't wear mask. That also indicate how people stupidity is rapidly going up at the high level #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	DO NOT REOPEN SCHOOLS!! #DoNotReopenSchools #ProtectStudents #KeepUsSafe #COVID19 #MaskUp #WearADamnMask
1	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV & only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin. #WearADamnMask
1	Don't recommend going to Bottles and Stuff on Newburgh and 5 Mile. They're not enforcing/following the mask ordinance.  #Maskholes #WearADamnMask
1	Gee it's almost as if the MLB's plan to safeguard players, coaches and officials from a highly contagious and deadly virus with no cure isn't actually working. #COVIDIOTS #TrumpVirus #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
1	Good for them! So tired of reading constant stories of those who refuse to abide by mask mandates. Equally tired of abuse workers are facing to try to enforce them.  #WearADamnMask
1	Good morning! Wear a mask when not at home, keep a minimum distance of 6 feet as best you can, and wash your hands frequently throughout the day. #WearADamnMask
1	He's so spot on. I'm so deeply sorry for the family.  My deepest condolences. No one is wearing a mask here in Georgia.  Gas station me and the guy behind the counter.  15 others no mask. #WearADamnMask
1	Hey Team KC, y’all better put those Team Kelly masks up for sale!!!  #WearADamnMask
1	Hey folks, if you wear a mask I think: She has her reasons. So if I don't wear a mask, you think: She has her reasons.  It's called respect. If we're divided, we're all in trouble.  #MaskUp #NoMasks
1	How are these #COVIDIOTS still alive. They are crowded in a room with no masks. I’m shocked that the press are not wearing masks. Shameful! #WearADamnMask
1	I bet if we went around telling anti-maskers that there was a gay gene spreading through #Covid_19 they’d wear their masks. #WearADamnMask
1	I don't get why there r folks so against #Masks? China manage to eliminate #COVID19 bc of its strict on masks and isolation. Continue mask-free and going out when issued with stay home notices. And your city/state can nvr end #COVID 1/2 #MasksDontWork #MasksSaveLives
1	I just saw a tweet that said something like “I don’t want to wear a mask cause then it’ll be normalized.”   If you don’t wear a mask NOW, it WILL become normalized and become part of every day life even after this. So wear it now, so we don’t have to later. #WearADamnMask
1	I suppose there's a chance #FragileDonnie hasn't hit refresh since April. His staff probably found a good poll and made it his screensaver. #TrumpVirus #WeakPresident #WearADamnMask
1	I was thinking the subway was safe a month ago but today so many people had their masks pulled down and no one enforces correctly wearing a mask. #WearADamnMask
1	I will be doing more shopping in Calgary after today, Home Depot at the Country Hills was full of people wearing masks, everyone was wearing a masks in their cars they were travelling between destinations, no shopping in Okotoks or Airdrie until they figure it out!#WearADamnMask

1	I'm so sorry for your loss, prayers and condolences go out to you & your family I lost my cousin to covid-19 day before yesterday, so I understand. People are dying as result of other people not wearing a mask. This is not a joke/hoax!!!! #WearADamnMask
1	If I hear one more man wine about their mask being too tight behind their ears, Ima lose my mind. No pantyhose have EVER been anything other than too tight E.V.E.R.Y.W.H.E.R.E #WearADamnMask
1	If YOU STUPID#MAGA MORONS had worn masks since March like the rest of us did, the #COVID19 virus would no longer be spreading EXPONENTIALLY (look it up) and our schools COULD REOPEN and economy would be well into recovery - like the REST of the WORLD!#WearADamnMask
1	If you can't get people to believe they need to wear a mask, how will you convince them they need to get a vaccine? Asking for a friend... #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife

1	If you don’t wear a mask you ugly. #WearADamnMask
1	Im still waiting to hear a real and truthful example of anyone who’s “medically exempt” from wearing a mask. Like prove me wrong but if ya have a heath condition surely getting the virus is hella worse than being a bit uncomfortable no? #WearAMaskPlease
1	It just occurred to me that since we will still be wearing face masks in the winter my nose will actually be warm. #WearADamnMask
1	It needs to stop. If this is a thing you believe, it's YOU that's currently causing the most harm. Shut the fuck up, sit down, wear a mask and stop spreading your moist bullshit. I don't want to die because you're a fucking idiot.   #COVID19AB #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	It's mind boggling to me the number of people that still aren't wearing masks/wearing masks correctly. Georgia is nowhere close to flattening the curve. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I’m so sorry for your loss. My whole family wears masks, even my adult daughter who has cerebral palsy and severe intellectual disabilities. She knows how important it is!! #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I’m so sorry. Why is wearing a mask so hard? #WearADamnMask
1	Judge Pirro paid too much money on PLASTIC SURGERY to have her extremely stretched faced hidden behind a mask.  #MasksSaveLives #WearADamnMask
1	Just went to the gas station. The only person other than me wearing a mask was the cashier who was actually in a booth behind glass. I don't get it. The indifference is startling here. #WearADamnMask
1	Let’s agree that if you choose NOT to wear a mask in general public settings, then you forfeit any health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage and medical services by the front line workers the moment you COVID positive. Sign here.. #publichealth #COVID19 #insurance #NoMasks
1	Let’s get something straight: no one is comfortable wearing a mask. I don’t wake up every morning excited to cover my face, but I do it anyways b/c it’s the right thing to do for myself and those around me. Just get with it already....#COVID19 #WearADamnMask
1	Many people, including a massive number of idiots in Yakima County did not (and many still don’t) wear masks when advised and then mandated. Many others are only doing it halfway...as in not covering nose and mouth. Bottom line: #WearADamnMask
1	Masks in public places are a necessary prevention tool. You DON'T need to have symptoms to be infected. Many people get Covid and never experience symptoms- They're known as silent Carriers, who are indeed, Spreading the virus.#WearADamnMask
1	Masks look to be part of our lives for some time to come, so it's more economical (and eco-friendly) to buy one or two cloth masks that you can wash and wear again. They're widely available (look online) and come in a huge range of patterns and colours. #WearAMaskPlease
1	No need to be patient. Not wearing a mask in public (as mandated by PA Governor) is the equivalent of swinging around a gun with the safety off; somebody’s going to get hurt. That said, I see Philadelphia P/O watch people walk around w/o masks and they say nada! #WearADamnMask
1	Not only did everyone in the church wear a mask ALL THREE PRESIDENTS in attendance wore masks too #WearADamnMask
1	Ooh I get so angry when I wear a mask in 90 degree heat on a run and I run past others who cannot be bothered. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
1	Over 155,000 Americans have succumbed to Covid-19 and too many more will.  Your right to not wear a mask is disrespectful to all front line workers and your fellow citizens.   Your right to not wear a mask contributes to our country’s horrific toll.  #WearAMaskSaveALife

1	So the foxtrot uniform charlie kilo at least I'm wearing a MF mask. I have plenty. Worry about your germ spreading President who has no respect for the health of others. At least I respect my fellow American by wearing a mask. Do you? Good bye #WearADamnMask
1	So they're willing to incur legal fees a fine, and an eventual loss of business. Cool cool. Close the joint.   #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
1	Social Distance. Stay home. Don’t open the economy too soon. Wear a mask: The plans that we do have are based on science and they work, no thanks to ignoramus-in-chief. #SocialDistancing #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	TL/DR:  1. Consistent & correct wearing of masks 2. Avoid crowds & keep a distance of 6+ ft  3. Stay away from crowded places 4. Be outdoors rather than indoors 5. Wash your hands. Use sanitizer if you can't wash. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife

1	Watching idiot parents coming to pick their kids up from Camp Covid… Some poor counselor is having to take temperature checks as they drive up, and these stupid parents still aren’t wearing masks! No wonder! #WearADamnMask
1	Watching the willingness of #Iranian Women, of the #bbcpersian #VOA elite/class, i can see it is #Islamophobia which drives their “No Hejab” calls for #Iran. #HumanRights has nothing to do with it, otherwise they would refuse masks more so. #Hypocrites are #parasites. #NoMasks

1	What if, stay with me on this, the mask wasn't an affront to his freedom, but a statement about his compassion for others.  Also, he's f***ing idiot and we'd appreciate it if people like him didn't wrap their ignorance in our flag. #WearADamnMask

1	Yes... right! @Adrieliam is judging and shaming people who don't wear masks because it endangers his health. Exactly! Now Ms Karen Larp... Was that so hard?  Go reward yourself with some cake! #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	You know the whole point of a mask mandate is to WEAR the mask? NOT put it on your ear and let it hang or leave it by your water bottle or not wear it at all. #WearADamnMask
1	You see it's because of populistic morons like yourself that we have trouble getting this virus under control!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Your "logic" is typical of the uneducated. Just because THEY didn't die doesn't mean other people won't or won't have life long effects. You really are willing to sacrifice them #COVIDIOTS You probably don't even get the flu shot. Bunch of nutcases you all are #WearADamnMask
1	Your running won’t affect my weight. Your mask wearing will affect my health. If you haven’t figured that out, you’re an idiot. If you have figured it out, you’re incredibly selfish. I run to protect my health. I wear a mask to protect others. Get over yourself. #WearADamnMask
1	Y’all, wearing a mask is great. I can mouth the words to the weird song I have in my head and no one looks at me funny. #WearADamnMask
1	and yet @DrBonnieHenry @CDCofBC still not a fan of requiring masks. It doesn't make sense. Even Trump and Pence have been wearing and promoting them and that's the bottom of the intellectual barrel! #MasksSaveLives
1	noah fence but if i can wear a mask outside for 4 and 1/2 hours in the morning then 3 hours during the afternoon in the southern heat for band camp then u can wear a mask to the store <3  #WearAMaskPlease
1	— frickin’ idea what they’re talking about and how people like her are part of the problem. Sure, masks aren’t the cure for #COVID19 . But it certainly helps in being a preventative from the spread of the virus. So, again, #WearAMaskPlease. #WearAMaskSaveALife

2	What if we let schools open with only teachers under 40? The death rate would be comparable to other school year viruses we were comfortable with last year. Teachers over 40 can sabatical, and we could get some great new young teachers in the system! #WeWontDieforDOE #nomasks

1	As my friend @LaurenEMorrill says, "I don't know how to explain to you that you should care about other people." This pandemic is ravaging our country, specifically Black and brown communities and the Navajo Nation. Stay home, wear a mask, and save lives. #WearADamnMask
1	As the virus continues to spread uncontrollably, nearly half the riders in my #metra car today don't have masks. Mandates from the govt and promises from the agency do no good if conductors don't remind riders that masks are required and hand them out as needed. #WearADamnMask
1	At first I thought the most ridiculous reaction to COVID19 was people panic buying toilet paper... I now see it’s the refusal to wear a mask at the grocery store.   #WearADamnMask
1	Covid cases are coming down. What we need is someone who can lead us out of this madness. Trump is not ever gonna be the mask guy. On the other hand, if people see their kids back in school, and can go outside without fear and mask harassment, I think he has a shot. #NoMasks
1	Dear Senator, thank you for all you do to represent Oregon. Hair clippers are fairly inexpensive and easy to use. Or next time you’re in the valley, I’ll even trim your hair, mask and all. And as an educator I have practiced social distancing all summer.    #WearAMaskPlease
