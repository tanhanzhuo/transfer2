1	The man who slept with #pornstars w/o using a condom is telling physicians what they "need" for protection?  Irony anyone?  #PPE #COVID19 #ventilators #pandemic #N95masks #HealthCareWorkers #covid19us #masks
0	WA St’s gov  has issued a mandate that we have to be masked -I wish he added costumes. If I have to see the world walk by me in masks & social distance, I would like the world to walk by me in costume w| their character’s signature walk. I think the world needs that. #masks
0	By wearing a facemask, what you are really saying is I'm a gullible twat! Just say no! #NoMasks
0	@ClarkeMicah   Great article in the DM this morning. The most realistic and truthful assessment of this ‘mess’ so far. Good job! Masks are unhealthy, unproven & unnecessary. The only reason for masks is to differentiate who is scared witless and who is not. #NoMasks
0	@foxandfriends what a shit network!  Trump says there’s a time and a place for masks!  Huge difference between a hospital and your local business.  Propaganda!  #NoMasks
0	Ice cream shop (walk up only) wouldn’t serve me due to no mask so I went to another place and went through a drive through. So FU ice cream business.  I was standing around people eating with no mask and hanging out. #NoMaskOnMe #MasksareforSheep #MasksOffAmerica
0	How old are you?? Violence over a #useless #mask?? Grow up. #karma sure is a bitch! #MasksOffAmerica #BurnYourMask #masksdontwork
0	It's not about masks or AC. It's about control and compliance. How far can they push until we push back. It's all a test to see how easily we can be converted to communism.   Wake up! #Trump2020Landslide #NoMasks
0	The Left is super supportive of rape survivors when they choose an abortion but calls them “selfish bastards” when they can’t wear masks due to trauma. Keep it up Dems. #VoteDemsOut #RedWave2020 #NoMaskMandates #MyBodyMyChoice #masksdontwork
0	They need us to be their scapegoat for new outbreaks. Like seat belts they must make wearing masks mandatory to protect the ignorant from themselves.  #MasksSaveLives
1	@BBCNews 1. You are reporting 78% uptake on masks in many EU countries and 21% here while Brits stay at home to afraid to go out. Could the reason for this be the lack of mask wearing itself? I know its why I won't go out! #WearAMask
1	A mask under your nose is not a mask. A mask under your chin is not a mask. Walking into the business & THEN putting on your mask is not a mask. Taking your mask off to eat or drink in public is not a mask. Taking your mask off to talk on the phone is not a mask. #MasksSaveLives
1	Japanese people are wearing masks. They have only about 1000 deaths due to COVID19 as a result.   #WearAMask
1	Me And EVERY ONE IF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY all over the country  We're staying put as much as possible #StaySafe #StayAtHome #StayAtHomeSaveLives #StaySafeStayHealthy #MaskUp #WearYourMaskFL #WearAMask
1	The fact that anti-masking is a thing is a completely terrifying insight into  the nature of some beings who look, walk and breathe just like us. #WearAMask
1	There is no such thing as "Anti-mask Activists." However there are far too many "Self-centered Science Deniers." #Masks4All

2	Covid idiots #WearAMask
2	I live in NYC, I can assure you Covid 19 is quite real. As I watch it rise across the country, I blame people like you for spewing absolute lies and gaslighting. Trump made this political instead stepping up and leading the entire country through this health crisis. #WearAMask
2	In NY, when we hit 10,000 cases, we shut down.  When Florida hits 10,000 cases, they open up Disney World.  #COVID19 #WearAMask
2	It’s hard on the front lines to watch the choices of the population affect our most medically vulnerable.  Please #WearAMask
2	Yes they do!!! #WearAMask
2	Y’all remember how stressful @jjabrams #LOST was?    It’s like a lovely vacation / get away from all we’re going through.  Ain’t nothing like a pandemic to make the black smoke monster look like a bbq back draft.    #perspective #WearAMask
0	As a socialist, masks are the ultimate tribute to our final goals. Once people stop seeing each other as individuals, and realize we are only as important as the groups we identify with, only then will we reach true socialism. #WearAMask
0	ALL OF IT.... You asked for that.!! #Plandemic #fakepandemic #NoMasks
0	I think forcing children to wear masks In school will be the line. There are more people against that than there were for the masks in shops. I just wished all the groups against this tyranny would join forces. It is a united cause. #KeepBritainFree #KeepIrelandFree #NoMasks
0	My son’s friend had Covid and wore a mask  all the time! #masksdontwork
0	That's terrible! I hope your state legislature stops the mask mandate from becoming a law. Masks are bad!  Everyday this awful dream is still a reality...2020 is such a wasted year.  #FakePandemic #CovidHoax #NoMasks
0	ppl with low immunity are dying. They'd likely die of influenza as well. Masks lower ur immunity. U inhale 02 (oxygen) and exhale CO2. What happens to the CO2 around ur mask? U just breathe it back in again increasing ur level of C02. This will lead to more sick ppl! #NoMasks
1	I'm thinking about making some shirts that say "I self identify as a mask-wearer. Please don't shame me as it might be triggering" to wear in stores. #NoMasks
2	What a dipshit question! Aren’t the 2 symptomatic people in your ridiculous scenario the irresponsible ones here? Why aren’t THEY self isolating? #idiots #coronahoax #plandemic #ridiculous #sheep #baa #nomasks
0	Ooh, this issue has me conflicted; yes, masks for kids are abhorrent, but profiting from the stupid is so tempting... ultimately, i guess my moral compass would force me to do the right thing and boycott them though. A fool and his money... #idiots #nomasks
0	The whole way Boris has handled this pandemic. Trashed the economy and killed thousands of businesses for something no worse than the flu and now masks! Don’t get me started #NoMasks
0	Just popped to a couple of local shops so showed them the respect of wearing a muzzle for the first time.  It was really horrible and didn’t take long before I was feeling short of breath. How have you lot been putting up with this? #masks #NoMasks

1	Saw a young kid (about 10/11) walking in a shop with his mum, masked up, his black mask looked about 20 times too big for him so all he did was fiddle with it. I'm almost a week into no shopping.  #NoMasks
2	@realDonaldTrump #HCQW0RKS Provide Americans treatment & hope! We demand the opportunity to have open discussions with or trusted physicians about prevention and treatment. #COVID19 #NoMaskOnMe
2	Given that the govt has an established track-record of  measures which push large sections of the population into precarity, would it not make sense to question whether lockdown is a continuation of this pernicious theme? Deafening silence from the left, IMO! #Plandemic #NoMasks
0	I lived for 59 years and never had to wear a mask in public, until the woke, participation trophy crowd came of age.  If you’re too afraid to live life, don’t ruin life for the rest of us. Stay at home. #MasksOffAmerica
1	@BorisJohnson have a word with the service stations and services on the motorways people walking round with no masks  Shell are the worst #NoMask
1	@dmgbnagar  Only 50%people in gautam bhuddha nagar are found wearing mask.. Sheer negligence. Why isnt there strict impose of mask wearing law? #negligence #NoMasks
2	Maybe the 30M unemployed need to get their jobs back instead of a hand out. I know people who r getting unemployment who never had jobs!!! @POTUS #OpenAmerica #NoMasks

0	@nbcsandiego What is the size of a #ChinaVirus particle? What is the smallest sized particle that can be filtered by ANY of the masks being worn in San Diego? Is that on your Mask Do’s and Don’ts website? You’re either ignorant or lying shills. Disgraceful either way. #NoMasks
0	Because my visor at work gave me such a headache i tried a mask. Today i woke up with my glands enlarged & a sore throat.... not worn any of this shit in 4 months, perfectly well! #NoMasks

1	 And leprechauns steal cereal. Everything you wrote is magnificently stupid. Even Pres T has finally admitted the truth. In FL on Fri he said, "The single best way to defeat the disease is... wear a mask"... Doh! Your leader has abandoned you!  #MasksSaveLives
1	#HowISolveAProblem In the #Coronavirus Pandemic  I #WearAMask and stay the HELL away from the morons that don't #WearADamnMask
1	Am I the only one who doesn’t get all these protests against wearing a mask?? How many more people are going to lose their loved ones and their jobs because of other people selfishness?? #WearADamnMask
1	Exactly. This is why I have no sympathy for anti-maskers who get COVID and die. They are selfish assholes that don’t understand or care about simple science. Your mask doesn’t protect you, it protects me, and my mask protects you. #WearADamnMask
1	Found out a friend of mine, who lives in a very rural area, who also refused to wear a mask and distance - is now in the hospital with #covid. They are doing ok so far, but it’s obviously not just the sniffles. #WearADamnMask
1	Hey @Target on Madison Avenue why are you not enforcing the mask mandate? Most of the people in the store today were not wearing them. I'm a frequent shopper but now I've grounded myself from in-store shopping. DO BETTER. #WearADamnMask
1	I am sick to death of you selfish fuckers openly defying store policy and walking around with no mask and daring  someone to challenge you. To the teen whose father dragged her into his narcissism, I apologize for my language. But fuck you too. #WearADamnMask
1	I was just going to say.  Repubs this week tried to blame protests for Covid increases, but there are still protests in NYC, and other events, and our numbers are still low despite it all.  The difference ...MASKS.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Spent some time over in England (specifically Derbyshire) for a week. I've a few observations. 1.) From what I saw, mask use in pretty much ubiquitous. 2.) Going into shops is logical, organised and polite. 3.) Coming back to Wales, hardly ANY people wear masks. Scary. #MasksOn
1	The #TrumpVirus continues to spread … and you want to send CHILDREN to school! SICK BASTARD!! #WearADamnMask
1	The plot twist in the Covid story might be that kids wear masks better than adults!  I’ve seen lots of chin protectors lately on grown-ups. #CoverYourFace
1	Until the guys standing behind you wear a mask all the time your words are meaningless. @VP @POTUS How hard is it? #WearADamnMask
1	Went to the gas station yesterday and I was the only one wearing a mask. Did I cough as I put my beer on the counter? Yes. But I resisted the urge to say “Is the kitchen closed tonight? It usually smells like cooking food in here.” So not a complete bitch right? #WearADamnMask
2	Has anyone else noticed @THEHermanCain's silence when it comes to #FragileDonnie's handling of COVID-19? Especially the claims of the effectiveness hydrochloroquine? Why is he so silent? Oh yeah, @realDonaldTrump killed him. #TrumpVirus #WeakPresident #WearADamnMask

2	that $600 a month is going back into the economy ~ the millions being gifted to big business with no oversight is the problem.                        45 needs to get his head out of his ass & realize #COVID19 isn’t going away until it’s spread can be stopped  #WearADamnMask

0	Karen says your children are not safe at home!   Fight Mask Tyranny! #NoMasks
1	@JudgeJeanine the biggest subliminal message is “I’m smart so I wear a mask”. People refusing a mask, the subliminal message is “I’m an idiotic Trump cult member and want to die for the cause”. #WearADamnMask
1	@dunkindonuts Stowe, VT- As an almost daily customer I am so frustrated that your staff and your organization are not taking @GovPeterShumlin mandates for mask wearing seriously. #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	Are you a doctor?  Have you spent your life studying infectious diseases?   Know any of the 150,000 dead from Covid?  STFU about masks and stop flaunting your ignorance.  #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	As per our beloved PM we needed 21 days to win against COVID-19 , I am still waiting for those 21 days to get over or it has become synonym of 'Acche Din' , till then #StayHomeStaySafe #CoverYourFace
1	Don't give in to the government attempt to control you!   Stop covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough!   Protect your freedom!  The government are controlling us. Where's the evidence NOT sneezing and coughing on people ACTUALLY saves lives.  #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
1	I don’t give a damn. But I still wear a mask because I’m selfish bastard. #WearADamnMask

1	Much as I would like to show my appreciation for all these brave souls who seem prepared to take a #coronavirus bullet for me, because the ‘arn’t afraid of the virus/flu’ think it’s a ‘plandemic’, ‘scamdemic’ or your just macho, you continue to spread it morons so #WearADamnMask
1	NO! The rules are the rules...No mask...find another way to your destination. #WearADamnMask
1	No Shoes No Shirt No Service   wearing a mask is optional  Crazy Policy  in reality it’s called killing your customers!  #MaskUpAmerica #MaskUpMA #Masks #MasksSaveLives
1	PSA:   Your mask should cover your nose. Otherwise, it does nothing to protect anyone.  #WearADamnMask #CoverYourFace #CoverYourFace
1	The people who refuse to wear a mask (aka Cult 45) are truly ignorant and selfish. It’s not even debatable because it’s insanely simple, yet these folks think their “rights” are more important than anyone else’s. Classic trump mentality. #WearADamnMask
1	They don’t want to know. Or they know and are just lying. Because they’d rather wear a ventilator than a mask.  Or more likely, they just don’t give a rat’s ass if you or I or someone we love has to wear a ventilator because of them.  #WearADamnMask
1	Where can we get the Canucks logo masks? #WearADamnMask
1	You have captured my high school students perfectly. What would elementary students look like? #WearAMask #MasksSaveLives
1	You should wear a mask. Not just because of Covid, but cause you ugly. #WearADamnMask
1	‘Clowns’ trying to help prevent spread of a serious infection, and if ur seeing them they’ll be protecting u. Hardly something to ridicule people for. We need look after each other and masks are one part of this #WearAMaskPlease

1	Neighbor who refused to wear a mask has covid and didn’t tell anyone until 12 days into symptoms and a positive test...”flames on the side of my face”... #WearAMaskPlease
1	No, what they need to do is GTFO, scrub any thoughts of trying to play sports during a global pandemic of a deadly & highly contagious virus with no cure, & do their part to prevent its spread. You know, the OPPOSITE of what they're doing. #COVIDIOTS #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
