FAVOR	@RuekaA @cher I know the literature says children 10 -19 are at most risk. but with this novel virus, everyone is at risk. That's why masks are important for adults. they can't go around spreading this to everyone thinking children are immune. One life is one life too many.
FAVOR	@hoaghealth Your own doctor, Dr. Jeff Barke, is now infamous for not wearing a mask and telling anyone who will listen to his numerous media statements to also not wear a mask. Why does he still have privileges at Hoag? #NewportBeach #HuntingtonBeach #Coronavirus

FAVOR	@DrEricDing I flew a few days ago. It was made crystal clear masks are be worn AT ALL TIMES in airport and on plane. Before we boarded @SouthwestAir nicely announced 'don't even think about not complying or you won't be flying'. To have the privelage to fly we must comply.
FAVOR	I’m noticing it’s mostly the childless crowd who are anti-mask. Maybe that attitude and the fact you’re childless are related? Stop being selfish. #TuesdayThoughtNuggets
FAVOR	@FitzTrubey @ajc @CherokeeSchools start Aug 3 with masks merely “encouraged”. Irresponsible &amp; reckless to the staff, teachers, students &amp; all their families. Social distancing in middle/high schools is not even practical in classrooms or hallways. #ScienceMatters #FactsMatter

FAVOR	@JenniferJokes @rocko470033 @parkhurstcards Masks help to reduce viral load. You still might get Covid but you won’t get severely sick. Countries (eg: :flag_for_Slovakia: , :flag_for_Japan: etc) with mandatory mask wearing report new cases but look at their number of deaths-very low. If we’re smart, we won’t need lockdowns. 
FAVOR	@GOPLeader Republicans are refusing to wear masks. Coronavirus doesn’t care about politics, how wealthy you are or who you chose to pray to.  Kev, when are you going to demand that fvckwit in our Oval Office gets off the golf course &amp; comes up with a plan?  #TrumpHasNoPlan

FAVOR	For anyone claiming that fear is the killer and not covid: fear is an incentive for self preservation. Fear for others creates responsibility. It doesn’t have to be negative. It also helps you be a mask wearing informed human.  So yes I am afraid.   #COVIDIOTS

FAVOR	@LeChatNoire4 My friend, who is immune compromised, went into a Publix today. Publix stores in FL have a mask mandate. Shoppers wear a mask to get in &amp; then many remove them. She was accosted today by an anti-mask person. I don't know what the answer is but this has to stop.
FAVOR	Not wearing a mask has replaced confederate flag shirts as the ultimate indicator of white trash.

FAVOR	@WCheesemaker @StephenKing No. You’re missing the point. And from the way I phrased my statement I can understand why. I was attempting to point out masks work! They help stop the spread of disease. I should have stated it more clearly. I’m a scientist &amp; a big fan of masks- and science!! :relaxed: 
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump The only Virus in the United States of America is #COVID19 also known as the #TrumpVirus named after the idiot that couldn't lead his way out of a brown paper bag, much less a country through a #pandemic  Why? Because he's a #COVIDIOT that's why.
FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln I just said you must have masks. Some can say Lincoln Project, perhaps Wear A Damn Mask. They will fly off the shelves. #LincolnProject
FAVOR	@cleverkate I have been wondering what is the right approach. By saying nothing you are in turn approving a behavior. I was @Costco and a mom w/ a child and husband (both w/ masks on) wasn't wearing one. I politely said they have them for free when you come in. She was not amused
FAVOR	@TVNewsHQ @JesseBWatters Yes I have, but you don't see much of it because understand stay at home and social distancing.  Instead of no mask shouting in each others face.    Just saying

FAVOR	I was talking to my 4 year old about why wearing a mask is important. She replied “But I like my mask. I don’t even mind wearing it.”  This from a kid with sensory issues who has refused to even wear any shirts facing forward for the past 6 months. #medtwitterkids

FAVOR	@ChrisWickNews A virus is much smaller than shown.  How-ev-er, a virus needs water to survive. The virus rides on airbourne water mist from a cough. Each drop is about 150 to 800 microns.   It would not pass through the mesh of the mask, no matter how dense your intelligence.
FAVOR	@naijagyaldee Didnt even have his mask covering his whole mouth and then grabs it and pulls it down part way thru ... once he touches it games over it's not sterile anymore. And the beard don't help either dude!!
FAVOR	Yesterday the #LAPD gave out 300 masks in Hollywood. I am embarrassed to live in this City, a place where infections, hospitalizations &amp; deaths continue to rise &amp; 300 people felt that it was ok to leave home without a masks. It’s the City of idiots not ANGELES.

AGAINST	@Jacob_Resnick Good on you @You_Found_Nimmo masks do not work and are just a form of control and a sign of subservience .
AGAINST	@Hank_licious @realjuliasong @BMcAdory9 I've been saying that all along. If the masks work then let those that want to wear them wear them and those of us who want to be free not wear. It's a free country. Or at least it was.
AGAINST	My wife and I were not allowed to work as they say we now have to wear a mask. When told we are exempt they said we need letter from doctor to prove it. Rang doctor's and they say they will not give us a letter or refer us privately for one. #KBF
AGAINST	@RepTedDeutch Instead of trying to order us around, help the hospitals, help the healthcare workers, and We The People can assess the risk ourselves whether to close a business or wear a face mask. More gov destroys everything #VoteRedToSaveAmerica

AGAINST	We will NOT wear masks. #MasksOff
AGAINST	@Michael_Rowan9 @ICMdoc @lyndsay_hopkins @ShippersUnbound Hot spots? Travelled through the NW &amp; no piles of bodies. It's political chicanery to keep the fear narrative. (Unreliably) test a bit more to get some extra cases, hey presto, a hot spot. The gov wants us all docile &amp; compliant ready for the saviour vaccine. #KBF
AGAINST	Anyone else find it suspect that Walmart sold masks and then announced they were requiring "facial coverings". Now my local store isn't selling them. Extra money for Walmart by preying on your media-induced fear. They knew masks didn't work, but they took your money.
AGAINST	@fliss1977 @dockaurG The idea is to create a new generation of even more ignorant people. Easier to control and manipulate by the fewer. I can't believe how easy is to brainwash people. Schools need to reopen normally!

AGAINST	The hassle and pointless wearing of masks has pushed us to online shopping with Ocado.
AGAINST	@randyhillier @mayoushtak The real only option is to stop this farse and send our kids back to school normally. I will refuse to send kids back if masks will be mandatory even just in corridors, how dumb! I hope many families would join in together! They can wear a mask on Oct 31 for Halloween!
AGAINST	@WeAreTheMillies Employees shouldn't have to be enforcing masks.

AGAINST	@Kingdom49867884 @scratchhere Same! I have gone to my local Walmart, Grocery. CVS and Walgreens this whole time without one! I am definitely the only one most days! One time was told I need a mask but just walked past them... more ppl need to just say

AGAINST	@WeAreCanProud This goes beyond any logic. So if In 3, 4,5 maybe 6 months there have been no new cases anywhere they still think we should be doing this crap. Wake up people, there is more going on here. If they would only commit to thresholds I would trust them more. #FakePandemic
AGAINST	@GregAbbott_TX Guess you should have done something to stop the #riots and “protests”. But instead you were part of the problem attending the Floyd funeral. #fakepandemic #opentexas
AGAINST	@ConHome @MattHancock Just stop this. Release new death stats ‘from’ COVID-19 to correct the ‘misleading’ #PHE figures. Barely any hospital admissions/deaths. NHS has spare capacity. No evidence to support mask wearing.  This virus is of no danger to vast majority of people #EndLockdown
