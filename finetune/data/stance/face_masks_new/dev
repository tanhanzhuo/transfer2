FAVOR	Spent some time over in England (specifically Derbyshire) for a week. I've a few observations. 1.) From what I saw, mask use in pretty much ubiquitous. 2.) Going into shops is logical, organised and polite. 3.) Coming back to Wales, hardly ANY people wear masks. Scary.
FAVOR	@CAgovernor A mask under your nose is not a mask. A mask under your chin is not a mask. Walking into the business &amp; THEN putting on your mask is not a mask. Taking your mask off to eat or drink in public is not a mask. Taking your mask off to talk on the phone is not a mask.

FAVOR	@aamirkhanbcba @roccogalatilaw “Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently.

FAVOR	@kmjensen05 @KathyBoren @KMH_Music @JodieHMoss @GOPLeader They don’t want to know. Or they know and are just lying. Because they’d rather wear a ventilator than a mask.  Or more likely, they just don’t give a rat’s ass if you or I or someone we love has to wear a ventilator because of them.
FAVOR	Work from home should really just become the norm this year.  At work people dont wear masks or maintain social distance and the urge to throw a tantrum and swearing at such #COVIDIOTS is making me crazy.
FAVOR	@BorisJohnson have a word with the service stations and services on the motorways people walking round with no masks  Shell are the worst
FAVOR	@BBCNews 1. You are reporting 78% uptake on masks in many EU countries and 21% here while Brits stay at home to afraid to go out. Could the reason for this be the lack of mask wearing itself? I know its why I won't go out!
FAVOR	Listening to #3Guys and you know #COVID sucks when @mlogan31 says the pain was worse than any other surgeries or anything from his storied college and #NFL career.  I knew it wasn’t, but damn it’s no joke people. #COVID19
FAVOR	And all of this is over not wearing a damn mask to buy 2 cigars?!?! Yes this pandemic is tough for all of us, and it sucks when a parent loses custody of their child, but that’s not how you handle it. There are odd, tough jobs you can still get hired on even today.

FAVOR	@kenyadad12 The people who refuse to wear a mask (aka Cult 45) are truly ignorant and selfish. It’s not even debatable because it’s insanely simple, yet these folks think their “rights” are more important than anyone else’s. Classic trump mentality.
FAVOR	@dunkindonuts Stowe, VT- As an almost daily customer I am so frustrated that your staff and your organization are not taking @GovPeterShumlin mandates for mask wearing seriously.
FAVOR	There is no such thing as "Anti-mask Activists." However there are far too many "Self-centered Science Deniers." 
FAVOR	Neighbor who refused to wear a mask has covid and didn’t tell anyone until 12 days into symptoms and a positive test...”flames on the side of my face”...
FAVOR	@LaVeterinarian @NeilClark66 Exactly. This is why I have no sympathy for anti-maskers who get COVID and die. They are selfish assholes that don’t understand or care about simple science. Your mask doesn’t protect you, it protects me, and my mask protects you.
FAVOR	@LynnDuncalf Good work:mask:
FAVOR	Hey @Target on Madison Avenue why are you not enforcing the mask mandate? Most of the people in the store today were not wearing them. I'm a frequent shopper but now I've grounded myself from in-store shopping. DO BETTER.
FAVOR	@Canucks Where can we get the Canucks logo masks?
FAVOR	@mr_squeege Saw a young kid (about 10/11) walking in a shop with his mum, masked up, his black mask looked about 20 times too big for him so all he did was fiddle with it. I'm almost a week into no shopping. :blush:
FAVOR	To those who walk down the street not wearing a mask because you are smoking and blowing that shit in everyone’s faces. Get in the bin you turd. #COVID19au #WearAMask
FAVOR	@GoAngelo @JudgeJeanine the biggest subliminal message is “I’m smart so I wear a mask”. People refusing a mask, the subliminal message is “I’m an idiotic Trump cult member and want to die for the cause”.
FAVOR	@neverquitcigs @TomDangora If you can't breath in a mask! Then you will die from Covid.  Just saying.  Stay the F^^k home and maybe you should drive without seat belts, not turn off your phones during take off and landings, god forbid those pesky tray tables!! Drink some wine and drive.

AGAINST	Went into morrisons, no mask not even for heading to door. No one of any significance gave a sh*t. Yes it's pot luck, but if you do get challenged remain calm but stand your ground, if you get overly defensive it may look as if you're trying to be confrontational

AGAINST	@EddyGriffin14 @KristaMHilton It's not about masks or AC. It's about control and compliance. How far can they push until we push back. It's all a test to see how easily we can be converted to communism.   Wake up! #Trump2020Landslide  
AGAINST	@ClarkeMicah   Great article in the DM this morning. The most realistic and truthful assessment of this ‘mess’ so far. Good job! Masks are unhealthy, unproven &amp; unnecessary. The only reason for masks is to differentiate who is scared witless and who is not.

AGAINST	@jmclean514 @GMB I’m not wearing one ! A homemade rag or a £3 fashion mask will protect you ! BS they cause more harm than good ! If they were effective we’d have had them at the start ! It’s just another way to control the sheep as they take away your freedoms
AGAINST	@nicely_nick @jonorfolk @GFL9112 It has too. This cannot be another stamp on our freedom.  You don't quarantine healthy people.  #NoMasks

AGAINST	@PJB174 No masks because they know they are useless for spread of virus!  The only purpose is to spread fear!  #DoNotComply
AGAINST	WA St’s gov  has issued a mandate that we have to be masked -I wish he added costumes. If I have to see the world walk by me in masks &amp; social distance, I would like the world to walk by me in costume w| their character’s signature walk. I think the world needs that. 
AGAINST	I lived for 59 years and never had to wear a mask in public, until the woke, participation trophy crowd came of age.  If you’re too afraid to live life, don’t ruin life for the rest of us. Stay at home.
AGAINST	@RichieAllenShow I think forcing children to wear masks In school will be the line. There are more people against that than there were for the masks in shops. I just wished all the groups against this tyranny would join forces. It is a united cause. #KeepBritainFree #KeepIrelandFree

AGAINST	@MrMasonMills @YcmiYcmiu There is air in houses/buildings too. Are we expected to live in a mask constantly?  I won't wear one at all.

AGAINST	@garethicke What MONTHS after the main event! Why were we not wearing face nappies in March-June. Cause we did not need them then and we certainly do not need them now. It is all to keep the FEAR going. Keeping it fresh in our minds, making it easier to give us a toxic vaccine. ffs 
AGAINST	@sventhurston @StarTribune If masks work why do you care if I don't where one?:thinking_face: These new found mask mandates are purely political and are just as wrong as quarantine for the Healthy.

NONE	@chuckwoolery I live in NYC, I can assure you Covid 19 is quite real. As I watch it rise across the country, I blame people like you for spewing absolute lies and gaslighting. Trump made this political instead stepping up and leading the entire country through this health crisis.
