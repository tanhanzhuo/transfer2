FAVOR	@SuzanneEvans1 @Jo_Turandot @LadyTrumpington Surgeons &amp; nurses wear them for hours every day standing up w/o breaks during surgeries. Cowgirl up. 
FAVOR	I try to be unbiased on my Twitter.  Which is why I’m saying Wear A Mask.  Because wearing a mask isn’t political or partisan. It’s common sense and kind to your fellow human.  We all have to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.  
FAVOR	@GOPLeader So 9 out of 10 members of Congress with Covid-19 is a Republican. Doesn’t that antidotal added to science tell you something? Covid-19 doesn’t care about your politics but the politics of the Republican Party have made it worse.
FAVOR	@AvantiWestCoast I’m in coach F en route to London Euston from Sandwell &amp; Dudley and two people opposite me do not have a facemask on? What is the process as I feel that it is irresponsible and also they’re not following the strict guidelines like others. #covid19

FAVOR	@KrisTStacey1 @Walmart What’s Schantz.   The Democrat Governors of WA and NY have both done a great job combatting #COVID19..  The Democrat mayor of NYC is a damn idiot tho.  Don’t be a #COVIDIOT, Kris.  
FAVOR	@ananavarro @nanelvisfan This pandemic, like any crisis, seems to squeeze the best and the worst of us out of the shadows. And he probably preaches about What Would Jesus Do. I’ll bet he’d wear a f**king mask.#COVIDIOTS
FAVOR	Can y’all wear masks so we can freely drink our coffees while shopping around without a mask around our faces?!
FAVOR	People who like to sew: a fat quarter of fabric is the perfect size to make two pleated masks :) cut it in half then in half again and double up two squares to make one mask. Make pleats By making 3-4 folds, sew the edges, and add ties. Done. #normalisemaskwearing 
FAVOR	I wonder what the coronation is to folks who buy lottery and don’t wear masks? #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	@DrNickCrombie Dr Nick, I agree it’s brilliant...but I’m disappointed that so many comments here show that either people lack a sense of humour!  and/or don’t get how essential both vaccinations and mask wearing are for our survival! Shocking! :joy::face_with_symbols_on_mouth:  #WearADamnMask  #MasksSaveLives
FAVOR	Is there still a pandemic or not? Everyone out there having their best summer life and I'm like this sucks #socialdistancing #Covid_19
FAVOR	Is it lost on anyone that the exact same people who bitch and moan and refuse to where a mask to save another human life are the EXACT SAME people who doggedly defend the 2nd amendment after 50 people get shot dead by an AK-47? #therightiswrong #COVIDー19
FAVOR	A guy with no mask just knocked on my door. I have big loud dogs, he backed away. I stuck my head out and he yelled across the yard. He's selling frozen beef. Holy hell, he came to my door with no mask.
FAVOR	Y’all, wearing a mask is great. I can mouth the words to the weird song I have in my head and no one looks at me funny.
FAVOR	It's ironic that some people refuse to wear a mask because they say it takes away their freedom, but when you do wear a mask, you have the freedom to go about anywhere &amp; in any store you want to.  Please #WearAMask so we can beat this, then none of us will have to
FAVOR	Over 155,000 Americans have succumbed to Covid-19 and too many more will.  Your right to not wear a mask is disrespectful to all front line workers and your fellow citizens.   Your right to not wear a mask contributes to our country’s horrific toll.
FAVOR	— frickin’ idea what they’re talking about and how people like her are part of the problem. Sure, masks aren’t the cure for #COVID19 . But it certainly helps in being a preventative from the spread of the virus. So, again, #WearAMaskPlease.
FAVOR	A to Z #NoMasks  Reason you r a Non-masker You are: Arrogant  Brainless Careless with others  Dumb Egotistical  Fox News Watcher Germ gigolo Hypocrite  Ill-informed￼ Jerk KKK sympathizer  Lame  Manic Narcissist￼ Oppressor  #Covid_19 #DrFauci #coronavirus #MaskUp

Ppl have worn clothes, shoes, hats, etc for years. Ppl wear seatbelts &amp; helmets. Athletes wear padding. Men wear condoms. No one ranted that rights were being violated when all of that stuff became a thing.
FAVOR	Just worked the front end of a central Iowa grocery store. Counted 508 people. 68 had on masks.. #iowa #COVIDIDIOTS #grocery
FAVOR	I guess I should’ve know any effort to flatten the curve that depended on an overwhelming majority of Americans to refrain from being self-centered was doomed to fail.
FAVOR	Because a lot of people STILL refuse to wear masks, and stay physically distant from others, I'm gearing up for some GREAT holidays, such as:  Hallowzoom Zoomsgiving Christzoom Zoom Year's Eve Zoomukkah Kwanzoom
FAVOR	@mickjason @PeteFestersen When the TSA started making us remove our shoes, practically strip &amp; let them see details of our bodies in X-ray-like machines just to get on a plane, did you stop flying? If not, why are you OK with that but wearing a mask makes you a #crybaby? #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	@NPR Is that Tucker Carlson?  #COVIDIOTS

FAVOR	Day 1292 with a contagious haiku: Endless quarantine. America is broken. Wear your fucking mask.
FAVOR	@jimdonovancbs3 @SEPTA No need to be patient. Not wearing a mask in public (as mandated by PA Governor) is the equivalent of swinging around a gun with the safety off; somebody’s going to get hurt. That said, I see Philadelphia P/O watch people walk around w/o masks and they say nada!
FAVOR	@Politidope @JoeGruters No mask? Careless, self-centered no concern for anyone else’s health. Don’t be like Joe
FAVOR	Friends, I just want to go to restaurants and attend music events again... but I can't... because I have a fucking brain, and I know you idiots are out there without masks, coughing on everyone else. #stayhome
FAVOR	Shut out to the gas station workers who even though the front door says mask mandatory weren’t wearing one but compliments my #AgentCarter mask!
FAVOR	It just occurred to me that since we will still be wearing face masks in the winter my nose will actually be warm.
FAVOR	I put a face mask over the air intake of my car to be safe and my car broke down. Who knew that limiting the air intake is bad for your car. It’s ok for the human body though isn’t it uncle @DanielAndrewsMP ? #resignDanielAndrews #endthelockdown
FAVOR	@OurRevolution An wear masks!!!!!!!
FAVOR	@RousseauRick She probably had too many non mask wearing assholes to deal with..lol. I feel bad the employees are left to enforce the masks. These stores need security to deal with the Covididiots :angry::angry::angry::angry:
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump And so many without masks!  Wtf, people?
FAVOR	@NeilClark66 @freddie801 Neil, stop being a snowflake and wear a mask. It won’t be forever, and it will help the most vulnerable to be protected against covid19. I wear one every day at work, it’s no big deal.
FAVOR	@BethanAngharadL @ks_1968 All the more recent evidence points to their effectiveness but you're quite right the precautionary principle demanded they be used.
FAVOR	@wheredoustand1 @Ms_Deville @lightfal @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Welp considering the it’s the States who are being travel banned right now and more people have died then in wars, maybe it’s not a hoax?  Ps had Trump taken Covid seriously, economy probably wouln’t have crashed like it did  #consequences 
FAVOR	More good news: 75% of healthy 45-53 yr old patients that recovered from Covid have permanent structural damage to their hearts = to a heart attack.  But masks are hot.
FAVOR	@AsburyParkPress Murphy needs to shut down the restaurants. None of the employees are keeping their faces covered. So unsanitary. #WearAMask
FAVOR	Refusing to wear a mask radiates small dick energy.
FAVOR	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.
FAVOR	@APCentralRegion @AP What a #COVIDIOT. #MaskUpMichigan #maskup
FAVOR	Masks set the precedent for vaccines. #COVID19
FAVOR	Starting today, people in Marion and Polk counties will be required to wear a face mask when they are in public, indoor spaces. This mandate comes in an attempt to prevent the spread of #COVID19. #Coronavirus #oregon #salemoregon #OR #SalemOR #clypiancoverage 
FAVOR	Tomorrow #NH will host a #NASCAR race that is expected to draw 12K.  We are the only state in the entire Norteast w/out a mask mandate. This is a potential #COVID19 superspreader event. You may be “over” the pandemic - but it’s not over you.
FAVOR	On the bus. Out of the 6 people on the lower deck only 2 have their masks on properly 3 have their mouths covered but their nose poking out and one has it round their neck. Just what is the point? It’s really not that hard
FAVOR	RT if you have at least one mask hanging from the rear view  mirror of ya car :mask: #MasksOnOhio
FAVOR	@SpeakerVos Masks in public places are a necessary prevention tool. You DON'T need to have symptoms to be infected. Many people get Covid and never experience symptoms- They're known as silent Carriers, who are indeed, Spreading the virus.
FAVOR	@JoeBiden What happens when we win the election and President Biden enacts a national mask mandate?  "Karens" will be coming out of the woodwork and it aint gonna be pretty.   How can we make this happen NOW?   #YesWeCanAgain #Biden2020Landslide
FAVOR	@mrswhite321 @Rachael1418 @GovMikeDeWine It isn’t. Mask or ventilator. Make your choice.
FAVOR	The realization of how many think we're nvincible to #COVID19 was never more apparent until we saw people actually walk into the funeral home with no mask defying our state order. You're literally standing with the dead all around you and you still don't get it.
FAVOR	People on India have to started to take this situation as a joke. People are no longer wearing masks and are roaming free. It's very disappointing.
FAVOR	We've also added an event in Philadelphia and a real dumb anti-mask rally in MN.  I'm still working up a tik tok joke, but I'm only on my first cup of coffee.  Keep an eye on this thread.  #BlackLivesMatter
FAVOR	T1 Buses in Aberaeron will not let you on the bus unless you are wearing a mask - exempt included!  This has buggered people up who I know are exempt ...   #MaskUp
FAVOR	@TheAltarOfAndy @JudgeJeanine That’s OK don’t wear a Mask go be THAT person but when you get sick don’t come crying as they intibate you
FAVOR	@BelTel Oh fuck off. Jaysus what's more offensive a mask or the way sick and disabled people are treated by the tories through pip assessments? But Boris cares sooo much about the people, I right. Fuckin do one
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump 25% OF WORLD DEATHS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE 4% OF WORLD POPULATION!!!! @WhiteHouse @PressSec @kayleighmcenany SPIN THAT, KAYLEIGH!! And DR. BIRX!! #GOPDeathCult #BloodOnTrumpsHands
FAVOR	I have an idea. Everyone has their temperature taken at the entrance of the bar. Everyone not wearing a mask gets it taken rectally.
FAVOR	Hey Team KC, y’all better put those Team Kelly masks up for sale!!! :raising_hands_light_skin_tone::thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	@Walmart start protecting your employees and customers and start regulating and mandating masks. I probably have it already as well as 8 other associates in my neighborhood market.  Please at least pretend you care.  They actually help. 
FAVOR	It may not be a representative sample, but it was still really gratifying seeing nearly everyone at the @MortonArboretum wearing masks yesterday on the paths.
FAVOR	I'm not condoning violence, but why are all the stories about people catching a beating over masks about people who actually comply? You would think the non-mask wearers would be the ones on the run.:thinking_face: #MaskItOrCasket
FAVOR	@wiscontext @WashCoWisco @PBSWI @WashCoExec Over 148,000 Americans :flag_for_United_States: have died. We are not showing them any respect or learning from the senseless deaths that could be avoided by wearing a mask. Obviously Washington County and other counties are failing as  #COVID19 # 's keep:arrow_up::arrow_up:
FAVOR	@steeletalk @richardzussman @masks4canada @CKNW Thank goodness! She needs to be shown the light because clearly she refuses to believe in mask use. It makes zero sense.
FAVOR	Get use to being uncomfortable, so ADAPT to NEW NORMAL! WEAR THE MASK! 
FAVOR	Oh, I can’t tonight. I washing my masks. #SocialDistancing
FAVOR	@StopandShop Hey there..“No Mask No Service” is not being enforced in your Hempstead trpk and Wantaugh ave location. Have to stare down folks with a chinstraps every turn I make. I care about my senior mother that I take food shopping! This is pitiful! #StopAndShop
FAVOR	The only constitutional right your mask is violating is your right to get sick and die.  Wear a mask you fucking ape.
FAVOR	@nuts2406 @JayaTigerLily @VJ79654309 @Srinivas_Kamath @JayaTigerLily is just ad nauseum repeating her diatribe. One where she offers no science, no logic, no evidence that is abreast with understanding and advisories issued by health authorities. She is sabotaging efforts to create awareness here on Masks!
FAVOR	@mikemcmannmd @AllieGatorFL @Tips89_ @GovRonDeSantis @BrowardHealth You understand that he literally altered scientific data to help @realDonaldTrump right!?  And he won’t issue a mask mandate
FAVOR	Nothing like getting b*tched at by a Karen to ruin your afternoon. And of course, she was about a foot away from me and not wearing a mask. :face_with_rolling_eyes: Perfect.
FAVOR	@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Dear Senator, thank you for all you do to represent Oregon. Hair clippers are fairly inexpensive and easy to use. Or next time you’re in the valley, I’ll even trim your hair, mask and all. And as an educator I have practiced social distancing all summer.  :scissors_selector: :man_getting_haircut_selector:
FAVOR	Just got word that my coworker tested positive for covid-19. He was anti mask and went to parties without any care for the people around him. Now because of him I'm scared for my life.  Please for the love of god, #WearAMask
FAVOR	@DeanObeidallah @TheDeansreport @CNNOpinion Imagine being such a selfish asshole that you place your desire not to wear a mask as more important than a human life.
FAVOR	@PollyAndry @AnaCabrera What, are they children??? Grow up ppl &amp; wear the damn mask! This is not about politics, not about Liberty and not about YOU.  It is about 150K FELLOW AMERICANS who have NEEDLESSLY DIED bc of ignorant &amp; selfish choices made by others.
FAVOR	I tested positive for Covid. Got it from a friend. I assumed she was being responsible for my safety when she asked to meet for lunch. Found out she was infected by an online date. She didn't know him. She didn't wear a mask. Or distance. I then exposed my parents.
FAVOR	@RightWingWatch I wonder what his take would be on “No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service” #Masks
FAVOR	ANYBODY WHO SAYS MASK ARENT EFEECTIVE DONT GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, THEY’RE ALREADY SICK.... MENTALLY #WearAMask
FAVOR	@RileyKays @GiroSammy @HeatherBadenoch @nytimes @FuzzyWuzzyTO It’s incorrect but it if makes you feel better it’s simple: stay home as much as possible, wear a fabric mask when you do have to go out and get some surgical masks if you need to be out for extended periods of time.  You’re welcome
FAVOR	A face mask in not impeding your everyday life. I just went into a sandwich shop and a sausage bap, wearing a face covering. It's so simple...
FAVOR	It doesn't feel safe to ride with the @MBTA because they aren't enforcing their mask policy on all their trains
FAVOR	Wear a mask please.  #WearAMask
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump They just closed my towns city hall indefinitely because an employee tested positive.  Adults can't figure out masks and social distancing.  But sure lets cram kids into buses and classrooms. #TrumpVirus2020
FAVOR	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV &amp; only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin.
FAVOR	People in India are no longer serious about this situation. There are cases increasing everyday and people are getting careless. I am disappointed. So if not for your wear a mask for others.
FAVOR	@Starbucks I went to Starbucks at 2961 Michelson Dr, Irvine, CA 92612 at 1:30 pm today. Cashier and the girl at order pick up counter were not wearing face mask. This seems not implementing California order. #Starbucks 
FAVOR	@HomelessnessSD @victv This is ridiculous. I’m all for religion, just safe from my couch. As a San Diego women who got covid from a restaurant in Carlsbad. (Negative now). Wear a damn mask people, I almost died from this crap!
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump If YOU STUPID:face_with_symbols_on_mouth::face_with_symbols_on_mouth::face_with_symbols_on_mouth:#MAGA MORONS had worn masks since March like the rest of us did, the #COVID19 virus would no longer be spreading EXPONENTIALLY (look it up) and our schools COULD REOPEN and economy would be well into recovery - like the REST of the WORLD!:triumph::triumph::triumph::triumph:
FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd Yes... exactly... "harass cake eaters and bakeries" if that's your bliss. Really! But please do it without shouting. Follow the law, follow local regs, respect store policies, and puleeezzz wear a mask. :grin:
FAVOR	There's many reasons someone may not wear a mask. The only one that should concern anyone is that it's none of your business. Protect yourself. #COVID__19 #MaskUp
FAVOR	I work 10 hours in a 96 degree wearhouse walking 20,000+ steps a day and lifting heavy boxes and I wear a mask. STOP COMPLAINING YOU CANT BREATH WELL ENOUGH TO WALK 30 MiN WITH A MASK. 
FAVOR	In March our amazing backyard neighbor died from COVID-19. Today I’m watching people (thankfully wearing masks) go through all his stuff as part of an estate sale. It’s all so sad. If we had shut down earlier, he would likely still be here.
FAVOR	Spending the afternoon watching a 3-on-3 youth soccer tournament at @etownsportspark. Beautiful day...but a shame there’s no signage or enforcement of mask wearing. Come on...we can do better! @KYHealthAlerts
FAVOR	My mask doesn't stop... um, let's say 'Herefordshire scents' but it does keep my mouth dry from rain.  In other words, oxygen can get through masks, but droplets containing the virus cannot.
FAVOR	13 hrs with a face mask today. Non-stop! If I hear someone complaining ...
FAVOR	Twitter folk are uber sensitive today! #MaskUp
FAVOR	Don’t be an ignoramous; wear a damn mask.
FAVOR	Covid-19 cases rise so highly meanwhile the people awareness of Covid-19 has been rapidly going down at the low level. Whenever I went outside, I saw most people didn't wear mask. That also indicate how people stupidity is rapidly going up at the high level
FAVOR	I know everyone’s freaked about American tourists coming to Ireland but I was shopping in dunnes earlier &amp; half the shop weren’t wearing masks :woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone: can we at least try to get it right ourselves, please 
FAVOR	@jeffmason1 @realDonaldTrump at least 22 people in this photo and maybe 3 are wearing masks... They run our government :face_with_rolling_eyes:
FAVOR	I wonder if the people concerned about Co2 accumulating in their #masks and effecting how they breath, are the same people that don’t believe in the science behind the #ClimateChange?   
FAVOR	@MBellmoore @edmontonleon @kindermeg You're a moron Mitchell. But I scrolled your TL, so it's not exactly a surprise to me. Don't like the mandatory masks, feel free to stay home, away from the people are capable of critical thinking
FAVOR	Face masks are a lot like condoms. Nobody WANTS to wear em but, you should be wearing them to keep yourself and others safe.
FAVOR	You know the whole point of a mask mandate is to WEAR the mask? NOT put it on your ear and let it hang or leave it by your water bottle or not wear it at all.
FAVOR	@FakeNewsDotCom2 @HaroldJ62777849 @bucforever @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump Social Distance. Stay home. Don’t open the economy too soon. Wear a mask: The plans that we do have are based on science and they work, no thanks to ignoramus-in-chief. #SocialDistancing #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	At this point I will happily take a couple of months of martial law just so that at the end of it I can get back to my fucking life! WEAR YOUR MASK PEOPLE AND PUT IT OVER YOUR GOD DAMN NOSE! I hate this fucking city #Nashville #COVIDIOT #coronavirus
FAVOR	@casitruth @madeamerican3 @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods Love how she’s not staying 6 feet away because her miracle mask will keep her safe! Dumb people need to stay home!
FAVOR	If you can find a better place to buy gas than @Wawa - do so. I went to buy pretzels at Lionville 113 store and a white male was brazenly in the store without a mask. You need to refuse service to people not wearing masks. #WearAMask
FAVOR	Not wearing a mask is "small dick energy."
FAVOR	@Patriotize Yep masks only worn in the O.R. and infection contagion risk areas of high risk patients. And they were not these cheap ass blue and white paper masks they were N95 respirator masks. :pray::flag_for_United_States::heart::frog:
FAVOR	@ESPNMichele @Rachel__Nichols Prayers for Mr. Rodriguez :folded_hands_light_skin_tone:.  Wear your mask please. Don’t care about your political party, please for the sake of commen sense, for sports, for kids, for your kids or your parents.
FAVOR	Well, it finally happened. Someone close to me has been diagnosed with #COVID19  It is absolutely terrifying to watch. Please
FAVOR	@MiaFarrow Look at all the gear our medical professional are wearing but folks want to whine and complain about wearing a mask??
FAVOR	#sundayvibes don’t consider yourself a pro life Republican if you won’t wear a mask :mask:
FAVOR	@calhouns So you won’t have employees wear mandated face masks?  So long.  Will NEVER frequent your restuarants!!  Maybe you could not enforce the smoking law too.  #calhouns #knoxville
FAVOR	@garethicke @Norrienon anyone who doesn't comply with face coverings ect deserve to catch covid and end on a ventilator and die #WearAMask
FAVOR	Wearing masks during the pandemic is obviously a necessity, and those that aren't are just selfish or moronic. I wear a neck gaiter mask and it doesn't bother me at all, in fact it makes me feel better (probably due to my anxiety) - Am I alone in feeling that way?
FAVOR	DO NOT REOPEN SCHOOLS!! #DoNotReopenSchools #ProtectStudents #KeepUsSafe #COVID19 #MaskUp
FAVOR	The difference between anti seatbelt &amp; anti mask people is that the latter is leaving a digital footprint of their ignorance for their grandkids.  
FAVOR	@RightWingWatch What if, stay with me on this, the mask wasn't an affront to his freedom, but a statement about his compassion for others.  Also, he's f***ing idiot and we'd appreciate it if people like him didn't wrap their ignorance in our flag.
FAVOR	@Glowysoe @OGKBEAR @Dadilicious2 @KingRezizt @WeinreichHolly @realCheeto1 @NicoleNunn20 @ccsllew @AmateurMmo @Pittsburgbitch @leahbake @Duke_of_Phale @Burgh_bitch @cookiem89151957 @TroianoNic @MelindaRenee72 @JTSand138138 @TrumpBear4 @comeundone0 @AndyPadrutt @BResisting @JoeBiden @MeidasTouch @Eiggam5955 @brianlewis3282 @waltsimsjr @onit1977 @jenjones207 @BigPixieKiss @Flyin_Nrs @Peatches66 @Boomer818 @Jeff_resist @babaloo2 @TruthfulReal1ty @BradyBoo75 @AngBonCan @Wikweko @Brentp56 @WilliamFPeters2 @BackNBlack1975 @CapAmerica1111 @BogdanoffElaine @TCRG2012 @YetiEye @100Mohawk @CheyenneNDN @BrahmaGreg @Rob83753057 @RandomFSM The Whitehouse Cowboy is a slow learner, but even he realises that masks slow the spread of Covid. I’d rather listen to medical specialists- WHO, CDC than the quack Immanuel spouting about dream sex with demons causing Covid. Viruses don’t have a political agenda?
FAVOR	@KrisTStacey1 Just try test driving what you think your Constitutional rights are... you’ll get kicked out of Bass Pro Shop...and anywhere else you try to shop without a mask.  You do not have the right to put other people’s health in danger.
FAVOR	Still beyond me why teens will not be wearing masks in schools :thinking_face:
FAVOR	@DianeEv62398271 Yes. Wear the damn mask.  It's. Not. Hard.  But if it feels hard for you. Remember.  We can do hard things.  @GlennonDoyle #MaskUp

FAVOR	If you think wearing a mask makes you look stupid, when's the last time you looked in the mirror? 
FAVOR	Face masks will now be compulsory on public transport says Minister @Ross_Shane1. Great that he's put an end to the 'maybes' and 'perhaps' ' which have delayed the decision by weeks.
FAVOR	Today is the first time I have had to visit my doctors office since COVID began. I’m very impressed at how things are being run but the only way these services will remain accessible is if you wear a mask. So please
FAVOR	Seriously, why do I smile as I pass by people while wearing my mask? But still, 
FAVOR	I am so fucking tired of GROWN ADULTS whining and complaining about having to wear a mask in our restaurant. I'm sorry..are you not an ADULT? is it too hard to be a fucking grown up?!
FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Fickster69 @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd You're very UNexcited about Costco rules, unfortunately... I hope for my health and the health of everyone that you follow Costco rules and related laws to preserve public health... Please wear a mask and don't spread germs in public. :grin:
FAVOR	@eastantrimmp I went to an ice cream parlor I love. While I ordered, I wore a mask. I sat down, took it off, &amp; enjoyed my dessert. I used hand sanitizer on everything I touched &amp; the table. I put my mask back on, thanked them, &amp; left. It’s not that hard! #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	@5_2blue He’s not a pastor. He’s a pretentious anal retentive self righteous princess jackass. Probably a closet Colonel Frank Fitz: A product of his own self antagonistic orientation. Send him a mask, not a gift card. #fools
FAVOR	@kurteichenwald @NanaMof5 multi-generational households are traditionally POC &amp; taking it home to their grandmas &amp; parents is the feature not the bug w/ this “@WhiteHouse plan” for this [corona]virus.  #DeliberateSpreaders seems obvious it’s why we’re STILL arguing abt masks.
FAVOR	@davidnwelton @mkraju @SherrynAdair @SpeakerPelosi It’s time for people to act responsibly. There is enough evidence that masks work. Adults shouldn’t have to be told to wear a mask. It’s not a political statement it’s what makes us all safer.
FAVOR	I wonder if we said new evidence supported #COVID19 was an attack on the world from socialist space aliens, would we see more people start wearing masks? #boringIndependenceDay #WelcometoEarth #WearADamnMask 
FAVOR	@ceastwoo @sternergulch @traceygaughran @GovLarryHogan Your "logic" is typical of the uneducated. Just because THEY didn't die doesn't mean other people won't or won't have life long effects. You really are willing to sacrifice them #COVIDIOTS You probably don't even get the flu shot. Bunch of nutcases you all are
FAVOR	Watching the willingness of #Iranian Women, of the #bbcpersian #VOA elite/class, i can see it is #Islamophobia which drives their “No Hejab” calls for #Iran. #HumanRights has nothing to do with it, otherwise they would refuse masks more so. #Hypocrites are #parasites.
FAVOR	Wear.A.Damn.Mask.
FAVOR	141 days into the US #COVID19 pandemic. With all the information we have about the benefit of wearing #masks, if you aren’t, you are responsible for the continued spread, deaths, illness, closures, financial ruin, and ongoing horror!

FAVOR	@Politics_PR The most interesting thing is how the ones who’ve hollered about the masks being unnecessary and that the virus isn’t real are the ones now getting coronavirus. Know who aren’t getting it? Most people who’ve been wearing masks the whole time.

FAVOR	@RhapsoDani I hope quarantine doesn’t mean you don’t get out for walks almost daily, which is good for you &amp; critical for kids; if you social distance it doesn’t present a serious risk. Those w underlying conditions should be able to get a KN95 mask, which protects the wearer

FAVOR	If you're not willing to wear a mask at a grocery store (even when it's mandatory), could you at least utilize their delivery or pickup options (which is often free)? You are gaining nothing. Does the thrill of walking down the cereal really mean that much to you?

FAVOR	@JohnCornyn Trying to be a smart ass!!!  Dr Fauci is the only expert we need!!! #TrumpDeathToll137K  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe  #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie  
FAVOR	It’s good to see a shift in consumer behavior re: masks when corporations (esp. those that serve non-compliant areas) enact rules. Virtually no masks ~1mo ago at my parent’s local @Walmart. Today? &gt;70% compliance. (Both observations based on my experience.)
FAVOR	@AuthenticVegas @CityOfLasVegas @iheartmindy @realDonaldTrump I have cancer, I do not go out except for blood tests and chemo.  There are people in line at Quest with no mask, even though their sign says "no entry without a mask".  I would like to go out, shop, eat in a restaurant, but I am terrified.
FAVOR	@GavinNewsom pls doing an ad campaign on how to wear your mask properly. So many ppl are not. Especially those making an$ handling our food #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	@InsidersABC @CaseyBriggs From what my Melburnian friends are reporting, the restrictions aren’t working because PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE WITHOUT MASKS &amp; gathering in groups for picnics &amp; sitting outside restaurants &amp; cafes with their takeaways. #StayHomeSaveLives
FAVOR	I would just like to say to the two young - I am not going to call them men because they don’t deserve it – boys who laughed and called me crazy when I put on a mask as they ran past me on the trail… Good luck boys. #parkcity
FAVOR	@Jerry_Kersey @JadeIsMad @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump You contracted it with the mask on, because other people aren’t wearing one. Your mask protects them from you. Masks only work if EVERYONE wears one!
FAVOR	@sheenagupta @Theonlyhonest Omg thank you and be careful Dr!! :heart: #WearAMask
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump With no masks for elementary schools
FAVOR	@DrEricDing tried outdoor seating in santa cruz ca. unfortunately restaurant cant stop people waiting for a table, hanging out, or coming along a walkway from leaning against their rails too close to diners. plenty of middle school aged kids sans masks #covid 
FAVOR	My new nightmare in my sleep is not going to jail, is not robbery or falling. My new nightmare is forgetting to wear my mask in public and dying from the coronavirus. Do me a favor, to reduce my anxiety wear a fucking mask or stay at home. Thank you.
FAVOR	@AnaCabrera Why can’t people follow rules and wear a darn mask?! #MaskUp
FAVOR	@KETV Yessssss!! What a powerful and true statement. We need this mask mandate. #Stopthespread
FAVOR	@JCrazytown You mean where the majority of people were wearing masks to this where they aren’t, we also didn’t get spikes from areas with major protests. Places like Florida who had beaches open though huge spikes. Facts are hard.
FAVOR	COVID-19 is NO JOKE. Don’t wait until a loved one gets infected to realize this!
FAVOR	@DonnyTheMessiah @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump @ProjectLincoln @ProjectLincoln is driving you fucking crazy, and we love it!!! Truth hurts you piece of shit! :one::one::three: day’s until we #voteforJoeBiden:flag_for_United_States::mask:
FAVOR	If a mask mandate could help save lives and violates the law, CHANGE! THE! LAW! NOT having the mandate could actually be helping kill people, do you really want that on your shoulders @GovRicketts? #youcandoit
FAVOR	Jesus Christ would wear a mask.
FAVOR	Every non-masker should have to go to the bedside of someone in their community dying of Covid-19 and explain to them why they think it’s ok to not wear masks. #WearAMask #WearMasks #WearAMaskSaveALife
FAVOR	@SueDeWitt4 @Ann_Isik @GinaEllis4 @Lezlie61 @CorporatePiggie @ricball I don’t understand these people who will not wear a mask :mask:. Inconsiderate fools.
FAVOR	Not sure why there’s so much pant pissing about having to wear a face covering for a short amount of time. Judging by a lot of the folk moaning about it, a face covering is doing them a favour!  #masks  
FAVOR	@Nitrozac @LizaYuzda @LaceyLaceyp @richardzussman @CBCtanya @Bernardo1130 and yet @DrBonnieHenry @CDCofBC still not a fan of requiring masks. It doesn't make sense. Even Trump and Pence have been wearing and promoting them and that's the bottom of the intellectual barrel!
FAVOR	It's mind boggling to me the number of people that still aren't wearing masks/wearing masks correctly. Georgia is nowhere close to flattening the curve.
FAVOR	@MikeoxlongUSA @10DowningStreet But far fewer, as they tend to adhere to the droplets of moisture in your breath and these get trapped in your mask.  You DO realise the point of a mask is to protect others rather than yourself, don't you?  
FAVOR	When I see many people wearing black face masks I feel like I’m on the set of an S&amp;M film. Not that I’ve been on one but still... #WearADamnMask #mask
FAVOR	Wear a damn mask! Wear a damn mask! #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	Watching the @penguins play in an empty arena is sad. Mostly because people won't wear freaking masks so this is what it has come to.
FAVOR	@BrianCorbett01 @AnaCabrera No one is cocky. THERE'S A PANDEMIC. Not that I would be on a plane FOR ANY REASON right now but if I was, I don't want your germs so #WearADamnMask . Wearing a mask is protecting OTHER PEOPLE so stop being so damn selfish. I wear a mask to PROTECT YOU !
FAVOR	I hung a "Help Us Stay Open, Please wear a mask in our shop" sign on our door this morning.  Mom &amp; Pop shops don't have sick days.  We don't have employees.  Cases in our county are rising fast (thank you, evangelical revival &amp; church camp attendees).  
FAVOR	@charliekirk11 People in the streets wear masks
FAVOR	I am becoming obsessed with mask fashion.
FAVOR	I have two military sons training in full uniform and masks. So spare me your I can't breathe for 10 minutes in a store.
FAVOR	So its the first day of compulsory masks here and i just went to the post office and on the way i passed a girl holding her mask in her hand and then both of the staff at the post office had their masks down on their chins.
FAVOR	@thehill The person in this photo isn't even wearing their mask correctly.
FAVOR	@KAG45Patriot #facemasks are mostly effective when wore by the sick people. As it is difficult to know who is sick and who is not, if mass people #WearAMask in public places it can significantly reduce the spread of the virus.
FAVOR	Morning guys so I've been reading about people doing what they like in a pandemic all those selfish selfish people going to the beach do you want to end up in hospital ? Not to mention infecting each other this is ideal.for Corona to spread think about your actions
FAVOR	@grandmagrit I live in NY. Happy to say most people wear a mask. Rarely do I see maskless people.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump I assume all of the Sheriffs, who weren’t social distancing or wearing masks, had Covid tests the past two days to confirm multiple negative tests?   As a Republican, I know we can do better Mr. President.
FAVOR	PSA: If I can wear a mask for 7 hours of my shift, you can wear one for a couple hours shopping.  Also, please wash and sanitise hands in stores.  It's to keep you and staff safe.  Thank you to those who follow the rules. Stay safe. :v:  #facemasks #wearamask 
FAVOR	@NickInEngland @tubedbeam @jamesmfahy Sorry Nick, I don't live my life on Twitter. Masks have been mandatory since May in Spain, infections are up,local lockdowns enforced. Muslim women wear full face coverings in public.The Muslim community are still suffering the greatest rate of infections in uk.
FAVOR	As my friend @LaurenEMorrill says, "I don't know how to explain to you that you should care about other people." This pandemic is ravaging our country, specifically Black and brown communities and the Navajo Nation. Stay home, wear a mask, and save lives.
FAVOR	Swearing at people underneath your mask #lockdownbenefits #WearAMask
FAVOR	@markmobility There is no covid surge from any demo. Masks masks masks work.  Wear a mask. Get it on.  #covid19 #getiton 
FAVOR	Every time me and little kid wave at each other from afar while both wearing our masks, a fairy gets its wings. That’s how good it feels to protect friends and strangers.
FAVOR	Add @Academy to the list of places not enforcing the #Texas mask mandate. Lost my business today.
FAVOR	@NeelaJan @GregHuntMP There’s so many good reasons to support wearing a mask, and so few reasons not to.  Glad our leaders are getting onboard. 
FAVOR	Asked him directly to properly wear his mask and he declined. Said NO. So, he prefers to spread #COVID19 rather than prevent the spread. What kind of horrible company are you? I'm outraged. He said NO. Fire him! @Sunrun #Sunrun
FAVOR	@Scaramucci @TymberDalton I'm hoping that I have by wearing my mask since March.
FAVOR	I just saw a tweet that said something like “I don’t want to wear a mask cause then it’ll be normalized.”   If you don’t wear a mask NOW, it WILL become normalized and become part of every day life even after this. So wear it now, so we don’t have to later.
FAVOR	I don’t know about anyone else but I am getting used to this mask and my nose isn’t cold from the AC anymore. Bring on winter I have a cozy new face warmer. #WearAMask
FAVOR	@akash_b1 @DewarNorris @Alan9White @JC_free82 Well why don’t you wear a helmet, knee &amp; elbow pads every day.:face_with_rolling_eyes: to the shops because of all the risks or just take your mask out of your arse pocket and and put it around your mouth. Tip on #NoNewNormal
FAVOR	@DWUhlfelderLaw @Surgeon_General And evidently today according to our "leader", there is a decline. Lies, lies, lies. No testing over weekend so of course the numbers are down. I don't need a math degree to figure that out. But #DeathSantis got pat on back for job well done
FAVOR	When Covid selects its victims I hope it targets the arrogant bell ends who refuse to wear masks in shops. Knobs!! :rage:
FAVOR	@EricEganTV @WKRN Good for them! So tired of reading constant stories of those who refuse to abide by mask mandates. Equally tired of abuse workers are facing to try to enforce them.
FAVOR	3. In many countries these are being handed free out at metros, supermarkets, town halls and doctor's surgeries. Home made ones don't usually clip over the nose so are pretty useless. Why is England so arrogant that it won't learn from other countries? 
FAVOR	Putting this out for the world out of true curiosity. For people who choose not to wear masks. What would you have to see in order for you to put one on? #facemasks
FAVOR	@AnaCabrera We HAVE to start calling it out. These ppl defending not wearing masks are idiots. I have no problem w ppl's stupidity only affecting them.  But I have a BIG problem w Us All having to be at risk delayed and inconvenienced because a Ken and/or a Karen won't just
FAVOR	@politico I’ve been wondering why almost every photo taken around the world shows everyday people wearing masks... Not in the United States. #trump #coronavirus
FAVOR	@vincentdonofrio I live in Georgia and I am embarrassed by the stupidity of our state to not do the right thing.  It will take for each person to give someone they love to get this shit and they die before they get it.  I wear a mask for my child &amp; family
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Look at all you assholes not wearing a mask.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump These countries ISOLATED - broke the vector. The truth is studies reveal there's likely 10x more virus out there than positive testing results. DON'T BE A VECTOR... #SocialDistancing
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump The #trumpzombies will send their kids back to school &amp; praise you...Until their kids &amp; teachers start getting sick &amp; spreading it into their homes!! #TrumpVirusDeathToll158K #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasNoCredibility #VoteForOurLives #RepublicansAgainstTrump
FAVOR	@pjhelliar Turned up to our worksite to paint yesterday. 6 concreters, 2 chippies, 2 pool blokes, all without masks on and working in the one area. We walked off site and got eyes rolled at us and laughed at.
FAVOR	Dear @Se_Railway Commuters,  I can understand hesitancy &amp; deliberation if we were discussing a vaccine, but we are simply asking you be selfless &amp; to wear a mask. My mask protects you, your mask protects me.   #Coronavirus #COVID19 
FAVOR	Raging at the impudence around me. I keep meeting +Covid people who don't wear a mask whose family refuses testing and wearing masks but STILL go around the community. This is not a joke your SELFISHNESS is killing your loved ones, caregivers, my friends, humanity.
FAVOR	@DoroLef @sl2016_sl @ThoughtOfTrying @ARealGirlReview @Nicolette_O @Shannon_Skinner @HHLifestyleTrav @TumiWith Awesome @DoroLef ! Great to see so many caring people around the world ! #MaskWearersAroundtheworld #WearAMask
FAVOR	Every day I hear the experts tell us, to wear a mask, social distance and avoid crowds. So how come we aren't doing it?? Trump keeps saying the virus is under control, but its not. .Abby if you stop liking to everybody we could get this thing under control.
FAVOR	The world we live in... a simple face covering becomes another battle front in the fight for our humanity.  #WearAMask
FAVOR	It disturbs me that with everything going on with #covid19 cases sharply rising that #repairmen are not automatically wearing masks! Even when they come into your home. Even the cashier at the #mechanics. This needs to be addressed! #Raleigh #Cary @RoyCooperNC #wakecounty
FAVOR	Until we move from “me” to “we”, COVID isn’t going anywhere and is only going to get worse 
FAVOR	@Patzfan5112 @WADeptHealth @GovInslee Many people, including a massive number of idiots in Yakima County did not (and many still don’t) wear masks when advised and then mandated. Many others are only doing it halfway...as in not covering nose and mouth. Bottom line:
FAVOR	Not ashamed to mask-shame #WearAMask
FAVOR	As the virus continues to spread uncontrollably, nearly half the riders in my #metra car today don't have masks. Mandates from the govt and promises from the agency do no good if conductors don't remind riders that masks are required and hand them out as needed.
FAVOR	@jeffmason1 @realDonaldTrump How are these #COVIDIOTS still alive. They are crowded in a room with no masks. I’m shocked that the press are not wearing masks. Shameful!
FAVOR	@Constance8News @peterframpton I’m so sorry for your loss. My whole family wears masks, even my adult daughter who has cerebral palsy and severe intellectual disabilities. She knows how important it is!!
FAVOR	@ABC So nobody wears a mask in South Carolina???
FAVOR	@TheTollington @AGildedEye @TomDCoates @NHSuk Thank you. I'm nowhere near you to come in:wine_glass:later, but appreciate yr efforts!

FAVOR	@Freeyourmindkid Most in photo not wearing a mask. #TrumpVirus kills kids. Don’t be stupid.
FAVOR	@LeonardRoxon McD's food is proven addictive. This heavy-handed action equates a dealer to an addict - wear a mask or don't get your hit :confounded: #HoaxVirus
FAVOR	Like is it so hard to wear a fucking mask in a grocery store for the length of time you shop!! I have to wear mine for my entire 9 hour shift!! I’m so tired of yelling at customers that to put their mask on and the mask has to be covering their mouth and nose!!
FAVOR	@JazzieX0O @JuliansRum @realDonaldTrump You are a disappointment to the world at large for being so willingly stupid, selfish and ignorant. You don't want to wear a mask because they are uncomfortable and hot and sweaty.
FAVOR	What's pissing me off today whilst out and about for work, is seeing people carrying on like nothing's happening, whilst Covid is very much still circulating plus the fact, people just don't/won't wear face masks whilst in shops 
FAVOR	Dear Trump campaign,   If you send another person to knock on my door without a mask on, I’m going to throw dog shit at them.   Thank you for your understanding in these trying times,  April   #WomenAgainstTrump
FAVOR	I wish someone would tell the millions of medical staff world wide the masks they are wearing are:  &gt; Government tracking devices  &gt; Aliens that will attack and eat their faces.   I hope they find out soon. Thoughts and prayers.    #COVID19 #Masks
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump You and your task force are a disgrace. The Navajo Nation has more deaths from COVID-19 than 13 states combined!   We need Dr. Fauci. Not you. We need a real national response that looks after everyone!
FAVOR	Wearing your mask below your nose is like using a condom with the tip cut off. Absolutely Worthless. 
FAVOR	@BreesAnna @JamesCranworth Our ancestors fought against people being gassed you complete sausage. A mask in a shop for 20 minutes is first world selfish mother fucking problems.
FAVOR	It needs to stop. If this is a thing you believe, it's YOU that's currently causing the most harm. Shut the fuck up, sit down, wear a mask and stop spreading your moist bullshit. I don't want to die because you're a fucking idiot.   #COVID19AB
FAVOR	Helpful hint for your gaslit trumpanzee friends (if you’re into that):  Put your mask on. Don’t mess with it. Wash your hands often.  #MasksDontKill
FAVOR	“A sleep-away camp in Georgia: Of the 600 campers and staff members, nearly half became infected within a week of orientation. The camp took precautions but did not require campers to wear masks. Singing and cheering may have helped spread the virus.” #noshit
FAVOR	Let’s agree that if you choose NOT to wear a mask in general public settings, then you forfeit any health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage and medical services by the front line workers the moment you COVID positive. Sign here.. #publichealth #COVID19 #insurance
FAVOR	Welp. My immuno-compromised husband &amp; I can't go on evening walks in the park anymore because here in Pittsburgh, the HOTSPOT of PA, only about 1/3 of people are wearing masks.   Hey Pittsburgh, if you're going out, WEAR YOUR MASKS! #Pittsburgh
FAVOR	@TheJordanRachel Your running won’t affect my weight. Your mask wearing will affect my health. If you haven’t figured that out, you’re an idiot. If you have figured it out, you’re incredibly selfish. I run to protect my health. I wear a mask to protect others. Get over yourself.
FAVOR	@chelsea_hetho @DanielAndrewsMP Thank you for that!!! - Time for a quick walk then. :mask:  #stayathome
FAVOR	@natjone93 Yelling in people’s faces while not wearing a mask during a pandemic is messed up. It’s like trying to kill them and possibly their families. It’s also not a good idea for the protesters themselves who might be spreading it to each other.
FAVOR	Sorry but if the worst thing in your life right now is being expected to wear a mask to help keep people alive, shut up and put it on, please.
FAVOR	@cregishuman @Steel94010 @luke_california @benshapiro Look a #COVIDIOT #TrumpDeathCult member. #resist the #TrumpDeathCult they want to kill us all. @GavinNewsom @SupervisorCox @SupFletcher @ToddGloria we need protection from the virus and domestic terrorists like anti mask guy. #Gettested #StaySafeStayHome
FAVOR	Am I ever going to learn that my phone doesn’t recognize me when I have my mask on? But still...
FAVOR	@MeredthSalenger These #KarensGoneWild are part of the reason #COVID19 keeps getting worse, spreading more &amp; not slowing down! She thinks she’s had it with the stupid, huh? I have bad news for all who think like her.....they’re the stupid! #WearADamnMask #BeBetter #KindnessMatters
FAVOR	@drmlb Why aren't all of the kids wearing masks?!?!  Its not that complicated.
FAVOR	Another question...do the people wearing the masks below their nose know it is also connected to their lungs?
FAVOR	Hey Indianapolis folks who feel they don’t need to mask: did an @IMS without fans in the stands get your attention? Wear a damn mask and distance!
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump He's an expert, you're a failed tv host/failed businessman (who bankrupted a casino!) so I'll go with Dr. Fauci.  The US has more cases due to your FAILURE to act, FAILURE to lead #TrumpVirus #ImPOTUS #TrumpGolfsYouDie #PutinsPuppet #PutinsGOP
FAVOR	You won’t wear a mask? If I get it from you, and I pass it on to my elderly mum, you’re a dead man. #COVID19AB  #COVID19
FAVOR	@SoyBoyRoy1 @realDonaldTrump So the foxtrot uniform charlie kilo at least I'm wearing a MF mask. I have plenty. Worry about your germ spreading President who has no respect for the health of others. At least I respect my fellow American by wearing a mask. Do you? Good bye

FAVOR	@CamScott353 @ThomasDixon1000 @WhiteHouse Exactly this.   What do the patients think the masks are for?!   “I just had my appendix out. Crazy surgeon had some kind of mask fetish.”  :face_with_rolling_eyes:
FAVOR	I come from 6 months into the future and let me tell you all you looked really cute in your christmas themed facemasks.  #christmas #facemask #facecover
FAVOR	Hey so, something weird happened when I went to get my mums medication, some guy honked his car horn at me and gave me a thumbs up, was it because I was wearing a mask? #Covid_19 
FAVOR	@Patriot59476447 @13WHAM The protesters in my town wear masks, just like everyone else that can't social distance. Masks work.
FAVOR	Hey folks, if you wear a mask I think: She has her reasons. So if I don't wear a mask, you think: She has her reasons.  It's called respect. If we're divided, we're all in trouble.  #MaskUp
FAVOR	@IAmHighOnHeels #Masks are important in the fight against #Covid_19 Come on!
FAVOR	@amyisfedup No i think the same thing. And that there selfish assholes. I dont want to take the chance of maybe causing someones death so i always wear a mask.
FAVOR	I’m tired of the “I have asthma” excuse for not wearing a mask.   One of our regulars, who comes in multiple times a week has asthma. Let’s call him Steve. He wears his mask EVERY TIME.   He also only has oNE LUNG. And he does not complain.   Be like Steve.
FAVOR	Thanks for the great masks, @hvaleche @GreggPbc #MayorDaveKerner #RobertWeinroth #MaryLouBerger @voteMcKinlay #MackBernard. Got mine today. You're saving lives.

FAVOR	Don't be a COVIDIOT...
FAVOR	Man on train keeps removing mask to sneeze into hand . Man without mask has just got on and shaken hands with him ... I despair for humanity :mask::sneezing_face: #COVIDIOTS #facecoverings
FAVOR	Trumps cronies are now making it known that there is no negative to wearing a mask.. @realDonaldTrump finally wears a mask..its a shame its 3 months too late. You have already killed or permantly damanged half of of America ( physically, financially and mentally) 
FAVOR	@FinchleyCentra1 Just a little, they do want you to wear masks if you can, but drop them down for the lovely deaf girl. So we was served by her.
FAVOR	@transman4trump @MikeLevin Agreed nothing is perfect, but don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Bottom line, if we all wear our masks we are all significantly less likely to get sick.  Do your part and
FAVOR	At first I thought the most ridiculous reaction to COVID19 was people panic buying toilet paper... I now see it’s the refusal to wear a mask at the grocery store.  :mask:

FAVOR	@SHIFTidaho Why not “Mask-Up Idaho” I was out there for the weekend and it was absolutely disgusting. I only saw 2 employees and maybe, MAYBE 20 people protecting those around them. #maskupidaho
FAVOR	@JeffPassan @markasaxon Gee it's almost as if the MLB's plan to safeguard players, coaches and officials from a highly contagious and deadly virus with no cure isn't actually working. #COVIDIOTS #TrumpVirus #StayAtHome
FAVOR	Made my first shop visit today in months (wearing mask). Literally no one else is wearing one.
FAVOR	@HaileyHiggins @fox13 We cannot afford another economic shutdown. We cannot put those vulnerable at further risk than we can reasonably mitigate. The simple, inexpensive, and mostly effective solution that can curb the virus spread is wearing a mask in public. Stay open and help the vulnerable. 
FAVOR	@drsimonegold Instead of going on every right wing talk show and pushing dangerous ineffective compounds like some travelling quack, tell the truth.   The best way to deal with Covid-19 isn’t a drug.  It’s not contracting it in the first place.
FAVOR	Finally went out after dialing it WAY back after the shutdowns.  I’m very happy to report everyone in sight is wearing a mask, socially distancing and not a single Karen/Kevin. Still a little gun shy about being out, but I am encouraged.
FAVOR	Good morning! Wear a mask when not at home, keep a minimum distance of 6 feet as best you can, and wash your hands frequently throughout the day.
FAVOR	@CianchetteJack @TeamTrump @TrumpWarRoom @LaraLeaTrump I see a lot of robust bellies, no masks, no life preservers. You can almost feel the covid that’s inevitable. #COVIDIOTS
FAVOR	Hubs is in #Phoenix with a load. He said NO ONE is wearing masks. Makes me sad that my home state can’t get their shit together. Makes me even more mad because that’s where we caught #COVID19 back in March.
FAVOR	There are rules &amp; protocols in place for a reason. I am grateful for the scientists, doctors &amp; other experts that are way smarter than me making these calls to stop the spread. I am happy to wear a mask if there’s any chance it will protect others. It’s that simple
FAVOR	I used to laugh at people and call them babies when they complained about having to wear a mask in stores or at work. Now that I’ve had to wear one 8 hours a day for a week:  I still laugh, and they’re still babies.
FAVOR	@Hardees it’s a little disheartening that most of your employees in your Athens, Tennessee store were not wearing masks!!! Care more about your customers!!! #StopCovid
FAVOR	@fiestabuckeye1 @Sharman6642 @TheGoodLiars Not true. Also, there is currently a vaccine for the flu. Why are you trying to minimize this pandemic? People are dying every minute in this country because the federal government is leaderless and has politicized the one thing that could mitigate it.
FAVOR	Let me get this straight: you want to not only fly right now, but have the audacity to not wear a mask.  #Delta then said I’m turning this thing around like a MOTHER because y’all are acting like CHILDREN
FAVOR	@MaureenKTVU @KTVU Is there anyway to fine the @realDonaldTrump for not wearing his mask ever, or just the tax payers. #heshouldsentstandards #ohwaithedoesntlistentothedoctorsmybad
FAVOR	I live in a state with a Democratic governor. Masks in public places have been mandatory since at least June 1.  I shopped in 3 different stores today. Everybody was masked, and I didn’t hear a single “but muh freedums.”
FAVOR	What's with the no mask thing? Do you really think life saving health laws are unconstitutional? Are you saying its okay for waiters to not wash their hands before handling your food? Get with it folks! Just WEAR THE DAMN MASK #Masks
FAVOR	Wearing a mask and social distancing doesn't mean you are "living in fear." It's like wearing a seat belt or using your headlights in the rain, it's for your safety and the safety of others.
FAVOR	Just went to the gas station. The only person other than me wearing a mask was the cashier who was actually in a booth behind glass. I don't get it. The indifference is startling here.
FAVOR	@wsvn It’s not the masks  stop protesting &amp; having home parties, hotel parties, boat parties etc you see them posting all the parties through Social Media.
FAVOR	@PBS1982 @vividchi1 @Letrangerdalger @Revilopsa Your use of ‘Dr Fartzy’ speaks volumes about you.  Doctors and nurses survive long shifts in serious medical masks.
FAVOR	@GovRonDeSantis @BrowardHealth @floridachannel Allow me to save you the time-here’s what he’ll say -“...blah, blah blah, lower case numbers, blah, schools are fine, blerp, Trump calls me Eric, blah, no state mask order, blerp.”                         #DeSantisResign #DeathSantis #DeSantisLiesFloridiansDie
FAVOR	What’s wrong with people? Ware a mask and stay the heck away from others. It’s pretty easy! #COVIDIOTS #PhysicalDistancing #StopTheSpread #FactsNotFear #WashYourHands
FAVOR	If you haven’t been wearing a mask in #SanDiego yet, the air from the #Navyfire leaves you no choice now. Quality right now is very mixed. The smell is definitely potent and it can’t be good to take in and mess up the respiratory system now. #StayHome 
FAVOR	@LukaG_55 alright now there is a reason to wear a mask!!!  He’s bask @IowaHoops
FAVOR	We've either had huge numbers cured of whatever illness that prevented them from wearing masks or the stick is working.  Very noticeable increase in compliance this morning in Limerick.  
FAVOR	Morning Rebels :sunrise_over_mountains:  Im back to work full time. Back to telling people to cover their nose, back to telling people to #WearAMask #WearADamnMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
FAVOR	If you don’t wear a mask you ugly.
FAVOR	I’m not religious but this little ditty popped into my head today... Maybe this will help those who proclaim to be “Christian” with wearing a mask.    “Wear a mask and say your prayers because Jesus and Corona are everywhere.”  -
FAVOR	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO.
FAVOR	Also I’m sure since you are refusing masks, you will refuse any vaccine that comes out. I would also appreciate it if you stay the “f” away from me, my family and friends #COVID19AB
FAVOR	If you don’t care on wearing a mask, get the fuck out of streets. I’m so done being polite about this
FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why is there no plan to stop or at least slow the spread? Mask mandates, close down to phase one in hot areas, something? Testing is great, but it doesn't slow the spread.
FAVOR	@1011_News So they're willing to incur legal fees a fine, and an eventual loss of business. Cool cool. Close the joint.   #WearAMask
FAVOR	@ashleysoudah @No1TennisMum @leannebarlow1 You won’t be flying anywhere in the not too distant future then... or travelling into town. Good luck without your #Facecovering

FAVOR	@TheLalasventure @doqholliday @realDonaldTrump Houston really does have a problem at the moment, considering Mayor Turner has implemented fines if you don't wear a mask. Vote him out! #Trump2Q2Q
FAVOR	@ewarren @JillSchupp Where is your mask?
FAVOR	I have no idea if I look good in my mask. Even if I don't, I'm pretty sure I'd look worse wearing a ventilator or a coffin.  
FAVOR	@ArtfulDodgerXI @SenatorSinema Or.... you can wear a mask when going out and near other people!
FAVOR	people are so quick to be like millenial this gen Z that yet we are the ones ABIDING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 #rantover
FAVOR	@RforRingmaster @ananavarro Where I live if you serve someone without a mask the business can be fined $9000 for each occurrence. So your $7 coffee &amp; donut do not compensate the business for the risk of that loss.
FAVOR	@martingeddes I did contemplate my mask and snorkel when I travel just to show them!!!
FAVOR	@Constance8News I’m so sorry. Why is wearing a mask so hard?
FAVOR	@Constance8News So very sorry for your loss. I pray anti-maskers will get the message that masks do help save lives. #WearAMask

FAVOR	Hey @MishaBotBot Please tell me you wear a mask! Everyone, even Bots have a responsibility to help slow the spread of Covid-19.
FAVOR	@Mystere07623203 @va_shiva @Liberty13046 130,000 families know who had it. Another 100,000+ are hospitalized. I suppose you think they're all actors paid for by Soros and the Clinton foundation. 
FAVOR	@CBCAlerts So let's teach every child across this country how to be safe. Teachers, staff and students can learn together how to wear masks, space appropriately and wash hands correctly. It shouldn't be a choice. #WearAMask #WearYourMask
FAVOR	@Kr8cken @BradleyWhitford I did...  And it was at least 107° in #Tucson today  - so anyone outside the southwest can kiss my a** if they aren't wearing a mask "because it is too hot"  #WearAMask #Arizona #coronavirus
FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln I suppose there's a chance #FragileDonnie hasn't hit refresh since April. His staff probably found a good poll and made it his screensaver. #TrumpVirus #WeakPresident

FAVOR	@Reuters @WritesMore Guess they were too busy watching @FoxNewsSunday to have seen the video of the man who refused to wear a mask, tested positive, died with regret over his bad decision. 
FAVOR	Yo @Tesco did your branch in #Dundee retail park have an outing from the asthmatics teenagers institution or were the 100+ teenagers and young adults shopping maskless at 1030pm today just terrible people with stupid fucking parents?  #WearAMask
FAVOR	@1TreeSantaCruz @hossehenad @tedcruz @AmericanAir YIKES! @AmericanAir is usually my preference.  Hard N.O. If they don’t enforce their mask wearing policy!

FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Fickster69 @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd No... You're not a "bad person" necessarily... you're just... obviously... tragically... not too smart. Too easily larped. This isn't D&amp;D... a spell won't save you. Herman Cain didn't wear a mask, and now he's dead. Don't be like #HermanCain.
FAVOR	Dear Entitled White Women - Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. You are an embarrassment to white women who actually give a shit about all humans. No matter their skin color, sexual orientation, religion, or origin.
FAVOR	@KellyannePolls The longer your boss and the GOP pushes not wearing a mask the longer this crisis will linger and we’ll all suffer and STILL HAVE TO WEAR A MASK.
FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd Yes... right! @Adrieliam is judging and shaming people who don't wear masks because it endangers his health. Exactly! Now Ms Karen Larp... Was that so hard? :grin: Go reward yourself with some cake!
FAVOR	Let’s get something straight: no one is comfortable wearing a mask. I don’t wake up every morning excited to cover my face, but I do it anyways b/c it’s the right thing to do for myself and those around me. Just get with it already....#COVID19
FAVOR	When people say “ depends on your view” about wearing masks means “I don’t give a flying f@ck about your view”. #entitled
FAVOR	@acapri74 @mkraju @ChuckRossDC For the 800th time, masks protect others from YOU, not the other way around. If Gohmert had worn a mask he wouldn’t have spread it to others. Why is this is fucking hard for Americans to understand????
FAVOR	@JoeBrunoWSOC9 We can't have nice things, because we dont wear masks and follow the rules.
FAVOR	@McloedPatricia @realDonaldTrump YES, AGREE with above and also..... The UNITED STATES CITIZENS Deserve and Demanded testing so that they would know if they were sick to that could get treatment and PROTECT their loved ones and ALL AMERICANS.
FAVOR	@SaraMulcahy1 @SnowinginFL @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Yes, it does, a positive test without symptoms (Asymptomatic) can &amp; has been proven to spread the virus. Thats the importance of wearing  masks, so you dont unknowingly spread the virus. #asymtomatic  #COVID19
FAVOR	I'm 60 and I wear a mask.  My mom is 89 and she wears a mask.  Don't tell me you are too old to wear a mask.
FAVOR	@Constance8News I'm so sorry for your loss, prayers and condolences go out to you &amp; your family I lost my cousin to covid-19 day before yesterday, so I understand. People are dying as result of other people not wearing a mask. This is not a joke/hoax!!!!
FAVOR	@TVsCarlKinsella Tbh, I'll be far less mental than I am now.   I'm diabetic, and the general public are not taking this pandemic seriously enough for me to feel safe outside.  I've apparently a one in ten chance of dying if I catch Covid, so lockdown honestly sounds ideal.
FAVOR	Me: Sorry masks are now mantatory  #DearCustomer : I don't have to wear one because I'm a selfish inconsiderate jerk!  (or maybe that's just what I hear)
FAVOR	@camstewarttheoz “...believing their “right” not to wear a mask was more important than killing innocent people.  ...Dave did everything he was supposed to do and you did not.  Shame on all of you and may Karma find you all.”  :pensive:  #Covid19 #Coronavirus
FAVOR	@RunByClowns @Revegelance @luvadergolder @mark_dowling @NeilClark66 @freddie801 Relative risk management. Masks required now. Do the decent thing and wear one. It’s no big deal really, I have to wear one every day at work, and it helps protect the most vulnerable from covid19
FAVOR	Only guys with little tiny penises don't wear masks! #Masks #Mask
FAVOR	I reckon 1/3 of people have a mask on and are wearing it correctly on my train, 1/3 are wearing it around their chin and the last third haven’t even bothered to bring one with them. Why’s it so fucking hard?
FAVOR	Masks look to be part of our lives for some time to come, so it's more economical (and eco-friendly) to buy one or two cloth masks that you can wash and wear again. They're widely available (look online) and come in a huge range of patterns and colours.
FAVOR	@JohnFugelsang He's so spot on. I'm so deeply sorry for the family.  My deepest condolences. No one is wearing a mask here in Georgia.  Gas station me and the guy behind the counter.  15 others no mask.
FAVOR	@ScientistMel Also sorry that just hit my funny bone I know you dont have an opinion either way :grin:.  Also everyone #WearAMask
FAVOR	If you didn't wear a mask yesterday, today is a perfect day to put one on! I promise, I won't judge. :mask: #WearAMask
FAVOR	@sniffydogs @WJIMAM Wear a mask to protect others.... Meanwhile @GovWhitmer is fine will killing more seniors.
AGAINST	Mad the way they want you to wear masks in shops but everywhere else its sound not to. If thats the case no one should be allowed to touch stuff unless there buying it then? :thinking_face::joy:
AGAINST	Sad to think of the number of once in a lifetime events that have been lost forever. #COVID19  has a survival rate of 99.88 %   People are more likely to die in a car accident than from #COVID19 yet we are allowing a handful of "experts" to CONTROL OUR lives #StopTesting
AGAINST	@SSG_PAIN @Darkness2Light3 @TuckerCarlson @JesseBWatters @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump Let’s have a day where we all say F@ck The Masks and we all just stop wearing them.  We just finally have a day protest on Friday August 14, 2020.
AGAINST	If masks work, then why are people working from home? 
AGAINST	Just been to the Petrol station. About 50-60% not in masks! Police turned up- they just went to subway... tide is turning! #NormalPeople
AGAINST	Canceling my @PlanetFitness membership because they are now requiring everyone to wear a mask while you work out.  Hard to breathe properly while running 3 miles with a fucking mask!!!
AGAINST	@peoples_troll I never wear a mask. A male karen tried to bark at me OUTSIDE at a park. I just ignored him and laughed. I just dont engage and give them the satisfaction.
AGAINST	@CBSNews Would that be the same people still telling us to wear masks and stay home? #FakeChineseVirusCrisis
AGAINST	Introduce mandatory face masks in shops and this once hectically busy shopping centre @intuMerryHill is like a ghost town.  Its destroying the high street &amp; centres @BorisJohnson @MattHancock
AGAINST	@TPostMillennial More proof that the mask :mask: is making people into unthinking zombies.
AGAINST	Got thrown out of an amusement arcade today for not wearing a mask. Left the family in that sh*t place and went for a nice walk in the countryside instead. Most places you need to wear a mask for are not actually worth going in at all.
AGAINST	@Bluesman6178 @GovPritzker Too late! Had dinner in Chicago last week. No mask even to walk in! Was disgusted getting served by woman with dirty little germ infested face rag on her face that she kept pulling up and down off her mouth and/or nose Ewwww! Take those rags off your face people!
AGAINST	If masks are so important why is the public not made aware of the ONLY mask that will protect the wearer from covid19 - the N95 mask?
AGAINST	@dougducey @RIESTERAgency you're just holding people hostage and blaming them for something beyond anyone's control. Masks won't make the virus magically disappear. #MasksDontWork #superstition
AGAINST	@John99601526 @EntheosShines @Drrramina Your argument fails to acknowledge that hypoxia involves the body not getting sufficient levels of oxygen. It does not mean you’ll pass out. What it means is your organs aren’t getting the oxygen they need to function at an optimal level. And that includes your brain.
AGAINST	@jejquade @HealingWarrior1 @EmmaRoulstone Masks have been mandatory since May in Spain, infections are up,local lockdowns enforced. Follow that logic.  Muslim women wear full face coverings in public.The Muslim community are still suffering the greatest rate of infections in the UK   Follow that logic
AGAINST	Next time someone tells you to wear a mask, just respond with a confident "No." It's working. Stores are already realizing they can't enforce this. Politicians may not give up, but we can make their mask orders irrelevant. #NoMasks   Post your refusal story at
AGAINST	LI’m no longer going to put up w this crap with the masks at PATH MEDICAL. I had a mask on, certified by the CDC!!! And they told me I need one of the ‘other ones’. Now we’re dictating which masks you can wear? These people are sick!
AGAINST	President Trump! We are behind you! Your role is monumental! However I received an email about Patriots wearing MASKS. Nooo! It’s proven masks are UNHEALTHY. I’m a proud HEALTHY patriot &amp; we deserve the Option! Proud Healthy UNMASKED in WA. @realDonaldTrump
AGAINST	@TheRightMelissa SERIOUS QUESTION ~ If you had ONLY 7 days LEFT to LIVE your LIFE, would you STILL WEAR a MASK and AVOID your family and friends? Would you CONTINUE to STAND 6ft. apart from everyone? Would you NOT GIVE ANYONE a HUG? 
AGAINST	@SuzanneEvans1 maybe it is from the blowjob you  to a complete stranger in the parking  lot of the  grocery store gave before putting on the mask   #Stupidity #idiots 
AGAINST	@DVATW I went to Debenhams last Friday, mid afternoon. I realise they’re having problems at the moment, but in a huge shop, I counted 6 customers. Other shops are the same, numbers way down. The compulsory wearing of masks (for nothing) is killing the high street.
AGAINST	@loulahlexa @BorisJohnson Agree .. I hate seeing people wearing them . Can’t read face expressions, can’t hear what’s been said . I like to go out and do my shopping in peace , without people staring at me because I’m not wearing a mask! 
AGAINST	@ThatParentP4P @Walmart @Walmart - It’s appreciated that employees no longer enforce mask wearing, but customers should be able to shop without being harrassed by other shoppers for not wearing a mask...
AGAINST	The masks have nothing to do with health and everything to do with control #facecoverings
AGAINST	@dupjdpl @Sith_who_laughs @LouisianaGov You stay home while the rest of us LIVE LIFE WITHOUT MASK.  Y'all are a bunch of fucking sheep!   
AGAINST	Getting you used to a mask so you won't mind the burka quite so much.
AGAINST	@JudgeDewie @EmmaRoulstone Lol. Paranoid crap. Put a mask on for an illness less deadly than seasonal flu, and you'll never, ever go out of the house without one. Time to grow up.

AGAINST	@SylvesterTurner There is no need to wear a mask! There is a cure, HCQ and Zinc. Why are you pushing this hoax narrative instead of the cure? Your day will come. :scales:  #Trump2Q2Q
AGAINST	@BorisIsShite @grumpy_bull @Michael_Rowan9 @ICMdoc @lyndsay_hopkins @ShippersUnbound Your argument; anyone who disagrees doesn't have a voice, hmm nicely fascist. If lockdown is the 'only' reason, why was one not needed for previous pandemics? So to stop numbers going up, we need to lockdown forever? Strange how a simpleton can fault your logic. #KBF
AGAINST	@jenleahhh Awww yeah! Absolutely keep doing this! No masks for me or mi familia! Keep the courage, others will follow.  I didn’t wear a mask a couple days ago and I saw an older man pull down his mask and tell his wife this was bs and if I can then surely he can as well.
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto Glad to hear it! But we all know they did this because their sales went in the in the toilet! And threats of major lawsuits for infringing on HIPAA laws and rights of the people. #MasksOffAmerica
AGAINST	Popped to the off licence earlier. No mask . Karen behind me in the queue with her tshirt pulled over her nose  :  '' you not bothering, then?''  .. Me : ''Doesnt look like it'' . Karen: '' Me neither then'' ... lowers tshirt back to neck level. . I feel weirdly elated.
AGAINST	Masks vs seatbelts. I know two people who were killed in a car crash (in the same car) several years ago. Both were actually killed by their seatbelts. One was decapitated by it. (They may also have died without them but we'll never know).
AGAINST	@GovWhitmer, @gretchenwhitmer is expected to stricken her #Mask laws today, hilariously enough, this is what we need. She will keep digging herself deeper, when if she was in the real talks of Michigan, and not in her high tower of exemption. #maskoff
AGAINST	Not wearing a mask because I’m in my own greenhouse.
AGAINST	@Charbrevolution Me too. The gov are going for the social shaming tactic ‘ your mask protects me and my mask protects you’. Same nonsence as with vaccines.
AGAINST	I have just told my hairdressers a very large national chain, that I will never be using them again because they are forcing customers now to wear face masks. I will not pay you to be sufforcated and will not add to this idiocy when hairdressers are exempt from this bs
AGAINST	#Jesus Didnt Wear a #Mask and he was the son of God. Neither did the Prophet Muhammad or Bhudda.  So neither am I.
AGAINST	@RealBasedMAGA do you really believe "brown dog" is an oncologist ?  thats a typical agitator account.    anyway, please make sure the governor of Texas gets your message about the phony covid test results. this is going on everywhere. they have to keep the hoax going.
AGAINST	Just got kicked out of a doctors office for not wearing a mask, even though everyone is following social distance guidelines,  oh well, another place not to endorse.

AGAINST	@davidicke I've had enough of this madness,I've seen and heard of false covid-19 cases.What happened is our care homes to people we love, is unthinkable.Small business are going down (myself included) and more.We need to take are country back.  We need to do something now!
AGAINST	Please before arguing with me about why everyone should wear masks. Do your own research on them. The government will control you, and for that I am sorry.
AGAINST	@DJJudd @byrdinator The data shows for healthy people masks can present greater danger because of contamination.
AGAINST	Trying out @Walmart curbside grocery pickup so I won't get scolded or kicked out for #NoMask. Not sure if this is convenient or dumb. The pickup process they gave me acts like either I or the store employee is scared to death of #Covid19 #WuhanFlu #ChineseVirus.
AGAINST	@sacbee_news Thanks for the admission that masks DON'T WORK!!
AGAINST	Guess I still don’t understand: if your mask works, why are you so concerned if I don’t choose to wear one? Your mask works, right?

AGAINST	@hrkbenowen No masks are stupid anyway.
AGAINST	@realTomPappert After months of getting groceries at Walmart with no #mask, they told me they are going to start actually enforcing it now. So I finally broke down and ordered a plague doctor costume mask. There's no compliance like malicious compliance.

AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto Never not the BS vaccine they are producing. Haven’t had a clue shot in nine years since I got sick after getting one. Guess what have not had the flu in 9 yrs. #FakePandemic
AGAINST	The left knows that personal responsibility and freedom is a valid argument to not wearing a mask. That is why they turned the narrative around to protecting other people, “If you don’t wear a mask, you want OTHER people to die!”
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto End mask requirements to fake virus
AGAINST	Not SURE why the MASK people ALWAYS have to Only SEE their world thru POLITICS? Every pardon is Labeled as either a R or a D or T Party  No matter What the Topic is: Education Health Pandemic. Do you SEE how DIVISIVE that is?? Politics has Nothing do with

AGAINST	@Qpatriotsoldier @GovPritzker This is great video. Last week someone told me this woman has things wrong. I asked her what specifically was wrong. She could not answer. The mask lovers have some psych issue that is driving them to be irrational.

You're brainwashed, making the mask your escape valve It won't sort your issues Stand up tall and face LIFE as a gift!
AGAINST	@GovHolcomb Abby's is sweet &amp; Abby's parents are responsible for her. An entire state &amp; the healthy should never be told to mask up for those who may or may not need 2 stay home. Surgical/homemade masks don't stop a virus, never has, never will. Quarantining the healthy is ludicrous.
AGAINST	F your masks!  Wear one if you want but don't make me.
AGAINST	@sallyKP That is evil. That woman's mask isn't going to do much anyway. Unless she's wearing an N95 or better, what's the point? She's out in public at what seems to be a busy time. Then to say that to kids. Come on! I'm guessing she never got married, and never had kids.
AGAINST	The face is the most sensitive, revealing, uniquely human part of our anatomy  To have to walk around with a diaper wrapped around our face as if it were a source of contamination and disease - could anything be more degrading, humiliating and offensive to our humanity?

AGAINST	@CoreyBr54230981 @Surgeon_General You believe that?  It’s an arbitrary number.  No one goes into a store and stands in place.  More than 99% of your breath escapes the mask unfiltered.  2 ft or 20 ft matters not.

AGAINST	@UReinke @justjoysworld @AllenGlover53 @Jesus2016comic Well, since it is obvious you haven’t picked up a book in 42 years you should learn a few things about masks and the fact that the #CCPVirus is 125 nm in diameter and the best mask in the world will only filter out something bigger than 300 nm #MasksDontSaveLives

AGAINST	@abc7newsbayarea What if you cannot breathe through masks and have a health condition or ptsd, claustrophobia, autism, etc?  People should be exempt from masking.  We have a right to breathe air and exhale CO2 in and out of our mouths and noses.  #ReopenAmerica
AGAINST	@SenSchumer When have Dems ever done anything for the American people out of true concern for our welfare? What's your reason, Chuckie? Why do you want us all to wear masks? Why is there an apparent correlation between places that forced mask wearing and a rise in cases?

AGAINST	So let me get this straight: you have to wear a mask or everyone will die unless you’re sitting and eating or protesting, which makes the virus safe? Also, mask= safe, shirt over face=everyone dies? It’s not just that the rules are wrong, they’re arbitrary.
AGAINST	This mask thing must be a joke.  I don’t know how many people I saw @ the grocery store ￼wearing their masks just on their mouths and not over their noses and mouth.  Apparently we have two different sets of lungs ????? #Plandemic #Masks

AGAINST	@DonFitzgerald1 @fmcoreega @MsResJudicata No. The fiber of the mask has holes that are larger than the virus being carried &amp; do not protect you or others.

AGAINST	@2ndfor1st That is what most elders look like in their n-95 masks. Turns out, if you are older &amp; have breathing issues anyway, including physical restrictions like weight, it can make the mask deadly. If he leaves it on longer he could die. #oxygen
