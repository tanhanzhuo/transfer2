FAVOR	@GovAndyBeshear Would you rather have loss of JOBS or loss of LIVES on your conscious? Especially with opening schools where most kids are attending. COVID cases are going to spread more rapidly than ever. Why take the “let’s wait and see approach?”
FAVOR	#SocialDistancing is the only option to stop the spread of #COVID19. Protect yourself and your loved ones by staying at home! #IndiaFightsCOVID19  
FAVOR	When you have people listening to you (as dumb as they are). It means you need to watch your fucking mouth. COVID IS NOT A JOKE. It's not the fucking flu, it's not pnemonia. It's SARS-CoV-2 #StayAtHome
FAVOR	@AusDebater @JVartndesign @jillastark No, we have vaccines for the plague.  And antibiotics. COVID19 is a virus (antibiotics don't work) and there is no vaccine yet.  If not for modern hygiene, hospital care, ventilators and of course social distancing, this virus would be killing many more.
FAVOR	@thehill Me to 8yr old: Do you miss school? Are you excited to go back?   8yo: ALREADY?! NOOO!  Believe it or not, our kids DO love us &amp; loke being @home with us. Mine love having their dad wk from home.  And when school starts in Aug. they’ll be safe at home w/us then too.
FAVOR	@sgtfible @CristinaAlesci @Walmart If you catch COVID19 and expire because you're too stupid to wear a mask or social distance, then yeah, you probably WON'T shop there anymore. #Dumbass #COVIDIOTS #TrumpVirus #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	People who refused to #WearAMask show up sick in #Arizona hospitals desperate for help to save their lives. Suddenly it's no longer a #hoaxvirus for them. How many people did they infect? @dougducey @drcarachrist #Republicans   #Covid19 #stayhome
FAVOR	@PeterNavarro45 racist #TrumpChump #Cult45. #WhiteHouse  #CNN   #COVID19 #WearAMaskSaveALife 
FAVOR	We can get through this crazy time together but for now this is not funny it’s something to take serious it’s not right to put people or yourself in danger just because you don’t think COVID-19 isn’t real because it is real, take it seriously
FAVOR	@nytimes We have descended into a species with a 30 second attention span. Being vigilant for 2 weeks is clearly impossible. #WearAMask
FAVOR	@McAlistersDeli Right .. for 2$ less savings for staying home . #StayAtHome
FAVOR	@yotesrhungry @dougducey .@GOP #Koch #ALEC #TrumpPence #bootlicker @9thFloorAZ @The_RGA &amp; #TrumpPence won’t stop killing Americans until whole #families are televised falling dead in the streets from #coronavirus  #COVID19 kills  #SocialDistancingWorks to #SlowTheSpread  #WearMasks 
FAVOR	Good morning fam, just an ernest appeal;  1. When in public let's always mask up and use sanitizer. 2. At least a cup of ginger tea in the morning and at night. 3. Let's stay home when we can. 4. Let's continue and enhance the safe practices.  #COVID19
FAVOR	The ministry also announced 377 additional cases of recovery, bringing the total number of recoveries to 105,018. In addition, 1 new death was registered.  #QBSRadio #QBSnews #Qatar #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdates #YourSafetyIsMySafety #StaySafeStayHealthy

FAVOR	Seriously, I don't know why people thought #1 that gyms were safe &amp; #2 that they were going to stay open. Idiots can't even wear a mask correctly, or won't wear one at all.  Another mad dash for equipment again...over here? We'll keep working out in our home gym.:woman_lifting_weights_medium_skin_tone::flexed_biceps_medium_skin_tone:
FAVOR	T01- " It's not always that we need to do more but rather that we need to focus on less. "                     ••• This resilient time of the COVID pandemic in some or the other way helped all of our souls to rest and calm down to rejuvenate healthy and pure.
FAVOR	Found a whole new meaning of BC - before coronavirus! Let's fight this together, so everything we did before this retched virus can become 'after coronavirus' and only the best memories can be made:heartbeat: #StayAtHome 
FAVOR	@MortonBalthus Thanks for following! #WritingCommunity #WearAMask
FAVOR	@jpierni @donwinslow #KeepYourChildHome so your family can remain free of the #TrumpVirus.
FAVOR	@worldknowus @diprjk @kansalrohit69 @DrSyedSehrish @airnewsalerts @ANI @PTI_News @ddnews_jammu @ddnewsSrinagar @HealthMedicalE1 Exactly only Precautions can keep us safe.
FAVOR	Why is #Florida not on lock down @GovRonDeSantis ???? You Trumpian Shill #Floridacoronavirus #TrumpPandemic #TrumpVirus #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome #WearADamnMask
FAVOR	@WCTVHudak @WCTV Suspending the season is a tough solution - it is also the right one. We have to take whatever preventative steps we can to be around for each other next season. And if we are safe, we will have a next season.
FAVOR	@WVGovernor What's it gonna take to shut us down again? How many of us have to get sick and die until you realize we were IN FACT
FAVOR	Stay at home and watch your favourite Essendon finals. There are plenty to choose from! #MightyBombers
FAVOR	@ruth_wishart We are hoping to have a Scottish staycation this year. I have family in England but won't be visiting due to risks of spread. Likewise they won't be travelling north either. Plenty of beautiful places to visit in home counties for now.

AGAINST	Remember: the “experts” during the Bubonic Plague said cats DEFINITELY spread the disease, and encouraged people to kill them off. When the rats who carried the ticks proliferated from no predators, the disease ran rampant.  I bet pro-cat people were ridiculed.
AGAINST	To every person complaining about people not wearing masks:If the masks work like you claim,why did we let people out of prison and not just give them a mask? Furthermore,if you don't want to open schools,WHY?Won't the masks stop the spread? #fakenews #OpenSchools
AGAINST	@hector_drummond Far more people will die from suicide domestic violence etc than from this bullshit #Covid
AGAINST	@CMOTamilNadu  Extending lockdown is crime against humanity. Why playing drama for the disease with 2 % fatality rate.  #tamilnadu
AGAINST	Because once we get to HIT, even high-risk individuals bear little risk! And yes, COVID19 will come back each year, but each return will have materially less impact. In fact, it most likely will simply become the fifth coronavirus to cause the common cold.
AGAINST	@lynnemarierich @kylamb8 @Carrenimfa A war? A war against what? Invisible bugs?   Yeah good luck on that one. How’s the war on crime or the war on drugs going? :thinking_face:   Eat healthy, exercise, sleep, wash your hands, and you’ll be fine.  #FactsNotFear #NoMasks #nolockdowns

AGAINST	@SomeBitchIKnow Yet nothing is said about the suicide rate or starvation or just downright skyrocketing homicide rates how about experts say don’t vote Democrat because they’ll get you killed
AGAINST	We tried #lockdown before  Proved it didn't end deaths  We tried mandatory #MasksOn  Proved it didn't end deaths  Number of cases not translating to higher death rate  The experts said 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 deaths by March 2020  Proven to be wrong every time

AGAINST	@gemmaod1 With HIV virus tests . Do results show thousands of false positives? Do thousands of people get told they have HIV and then they haven't. Come on this is a scam ! Isolate and validate the virus if it exists and then create an accurate test. #sheeple #WakeUpWorld
AGAINST	@QTAnon1 @tomtjp01 I think these are animals impacted by covid.  People struggling because of shutdown means the pets we’re responsible for suffer.
AGAINST	@CNBCMakeIt All thanks to a fake pandemic.
AGAINST	@MattHancock Ridiculous. You are using number of cases to lockdown areas, when you should be using number of critical care cases or deaths. The economy is dying because of your overreaction.
AGAINST	@MartinSLewis @EndUKLockdown1 Whichever side of the fence u sit on, this lockdown is bollocksing small independent stores. Shops that rely on browsing &amp; comparing 1 shop to another. Chain stores can survive these restrictions, but social distancing is cancerous for any other types of shops.
AGAINST	@mdnij34 Angry, why I can't go out, I'll slap a Karen back to last Thursday. 
AGAINST	@TomiLahren Sheep are complacent while their rights are being trampled. Covid hysteria is about pure power.
AGAINST	@fox8news The numbers are in the government over reacted everything should go back to the way it was and the 6% of ohio in the high risk pool should stay home or wear masks or whatever #openohio
