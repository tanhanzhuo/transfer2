AGAINST	@TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Now just stop morons like Fauci from putting a damper on it for a f'ing virus with 0.04%IFR under 70.  Any state that closes again should lose all federal funding, as it damages the economy and people of the US.  #FireFauci

AGAINST	The death rate of COVID-19 is just barely causing more deaths than the flu currently, according to statistic sources that notoriously inflate COVID-19 counts.   But no, we'll keep everything locked down at least until, oh, I don't know, I'd say maybe... November
AGAINST	@GregAbbott_TX @realDonaldTrump @GovAbbott Makes NO SENSE!

AGAINST	@mamabird_31 @JordanSchachtel @ThorOdinson543 YES &amp; More testing equals more cases. Most new cases have little or no symptoms.   Number of cases is a joke.   The only measure that matters is number of deaths.   New data from the CDC states the Survival rate is now 99.7%
