FAVOR	Young people are dying in schools, please close those doors.
FAVOR	@RepRalphNorman @grahamblog @SenatorTimScott  @scsenategop #coronavirus #southcarolina Close the schools!
FAVOR	In case anyone is wondering my children will not be attending public schools in the fall. #COVID19 #schoolviolence #sexualharassment #SystemicRacism  #bullying #TeachersLivesMatter #SocialInjustice need more reasons? #backtoschool
FAVOR	Like what are we going to do if we get it, is there a cure for coronavirus? no. cancel school. We don’t want more children getting sick. @ScottMorrisonMP #Coronavid19 #coronavirus #coronavirusaustralia #Covid_19australia
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan My son has asthma and I have multiple autoimmune problems so we decided online was the way to go. A couple of weeks later @CobbSchools agreed that everyone should attend online. I for one commend them for it. It won't be easy but it is necessary! #Schools
FAVOR	tRUmpublicans think it's OK to rape, cage, starve, gun-down or expose our children to a deadly pandemic but lose their shit about abortion.  
FAVOR	@redfreedom2020 @donwinslow Taught 30 years. I can tell you that schools are a Petri dish for germs. Kids don’t follow/understand hygiene standards like adults do, and they constantly touch one another. Normally our bodies fight it off. Not with Covid.
FAVOR	we request our respected Prime Minister  @ImranKhanPTI and our education minister @Shafqat_Mahmood to announce opening of schools after Eid.
FAVOR	I don’t care about the coronavirus I just want to get out of this my dumbass school lmao
FAVOR	Teachers put in a lot of effort to conduct online class. Listen to the teacher and it's a good mode of education in the current scenario. How do we expect schools to pay them without any fees.  #SaveOurSchools
FAVOR	We must boycott our schools, and protest to have the schools shut down, due to coronavirus. It's not only threatening to us as students, but to our parents. PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THIS SITUATION ISN'T AS BAD AS IT SEEMS, YOU ARE DELUSIONAL AS FUCK!
FAVOR	@apiper13 @nowthisnews Schools aren't ready.I know when my children get sick i always quarantined them in rooms.Yet I still get it We knw It goes thru the household maybe kids are more ASymptomatic for now until it mutates again &amp; Give it to Others, Teachers,Staff it'll spreads over &amp; over.
FAVOR	@MSNBC All countries in the western world opening schools but let's see..we don't follow the science to open schools but we followed science to shut down..oh ok now that makes sense.
FAVOR	Are we going to allow our kids to be vectors of the #coronavirus and pass it to Grandma and grandpa?  Don't hate the elderly.
FAVOR	When trump says,"You don't have to wear a mask." I'm wearing a mask. When trump says"Covid is a hoax." I know it's real. When trump says"Beaches,bars &amp;casinos must open." I'm staying home.  When trump insists,"Children should go to school," during a pandemic. I shout
FAVOR	What's more important? A students education? Or the wellness of the student and staff? Closing schools for a day may work for bad weather, but not for the coronavirus. Districts all around need to open their eyes and realize one day closures do nothing to help!
FAVOR	Just close the schools and promote each and every learner i mean this education system is all about producing factory faults.
FAVOR	Grown ass people are constantly throwing temper tantrums over wearing a mask to grocery shop for 30 mins, but kids, especially non neurotypical kids, can absolutely wear a mask for 7 hours a day to go back to school while the politician's kids stay home.
FAVOR	I just don't understand why schools are opening and the outbreak is getting worse.
FAVOR	There isn’t a child on this planet who would social distance and wear a mask for SIX hours a day, 5 days a week.
FAVOR	Y'all have the highest school shooters numbers and the highest #COVID19 numbers but y'all want kids to go back to school.
FAVOR	Schools have taken a lot of effort in setting up the online classes. It's a new era of the digital world and we need to support it and not spoil it.
FAVOR	My first online class was over Skype and the first 30mins was watching a classmate document himself cooking eggs. All in all a 10/10 experience #coronavirus #StayAtHome
FAVOR	Teachers to teach our kids.  They protect them from active shooters.  Now we're asking them to risk their lives/health to free us up to go to work?  Completely crazy.  All teachers should quit if their county forces them to teach in-person. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	@JoshuaPotash @thegoodgodabove The way we'll know if @GOP really thinks it will be safe to go back to classrooms will be if they gut OSHA provisions for Workers Compensation if employees contract work related COVID19 illnesses. That would be a strike-worthy issue. #coronavirus
FAVOR	Now Cohen is getting released. Just so we keep the record straight I’d like to remind everyone Covid-19 has made prisons so dangerous that Manafort, Stone, and Cohen are not incarcerated. Meanwhile President Ding Dong is lobbying for kids to be in school.
FAVOR	What’s wrong with the corona virus. People are stocking up for an apocalypse and it’s stupid. Calm down, it’s literally a worse real story flu and why are people having a seizure over this. I’m acting like it doesn’t exist. But close the schools please
FAVOR	9/ Bottom line: If we value Black and Latinx lives, we should only open schools if it’s 100% safe to do so.   Facts are facts.
FAVOR	It my opinion schools should stay closed not just cusse of corona  
FAVOR	@MollyJongFast Children are not allowed in school if they have a contagious disease.  Letters are sent home informing parents. Just in case. Asymptomatic covid Could quickly infect the entire school. Then the community. It is foolish to contemplate opening until testing is in place.
FAVOR	@richardmarx It makes 0 sense that we send kids back to school when we still need to mask up and distance everywhere else.
FAVOR	@CDCDirector Bullshit When @SenRickScott and @realDonaldTrump send their kids and grandkids back to school instead of distance learning? Then let's  talk ... #teacherproblems #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #ReopenSchools #teacherlivesmatter #StudentsLivesMatters #distancelearning
FAVOR	@GOP We are fine with opening schools with a PLAN, mandatory masks, contact tracing, onsite testing with same day results, required social distancing. PPE for teachers, staff, janitors, etc. It requires MONEY and the do-nothing GOP will provide none of that.
FAVOR	@kurteichenwald Do not take the excuse that it's the school's decision and it's a private school. Believe that 45 should be putting pressure on his son's school to open just like he's putting pressure on public schools.  I don't care what schools open. Mine is going virtually.
FAVOR	This is tiring, those parents who says kids are safe at schools should just bring them once, and hope their funeral covers and policies are up to date...mine will be at home!!!
FAVOR	#PostponeJEE_NEETinCovid We Wont give exams until our parliament is closed and until there is no vaccine. As WHO says covid has become airborne and can travel upto 15 feet, so socil distancing will be a joke at the examination centres.teenagers are at higher risk
FAVOR	Don’t Experiment on our kids @GovTimWalz! Open Schools, Op Minnesota!
FAVOR	Children can't maintain social distancing!
FAVOR	I've made a big discussion today and that my 3 children will not be going back to school until the #coronavirus is under control or there is a vaccination for it....
FAVOR	Reopening schools this fall as if everything is normal is stupid.  Students, teachers and staff are worth protecting.  Im not willing to send my kids into harms way for trumps ego.
FAVOR	Parents have the power, by simply pulling all your kids out of school, all schools will shut down!
FAVOR	Schools should just be closed,the 2020 curriculum will continue once the vaccine is found,even if it means 2020 curriculum get done in 2021-2022,we’ll have to adjust &amp; catch-up at some point.
FAVOR	@therecount Sending children to school during a deadly #COVID19 pandemic, is worse than putting your children in cars without seatbelts.  It's playing Russian Roulette with the lives of children.   It's child abuse.   #StayHome
FAVOR	We know we can’t open schools safe 138,000 people dead from a virus our government failed to protect us from @BetsyDeVosED SCREW OFF
FAVOR	@ossoff Well, the reopening of schools should go smoothly. I was told that anyone with a fever can return to school 24 hours after it breaks. There’s no testing, not even a doctor’s note required for staff and students to return.   #NotMyKid
FAVOR	4) We as Sadtu want schools to close because psychosocial services that is needed now urgently to mitigate against the anxiety has not been effected as earlier commited by the Minister
FAVOR	My family is living in fear because my brother is going to college with two staff members who interacted with someone who passed away due to the coronavirus. And yet they won't close the school? Why? Don't you want to protect the students?
FAVOR	I’m homeschooling this year. Not risking my daughter over someone who doesn’t understand wind and thinks the enemy is a friend.
FAVOR	And yes, I've decided to homeschool &amp; I know that's not an option for everyone, but it's very blasé to say "Just keep your kid home" because those kids &amp; teachers will be spreading it to their families &amp; others &amp; into the community. Reopening schools is a big mistake.
FAVOR	I’m absolutely scared silly about this coronavirus. I want to batten down the hatches and keep my babies home till it blows over #COVID2019uk
FAVOR	@donwinslow Even though my 4 kids are adults, our oldest is a teacher. There is absolutely no guidance in place now. Schools open in less than a month. I worry about her and her students.
FAVOR	If #NYCSchools reopen before #COVID19 is under control, then assuming the .1% fatality rate is correct for children, ages 4-18, then the death rate of students in #NYC will be 1,127 (rounded) based on current enrollment.  #Coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic
FAVOR	Sooo.. #COVID19 is so contagious we release inmates from prison...but safe enough that we can send our children back to school.  Dangerous enough that we're still on lockdown. But safe enough to jeopardize the lives of our babies?  #IRefuse #SendBaron
FAVOR	Donald Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and kill a million schoolchildren via #COVID19 and not lose any #MAGA voters..
FAVOR	@T_R_0_V_3_R @repairrestores1 We all know that opening schools during a raging killer pandemic is criminal and crazy.
FAVOR	@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan, millionaire white Republican, has 3 kids: Liza Ryan, 18, Charles, 17, and Samuel Ryan, 15.  I wonder if he will be sending them to school in a few weeks. He’s made no statement condemning the decision by his party to reopen schools. #GOPkids #notmykid
FAVOR	Homeschooling is the best way ever!
FAVOR	The question is not whether NYC schools will shut down. They will. For sure. The questions is how many #coronavirus cases do we need to get to for our leaders to decide to close them. @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo
FAVOR	@MegaRacismHater @AdamSchefter Good. The whole league should do the same ... keep the schools closed too!
FAVOR	@GaHospitalAssoc @GaDPH @GovKemp Better yet #StayHomeSaveLives #ShutGADown
FAVOR	@TelanganaToday can you please look after schools which are not closing even after the government orders. Kangaroo kids begumpet and chirec are still working for teachers.Please seal the schools. #coronavirus #telanganatoday
FAVOR	I am a parent. And a bad teacher. And I am anxious about schools in fall. #schoolsreopening #pandemic #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	D'ya know why Trump has a boner about opening schools? So parents go back to work &amp; he can claim a revitalized economy for election. Trump is willing to bet your kids lives to WIN An Election.
FAVOR	@TeaPainUSA I think the kids who get COVID-19 at school should go to @GovParsonMO's home until they get over it.   #COVIDIOTS  #ProtectOurKids
FAVOR	Everyone is worried for the students but don’t forget about teachers too! Most teachers are of an older age which leaves them more vulnerable to COVID-19
FAVOR	Schools will perfectly help me spread. - The Virus:microbe:
FAVOR	I didn’t realize DT maliciously hid the CDC recommendationthat NO SCHOOLS should open. How can anyone in education ignore experts? Hoping school districts send a clear message to politicians NOT to play politics w/our children. This is not a good experiment.
FAVOR	@CDCgov  no longer gets data. It goes to the White House. Great. The country we relied on to keep us safe and that said the virus is a hoax. Now has contol over the numbers we see. And he wants schools open
FAVOR	Ya know, people always say that “the children are our future”. Then bitch, why are you sending your future into the most dangerous place to be during a global pandemic?? choices. 
FAVOR	You must close the schools for a period of time corona virus infected many people, do it now u don’t want to be like Italy
FAVOR	@DWUhlfelderLaw Yes!!  Thank you!  I’m a Florida mom and friend to many teachers who are scared to death. @GovRonDeSantis is a freaking idiot, a dangerously negligent and incompetent idiot!
FAVOR	We have to wait for somebody to actually get the coronavirus in our school for us to close? Shouldn't we be closing the schools to prevent the spread of this?are schools that desperate for money to the point that they will wait for somebody to get infected?
FAVOR	Who is Angie Motshega if @WHO has said it is not safe for schools to reopen during the spike of the pandemic. Parents let's not take our kids to schools WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT
FAVOR	Either you win by dismantling the corrupt school system, or you win when the science is all of a sudden on your side and its ok to open schools. What do you think sir?  #homeschool
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @Sept11Memorial How about $2 million for a memorial for all the people you killed with your COVID-19 conspiracies, incompetence, and nonstop lies? Or should wait until you’ve annihilated all of our children for the sake of your stupid fucking economy?
FAVOR	Anyone who thinks kids will respect social distancing rules and stick to strict protocols about behavior, hallway interactions, bathroom breaks, riding the bus, and eating lunch hasn’t spent more than ten minutes in a school. 
FAVOR	Attention, the Coronavirus, aka COVID-19, is almost at my city so schools for us will close soon.. :scream::scream::scream:
FAVOR	Ive been angry about the way @KCPubHealth &amp; @CDCgov handling schools #COVID19seattle HUGE burden placed on kidsw/medically vulnerable family or are medically vulnerable themselves. Miss school OR risk infecting those they love. @GovInslee @WADeptHealth #COVID19
FAVOR	i have the option to do online or in class and you already know i’m sure as hell not going back so i can avoid everyone’s annoying asses
FAVOR	Recall: Indians(Native Americans now) were forced to send their kids to schools on othe side of the State (SD) where diseases spread through the schools.Parents didn't know if they were going to get their kids back.Some called it genocide. My aunt was a teacher there.
FAVOR	Why are we closing schools after a diagnosis of #COVID19? Surely by then the proverbial horse has bolted and they may have infected other students or teachers.?#COVID19Aus
FAVOR	In my opinion, we should have home school or distance schooling for our children. It’s not just the Corona Virus we need to worry about, but violence. Our kid’s will be picked on or beaten on just because of skin color! Bullying will increase.
FAVOR	Why are the UK schools not closing?? It's absolutely ridiculous! What are you gonna do if one of your students die and it's your fault. Will you even care? It's 2020, any work we do at school we can find online! It makes no sense! #coronavirus @saddleworth_sch
FAVOR	@NYCSchools won’t close because parents can’t afford to lose working hours or will struggle to find childcare and some students eat their main meals at school. The system is broken and ultimately there may be some serious consequences down the road. #COVID19
FAVOR	@meralee727 Please, parents, speak up- call your board of education, your superintendent. YOUR voices are the only voices that matter to the decision makers. “Recommended distancing when possible” is NOT an answer to how schools will keep everyone safe. #NotMyKid
FAVOR	@eugenegu And he wants to force schools to reopen.
FAVOR	I guess my school thinks that there are too many students. So they aren’t canceling school, and allowing like 3000 kids who shove their fingers in each others mouths to come and wipe their grubby ass hands all over the building. Imma stay home #coronavirus
FAVOR	Several of my @SUNYRockland students are afraid &amp; anxious to be on campus. I told them I respect their concerns &amp; am OK with them going virtual, as long as the Chair &amp; Dean are notified. @SUNYChancellor @SUNY @rockhealth @InsideRockland @Rockland_News #COVID19
FAVOR	someone in a college close to my school was diagnosed w the coronavirus but i’m gonna have to wait until someone In my school gets it before it closes? can y’all not see this literally means waiting for someone to get it when it could be avoided?
FAVOR	so our school canceled school for a day so we could go support the basketball team, but reinstated it after corona virus concerns??? show me where that makes sense
FAVOR	Youre telling me in my school of 3000 kids I need to wait till someone gets diagnosed with Coronavirus before we are closed for a few days. Cuomo and de blasio are jokes liars and theives
FAVOR	People who don’t understand accountability, think they can never do the wrong thing. Be accountable, do right for our kids, teachers and schools
FAVOR	Social distancing in a classroom would require a room the size of a football field and no playtime. @ScottMorrisonMP, why do you insist on putting my wife (teacher) at risk??? #coronavirus
FAVOR	In arguing for his shift to online-only class, Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand said America had failed to effectively fight the coronavirus. “The numbers don’t lie,” he said.  #OpenFCPS
FAVOR	@WalshFreedom Gotta say, my daughter loves online school because she’s not being made fun of everyday &amp; her mental health has improved so much her Dr. thought she should continue even if they opened the schools up.
FAVOR	@librarianjennie I’d feel better if we could get covid tests, close ALL the schools in my area and close the restaurants. I don’t see that happening here:weary: #marin #coronacalifornia #coronavirus
FAVOR	@SRuhle just now a horrible story abt 82 kids contracting #COVID__19 at camp, despite all the precautions and being sent back home to 10 dif states, weaponising children to spread #COVID__19 , go ahead open schools
FAVOR	schools that are not closing right now is insane to me... are ppl WAITING for someone to get coronavirus and then close? i understand that there are some obstacles with closing but there has to be solutions out there. i shouldn’t be going to school tomorrow!
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump If the White House is closed to tours and businesses cannot safely fully reopen, schools should not reopen!
FAVOR	I don’t even HAVE a child, and I understand that is imperative we keep schools closed until it is safe for students, teachera and staff. This shouldn’t be hard to grasp.
FAVOR	@Super76x Thank goodness! Protect your babies at all costs Chris. You cannot rely on this administration and the #COVIDIOTS to make decisions! I stand behind you and all parents 100% :punch:
FAVOR	Social distancing is just a beautiful theory, learners when you turn your back they don’t practice it nor wear masks. Even teaching is not conducive, how do you avoid touching learners scripts?. Even marking class tests?
FAVOR	@LgFski @BruceBourgoine So what? So what? Yeah, sure, what's a year in a child's life?   What will happen to the schools and teachers - the entire communities, for that matter?  And oh yeah, not one person under 30 has dies because of #COVID19 #mepolitics
FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED u are such a disgusting, disgraceful, ignorant, lying, useless piece of crap! The fact that u would send your own grandchildren back 2 school let alone any child makes complete sense 4 the type of heartless person u are. #COVID19 #coronavirus 
FAVOR	@FallonTonight I hope you’re going to ask @NYGovCuomo to explain his plan to kill 300 NYC school children by reopening the schools in the midst of the first wave of a global pandemic.
FAVOR	@trudykeil We don't know if many kids will be crippled for life by the plague yet. In 20 years we'll probably have a good idea about how seriously we should have kept kids safer at home for another year until the vaccine will hopefully be available.
FAVOR	Cases continue to rise why should we reopen schools when we have states reverting back to Phase 1 and/or contemplating another shutdown
FAVOR	@MotherJones Decisions to send children and teachers back to school is being made by adults in quarantine. Repeat that.
FAVOR	@NahasNewman Thank you for this!As a teacher, I have been looking at a little of this data, but I haven't seen this much all together.The schools here are planning on opening in some capacity and this data helps me with any fears I might have had.I'll definitely be passing it on
FAVOR	@mosalty @UFT @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @DistCouncil37 @FollowCSA @SenSchumer @AFTunion The entire premise is wrong. There is NO way to teach in full PPE. There is NO way kids keep masks on for 7 hours. Has anyone talking about these things EVER stepped foot inside a classroom to teach??
FAVOR	@7News Entering schools and leaving schools. No guessing its not possible to social distance while at school.
FAVOR	Either way even if they actually do open it . It’s going to be close in less then 2 weeks . My school can’t even control fights they Think they can control Covid and new rules :clown_face::clown_face::clown_face::clown_face::clown_face:
FAVOR	I understand the importance of education, but doesn't safety come first? We have already had many scares with corona virus cases on campus but we keep out schools open? Are we waiting for an outbreak? Come on Colorado.
FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln Coronavirus is too dangerous for Paul Manafort to stay in jail, but they expect our kids to go back to school.
FAVOR	School nurse when kid gets Coronavirus: here's some ice
FAVOR	This is why so many parents are against this blanket decision by  @CMOGuj . Children want their schools - online for now till they can run into them again. They miss their teachers and imagine what you will do to them when they will not have schools to return to?
FAVOR	@jaygirl1980 So many educational 'categories' of students classified 'special needs.' Vary by state. Learning disabled to multiply 'handicapped' &amp; so much more. Some are more physically vulnerable to COVID. If schools accept some, how to tell parents NO to others? No easy answers.
FAVOR	@Acosta The science should be the only thing that matters to reopen schools
FAVOR	#AngieMotshega @CyrilRamaphosa @Lesufi close the schools until after the peak period of #COVID19SouthAfrica infection rates, this Karim guy who leads your scientific advisory committee is working for @BillGates; Save the lives of our people
FAVOR	Our teachers aren't covid bouncers. These must happen: 1. Getting real PPEs' used by front line staff in hospitals not just the sanitizers and only two masks. What nonsense is that. 2. DBE should insure that classrooms have correct ventilation
FAVOR	@aging_collins @donwinslow No, its a really simple visual demonstrating that our children and families are at risks. None of the people advocating for schools opening have children who will be impacted by this. Trump, DeVos, Pence...
FAVOR	@JustinAHorwitz @ReallyAmerican1 Science should not stand in the way of opening our schools. But I guarantee you, this virus will shut them down permanently.
FAVOR	What @realDonaldTrump and @BetsyDeVosED are orchestrating by opening schools is a veritable human sacrifice on the altar of commerce, which benefits the 1% but is paid entirely by the lower classes.
FAVOR	Okay so coronavirus is spreading very quickly and there are 600 cases in the USA so schools or campuses have to be closed or its going to affect all of us it’s not even safe to go anywhere near a crowd so pls do something we need answers!
FAVOR	#Fauci if we're not to gather in large groups, why are schools still open? If we can't do same things as months ago, why are we endangering our kids still? #coronavirus #COVID19
FAVOR	My high school child will not go back to school on August 18th, with the rise in #COVID__19 cases. I worry for her teachers, classmates, and people that they may bring covid home today. @GavinNewsom is failing to lead and protect schools.
FAVOR	The colder it becomes the higher the level of Covid-19 cases rise...our children aren’t coping at all. Although the curriculum has to be covered mara not like this,come on now! Most of the learners are in hospitals right now, so what’s the use grand sharp?
FAVOR	@jaketapper Science is NOT on the side of reopening brick and mortar schools!!
FAVOR	When my 5 yr old nephew sees a mask in our hands he asks if we're going somewhere, he reminds his big brothers to bring a mask when they leave the house. He's adapted. He was excited to start school this year, but I'd rather homeschool all of them than send them in.
FAVOR	@LeanneManas @SakinaKamwendo Nollen at Madibogo :I think the government must close the schools for this year : and rebuild the schools, toilet furniture books ,and and and
FAVOR	@joshi_speaks @zoneanthony @anubha1812 I think best option for parents who are not satisfied with online classes is to shift to government schools or take a drop of one year. Many parents are happy with the online classes and let them take the advantage of it.
FAVOR	@CBSNews @FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump SCHOOLS MUST BE CLOSED! Classes must be virtual! You get tested twice or more daily! Anyone who will be near you MUST BE TESTED! School staff, faculty, teachers, &amp; children doesn’t have that privilege! More people/children will die  @BetsyDeVosED
FAVOR	Trump &amp; Gubner Abbott want schools 2 reopen. Every local ISD here is getting *at least* a 5% budget CUT. How exactly do they expect this 2 work?  #TexasCovid19
FAVOR	@RepLeeZeldin No testing plan = No school.
FAVOR	I can tell u for free, @MYANC have so many tenders linked to schools, closing schools will mean closing thier Pockets, They rather see teachers and children with chronic illness dying of Covid-19 than losing thier bite on the 500 billion relief package.
FAVOR	The shortsightedness of some people is astounding, and their fealty to Trump, disheartening.   #LetSanityRule #NotMyChild #coronavirus  #schoolsreopening
FAVOR	@GOP Look what happened in Israel when they opened schools. And they had Covid under control at the time. It's fucking raging here.
FAVOR	@MotherJones A study of 39 families. What a joke to base opening schools on.
FAVOR	...technically closing schools would stop the spread of the corona virus sooo, what do ya say school system? close the schools.
FAVOR	as someone who is autoimmune, i do NOT want to be catching coronavirus... but of course the schools don't care about it :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
FAVOR	@NYGovCuomo But you DO kill children and educators by sending them into crowded schools in the middle of a viral pandemic. Your legacy: "The Governor Who Killed The Children"!
FAVOR	@AliNouriPhD @UROCKlive1 When I read this I can’t help but conclude that opening schools is the worst possible thing we could do.
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn Schools won't be safe until the virus is under control. You are a ghoul.
FAVOR	So the occupants son , Baron’s private school won’t be open, but he wants to send your kids to school. Stop being stupid people. He will put your kids in danger, but not his.  #noschool #Covid_19 #coronavirus
FAVOR	Dear Mme Angie, please note that only 6 Grade Rs out of 90 came to school today. Please tell me why are you still sending kids to school?
FAVOR	Not only schools - the whole country must shut down!  We are all dying daily by the numbers!   We must unite to flatten the curve again!   COVID-19 is real - we need to unite! :raised_fist_medium-dark_skin_tone:
FAVOR	@thekenshain @TheJLV Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"
FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump Opening schools in hotspots will force these children to kill their parents and grandparents. #Trump and the #GOP will have blood on their hands.
FAVOR	You know the best solution if public school systems refuse to close down, to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for every parent and child call in sick.  Even if your child is not sick, someone will be if schools remain open during this pandemic.
FAVOR	I don't care that I have to go to school, I just prefer not to catch a disease that, even though because I'm a child and the survival rate with #COVID19 with children is high, could be brought home to my house and kill my parents. I know it's unlikely, but still.
FAVOR	Sickening to hear that @BorisJohnson and @Conservatives are putting staff and students at risk by not closing schools. It is clear that you care more about money than you do the people #coronavirus
FAVOR	@GOP Trump and Republicans WONT EVEN ALLOW THE CDC to give America guidelines to reopen schools. Republicans won’t fund what schools need to be safe. 138,000 deaths aren’t enough? You want to sacrifice our kids too?
FAVOR	@donwinslow @Fythia Trump wants schools open so he can say things are opening up. Trump thinks that opening schools and opening the economy will help his re-election bid. Trump does not think about the children at all.
FAVOR	@twobluecats I couldn’t agree more! #DeVosKillsChildren #DeVosMustGo #KeepSchoolsClosed
FAVOR	They shouldn't open the school.. keep it online and donate some laptops and some wifi.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump It's too dangerous to hold the RNC, but let's send students and teachers back to school  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
FAVOR	@W7VOA @GOPconvention Children over age 10 have been shown to transmit the virus at the same rate as adults.   There are a whole lot of kids age 10-18 that are going to carry the disease all through their schools and out into the communities. #GOPDeathCult
FAVOR	I will be homeschooling my son if our district doesn't offer an online option.  I won't be sacrificing anyone for Trump's reelection campaign or the economy.
FAVOR	@liloakers @AliciaG19789176 @ThePantherBlacL @PostPunkBarbie @ThisCrazyLife3 @DHSCgovuk It seems the whole world is social distancing other than schools in the #UK. You couldn't make it up. I can't see teachers going in myself. #CoronaVirusUpdates #COVID19 #coronavirusuk #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus #closeschoolsuk
FAVOR	They turning a blind eye till their own are infected and can feel what it's like. Shut the flippen schools maaaaaaan :rage::rage:. You've destroyed innocent families :rage::rage:
FAVOR	“Students need to return to the classroom so their parents can return to work.” -Donald Trump  “Kids are actually stoppers of the virus." -Betsy DeVos  THIS is who decided to reopen schools.   These 2 liars are okay risking OUR kids’ health &amp; lives. #NotMyKid
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @CNN No testing. No tracing. No back to schools!
FAVOR	All the educated people are supporting #OnlineEducation under these circumstances. The ones who are opposing it only shows how illiterate they are. Not their fault, they didn’t get good schools. And the same will happen if kids today don’t get quality education.
FAVOR	Oh, it’s going to be “a safe reopening of the schools.”   We can all stop worrying. Donald Trump says it will be safe, so it will be safe because he says so. When has he ever been wrong before?  What is his strategy? That it will be safe. Simple.    #TrumpsAmerica
FAVOR	@Morning_Joe @Laurie_Garrett There are bus stops for all kids in public school, they can be used to deliver &amp; distribute take-home meals daily for kids while schools are closed.
FAVOR	Republicans: "All lives matter!"  *is asked to wear a mask for the sake of others*  Republicans: "No, not like that!"  #notmykid
FAVOR	I live in King County, two towns from the epicenter of COVID-19  Schools are open but 1/2 full  At elem schools, kids sneeze, spit when talking, eat from a salad bar &amp; might be carriers w few symptoms  CLOSE, subsidize needed school lunches &amp; send teachers home
FAVOR	Trying to figure out how a govenor “can’t” mandate masks, but is saying schools MUST open in person @henrymcmaster #Hypocrite #sceducation @SCforEd #teacher
FAVOR	@w_terrence This is better... @pantomath__ The U.S. saw its highest single day of new COVID-19 cases today, with 71,135 cases reported.   And Trump is concerned about Reopening schools
FAVOR	Maybe it’s time to find a new job. This certainly doesn’t feel like a career anymore. #TeachersAreNotMartyrs
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan My two sons, two kids each will not be sending their kids.  One son is a high school teacher whose school will continue on zoom.  His union will strike if told to return.  #SchoolReopening #schools
FAVOR	@MercerYou I could not be more disappointed. As a public health professional taking night classes your decision to remain open in a serious pandemic puts me and everyone else at great risk. You should be ashamed!! #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #PublicHealth
FAVOR	Close schools , put teachers on unpaid leave and let them apply for TERS like private school teachers
FAVOR	Someone in my town has CoVID-19 and they have yet to cancel school.
FAVOR	Trump and the Republican party- abortion is a sin and it's murdering babies. Also Trump and the Republicans- We are completely reopening schools this fall and we don't care if kids die due to the virus. The hypocrisy here.
FAVOR	@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump So when are you, Trump and the GOP going to care about keeping kids safe?
FAVOR	How much do you think a jury would award a family in punitive damages from a school district for the #Covid19 death of a teacher, student, cafeteria worker that was forced to go to school because Trump is a fucking idiot?
FAVOR	I never thought id see the day where #Conservatives and #Libertarians are wanting #PUBLICSCHOOLS to open. FUCK public schools! #COVID__19 #SaveTheChildren
FAVOR	@DanielAndrewsMP CLOSE THE SCHOOLS! Back to remote learning until the cases drop. What would you rather; the cases to drop, or the people to drop...dead, because of Coronavirus? Schools cannot contain and maintain this pandemic. #COVID19 #Coronavirus
FAVOR	A parent asked reason 4 stopping online lrng. I explained to him the entire situation &amp; he said,' What about parents who r willing 2 pay fees? And why shouldn't we? The situation is not created by schools, it's affecting entire wrld, then why do u hv 2 suffer?'
FAVOR	I'd rather a child be held back a grade than to wipe out their immediate family members with this contagion. #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus #Covid19
FAVOR	My kid refused to go to school today and I was also not gonna take her even if she wanted to  Schools must be closed   #MoneyHeist  #mbali  ##SchoolMustClose
FAVOR	I want my kids out of school now. If coronavirus comes into this home it will be through the petri dishes where they spend their daylight hours.
FAVOR	@wnpr Why are we just accepting schools reopening as inevitable?   “Science should not stand in the way of schools reopening.” -Someone who is not sending her own kids to school #NotMyKid
FAVOR	@donwinslow POS in Chief promised to protect us. That promise should have included our children, teachers, and everyone who works in our schools. Not just the 1%. But the smart ones knew. And we voted for Hillary.
FAVOR	@PamKeithFL @ACLU Florida does NOT meet re-open criteria.  Schools do NOT pass the 3 C's  Closed Spaces, Close Contact, Crowded Areas.   Since Florida Fails the CDC guidelines it is my duty as a Parent to say MY CHILD will not be in a "brick and mortar" school.  #FloridaCovidEpicenter
FAVOR	Please tell the government to shut down schools and pay teachers without bringing up the child support grant as if it's not important yona. I don't understand why people always attack people who earn grant, it's for kids, they are innocent they need it.
FAVOR	Hit like if you want schools to shutdown.
FAVOR	“A major teachers union in Los Angeles says the district can’t re-open schools until there is a ‘moratorium’ on charter schools."   With good reason. Charter schools do not protect teachers, refuse troubled students, drain money and talent from our school system.
FAVOR	Schools must shutdown I'm not sending my child to school
FAVOR	All these parents claiming their kids won’t wear masks if schools open...Okay, then kids can bring peanut butter to school again because all death options matter. Schools should not open!  #COVID19 #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	France: 15-day lockdown Spain and Italy: indefinite lockdown Germany and Canada: closed borders EU: about to ban all travel for 30 days  ...UK: hmm, well, yeah, could you please like try and not spread coronavirus guys x  #CoronavirusOutbreak #SchoolClosure
FAVOR	Quoting Sadhguru, edited for this context - "No one is expecting Online Education to be perfect, but Schools are constantly striving to be better; in the best way possible under these circumstances to bridge the GAP in learning. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS."
FAVOR	@DanCrenshawTX Don’t reopen schools in the fall. Protect your children from a failed government and the deluded sycophants that continue to support it.
FAVOR	Pro lifers:  Life begins at conception We must protect all those babies  Also pro lifers: Send the kids to schools or defund them! We know we’re in the middle of a pandemic and some may not make it, but we have to take the chances.
FAVOR	To all of the Anti-Masker Moms:  Not being able to see your infected child, or infected spouse infected by your infected child while on a ventilator really sucks. But you know what sucks worse?  Casket &amp; urn shopping. #WearAMask
FAVOR	Is wrong with this picture? You need to get off your butt and force the mask mandate and quit kissing the failing #individual1’s butt. Newton county just had another death and you want to force our children to go to schools?
FAVOR	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this.
FAVOR	@seanmdav If Malls are not opening because of concerns with recirculated air #Ventilation HVAC systems spreading Coronavirus. Schools with sealed windows, interior classrooms, &amp; the same recirculated air ventilation that fans #Coronavirus around shouldn't open.
FAVOR	@ASlavitt No school is worth attending if it means your kid’s/kids’funeral, memorial service or cremation will be held w/in about 3 wks, more or less because of it!   #COVID19
FAVOR	If you fail to protect a child that is called neglect. Any parent that sends their child back to school in the middle of this #TrumpVirus should be charged accordingly. I would be in jail, no way in hell would I put mine in known danger. #schoolsreopening #COVID19
FAVOR	Dear President @CyrilRamaphosa, I'm a teacher who has tested positive for  COVID-19. Please shut down schools to protect our children. Economies can be revived, not lives #COVID19 #PresidentialImbizo
FAVOR	WHY doea Trump want to kill teachers, caregivers, parents and staff? Kids with special needs? Like Trump cares about child abuse? We have seen your pictures. The neglect of your children. #msnbc #TrumpPressConference
FAVOR	I challenge @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @BetsyDeVosED  to attend schools 5 days a week, 7 hrs a day when schools reopen. Come on in, sit in a desk, use the kids' restrooms, navigate the crowded halls, ride the bus, sit in the cafeteria if it's so safe.
FAVOR	It's not just about #Gujarat It's about the entire nation. We need to save schools throughout India. We need to protect the rights of every child in India. No school in any state, no teacher in any state and no student in any state should be  left behind.
FAVOR	I think I sorta get this now, I’m for waiting until after Labor Day to send kids back to school if that’s okay. Still if people can wear a mask or stay home then this whole pandemic will end. So please stay home or wear a mask.
FAVOR	I don’t get why we are waiting for coronavirus to get to our campuses before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the campus so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it
FAVOR	If Harvard is still doing distant learning, then we all should be distant learning. #CoronavirusUSA
FAVOR	Something I keep thinking about... look at all the people that refuse to wear masks in public, even when mandated by the state. Are they going to tell their kids not to wear one in school? Yep. So do schools turn them away? Not let them on the bus?
FAVOR	@CBSNews Send your kids to public schools first.
FAVOR	@KateBrownForOR Yes! This should include educators being asked to return to the classroom in the middle of a pandemic that is not under control. Schools must be online only until we have testing and tracing fully in place. #teachersareessential #WeStandTogether4SafeSchools #NotMyKid
FAVOR	When @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany was pushing @realDonaldTrump's agenda to reopen schools, did I really hear her say, “The science should not stand in the way of this"?  Or am I drunk, high, in a coma...?  #kayleighlies #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpKillsUs  #MAGA
FAVOR	Y’all can go ahead and open the schools. My kid will just stay home. :middle_finger_medium-light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	Why are schools still open????? Mr President you and your cabinet are bloody clueless
FAVOR	uh why wait until someone gets the coronavirus..? Rather be safe than sorry
FAVOR	@realTiffyCat @scdhec I pray that SCDHEC stays transparent. I heard today that our incompetent governor is directing SCDHEC to change the way they report their numbers. to not give people enough information, so McMaster can do Trump’s bidding in opening our schools without restrictions.
FAVOR	As a teacher i really dont like the fact that parliament is closed and we are expected to go to school and  be exposed to dangers of covid-19 everyday. This is like sending your chicken to the dogs, while u watch the show and relax:lying_face::lying_face:
FAVOR	@thomaskaine5 COVID cases down to next to nothing Safe vaccine Effect treatment for those who get it  Then and only then can we talk. Until then #notmykid
FAVOR	@piersmorgan Not enough I fear.  Gov prefers to be reactive, rather than proactive Now COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic I think we should close the schools to help slow the spread of infection. We’re in a better position to do it than other countries. So we should do so.
FAVOR	so british schools will shut down after 2cm of snow but not for the coronavirus which is otherwise going to affect 70% of our population at least? makes sense
FAVOR	The Pharma Executives testifying about the "vaccine" live = They have said that they are concerned about sending children back, even after the vax, because we don't know the Pediatric implications yet. - BIG PHARMA IS WORRIED. Let that sink in for a sec. #COVID19
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan I have no children but am friends with numerous teachers and librarians. Although they desperately want to return to schools, they don't think returning now will do anyone ANY favors. They are also outraged that the fed did NOTHING to stop or plan for this.
FAVOR	Coronavirus has shut down all private universities across NYC, but all CUNY schools are still open. This is wildly irresponsible considering CUNY students are lower income, &amp; more likely to not have insurance. This is what a war on the poor looks like.
FAVOR	@JoeBiden So again, you're going to ignore what's happening in Portland, OR how unauthorized Federal agents are abducting citizens and detaining them without cause? Or are we supposed to also forget that you are in favor of opening schools back up? #PortlandUnderSiege
FAVOR	@RichieMcGinniss @JackPosobiec Look at how young they all are.  No wonder they don’t want schools to reopen.  These kids would have to be in class. @realDonaldTrump   Also, I don’t think this is 6’ social distancing.  Anyone got CV #s in this city?
FAVOR	Parents are actually going to have to parent their own children with schools closed...yet we have a generation with limited parenting skills, where others have raised their children from nursery and they’ve not had health - 1 #StaySafeStayHome #coronavirus
FAVOR	When you want you’re school to cancel classes but then you realize you’re from Ohio :clown_face::smiling_face_with_3_hearts::smiling_face_with_3_hearts: #SUNY #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak
FAVOR	Hey @RepValDemings what are you doing to help central Florida teachers in @OrangeCoFL to stay safe this school year? @JerryDemings doesn’t seem to want to take responsibility for closing the county and keeping kids and teachers safe.  #COVID19
FAVOR	waiting until we have the first case of Covid-19 in the @NYCSchools is the height of stupidity! @NYCMayor should close the schools now, before anyone tests positive and spreads it through their school and on the buses/subways.  #CoronavirusOutbreak
FAVOR	@Youtube01829362 @_Azriell_ @CharlesMunn1 @MadDemSocialist @LevonSiler Are you a teacher? You think that will happen? It will not. Children tend to not listen in school from my Teaching pre-3rd then older 7th. I can't get behind your logic at all. Teacher will spend the day Keep your masks on wash your hands..not so close..unbelievable.
FAVOR	@fred_guttenberg @donwinslow @JoeBiden It's not only about children. It's also about what they are going to bring home. It's also about adults, parents, esp. grandparents and so on. Look at Israel. They opened the schools and next thing was an explosion of cases among children AND adults.
FAVOR	literally everyone at my school is sick. everyome. maybe jot with the corona virus but everyonen is sick, coughng, sneezing, literally everywhere.
FAVOR	@Sometyme1 @donwinslow From my understanding, they are happy to sacrifice OUR children because many of these people don’t have their children in public schools. If they did, they might be more sympathetic, though on second thoughts, probably not.
FAVOR	Spent two hours at the supermarket, parking, figuring out what to buy when whole sections were empty, and waiting to pay. Definitely not one person per four sq metres. Not the case at my kid's school either. #COVID19
FAVOR	I just learnt that I have to WAIT until someone in my school to get the coronavirus. if that happens then I will get it, right!
FAVOR	There are very few events in life that can cause a systems collapse.  #Coronavirus pandemic is one of them.  @NYCMayor needs to act with greater sense of emergency and cancel everything.  #shutdownNYC
FAVOR	We not saying schools should close forever nah,they should at least take a break to recover until the 2nd week of August.The aim is for the harsh winter conditions to pass then things can get back to normal.We will try by all means that our children comply:mask:.
FAVOR	2) We as Sadtu want schools to close because of the Standard Operating Procedures are not being implemented consistently across provinces. Schools are operating on autopilot and acting outside the SOP. We won't even get to social inequalities
FAVOR	@kromagin @cbigg81 @DinosaurJaime @OliviaNiland People on the side of keeping kids out of school for another year are harming children far, far more than opening schools would regarding this virus.  I’m beginning to think those teachers don’t really like teaching and shouldn’t be teaching.
FAVOR	@SadtuNational Teaching profession is disrespected in our country. Our Learners will bring death to their parents and they will become orphans due to Covid-19 Teachers will bring death to their families too. It will end in tears.
FAVOR	@Rschooley @Souldiva72 Not testing the theory on any child of mine.
FAVOR	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back
FAVOR	I don’t get why they are waiting for coronavirus to get to schools before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the schools so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it
FAVOR	Many people are asking if Barron is going back to school. Of course not. I care about HIS life. A little. Believe me. #SchoolReopening #schoolchoicenow #coronavirus #COVID #Covid_19 #COVIDー19
FAVOR	@jwgop @realDonaldTrump If it’s so safe to send the kids,teachers, staff back to closed rooms, then why is the WH STILL testing everyone that comes in? Why isn’t the WH open for tours?
FAVOR	I'm acc getting nervous now to go college because of the high risk of coronavirus,  we all need to be safe man and to do so we all need to be self isolating. Fuck the economy for two weeks
FAVOR	@BorisJohnson Can you please explain to the nation what plans you have put in place to open up the schools in September!! Seemingly you (like trump) don't have a plan Get your act together else the schools will be empty Spend the money on school safety! :rage:
FAVOR	I'm YOUTH Brigade we have not been paid at that time we risk our lives to make sure that for those schools open are safe for kids by sanitizing classes and kids before and after school, taking temp, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks #PayBrigades
FAVOR	@donwinslow So glad Dekalb County schools doing virtual cause going back to school during this mess!?!
FAVOR	How about instead of endangering children, you give some money to education and fix our schools' horrible technology infrastructure so they can do the same things from home.
FAVOR	@CP24 Why are we NOT talking this seriously in Canada? Why are we so arrogant to think that we are immune to this!? Why would the convention take place??? This is insane. #COVID19
FAVOR	We don’t want free stuff! We  appreciate the best efforts put in by our schools. Our school deserves to take fees  for adapting to the new ways of teaching!
FAVOR	I honestly think students should start staying off school at the moment. Covid-19 is now confirmed in my town and it’s sure to spread like rapid fire. I don’t understand why the schools aren’t shutting down or at least doing deep cleans
FAVOR	@drdavidsamadi @Acosta There's a vas deferens between Urology and Infectious Disease specialities. The science is clear that it's not safe to reopen schools. This is genocide and YOU should be ashamed for promoting the WH talking points and not facts.
FAVOR	No one has ever come up with a real plan for what happens when a student, teacher or staff member tests positive or dies from COVID-19. Do you close the school? Do you send the kids in knowing one of them may have contracted it?
FAVOR	@News24 That's not a good idea for schools to open its cold now n Corona works when it's cold so please man not now ...
FAVOR	@donwinslow Trump is like the mayor of Amity Island in the movie Jaws. Demanding schools open is like demanding the beaches open
FAVOR	Schools won't shut down because the government is if certain the problem is with alcohol and cigarettes
FAVOR	@PressSec Show us the science that children and staff are not in harm's way if schools open.&lt; All of it, as I know you hate cherry picked data.&gt;   Cases are skyrocketing. Schools are *not* daycares.
FAVOR	my school will only close for 48hrs if there’s a coronavirus case and then we’ll all probably have to return to normal as if nothing’s happened. wtf?
FAVOR	@ParTroyHills @TroyHillsSchool if u have an employee who has come in contact with coronavirus why would u let students come in contact w/them or anything they touch &amp; risk spreading it #coronavirus #bettersafethansorry
FAVOR	Unless the so called madam minister Angie gets infected by the virus that the only way she'll finally gain her conscious and decides to close schools if not then she'll want to sacrifice our children for their own amusement we should protest if we have too!!!
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn Pipe down until you get us testing, PPE, and safety measures in the classroom. You want us to go, John? Your kids go first.
FAVOR	@hartfordcourant Reopening schools in a few weeks... will teachers be eligible for workers’ comp when COVID infects us? I’m heading back in a few weeks with protections like “recommended distancing when possible”. Who will sub for sick teachers? This is crazy. #NotMyKid
FAVOR	So private schools are taking decisions to close. Not public schools? Viruses don’t discriminate. Viruses don’t care about your bank balance. Viruses don’t care if you went to Hillsong conference, or the football or to school. #COVID2019 #COVID19Aus #coronavirus
FAVOR	@PressSec If you “follow the science” it does not take you to “open our schools.” If that morally doomed infant you spawned was old enough to attend school you know damn well you’d keep it home. See
FAVOR	@donwinslow @PressSec says that the administration won’t let science stand in the way of opening the schools.   This can not stand.
FAVOR	@DarrenSproat @PremierScottMoe In 5 weeks, the Premier plans to move kids to the front lines, unprepared.
FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump You guys don’t give a shit. If you did, there’s no strategy, funds or a plan to safely send children to school.  #COVID19
FAVOR	C’mon Governors!  Don’t let DJT dictate and threaten you! Get your heads together and refuse to open schools at this time.  What? Is he going to cut off school funding to half the country? That is not how one wins an election!
FAVOR	@JustinBrannan @agounardes @Sen_Gounardes  I'm concerned about the coronavirus and CUNYs lack of disinfecting strategies. They aren't cleaning. CUNY is overcrowded and we're all commuter schools, we can't avoid mass transit. They won't listen to us. #CUNY
FAVOR	Los Angeles County is still in Scenario II; therefore, BUSD is faced with a Hobson’s Choice. Our students, teachers, and staff have to wait for at least one person to become infected with Coronavirus before we can close schools.
FAVOR	@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Then why are schools being forced to open if he is so caring?
FAVOR	Definitely keeping my kids home until there is a tested, wide spread vaccine.
FAVOR	No vaccine, no school!  Kids are required to show vaccine records to set foot on any public school campus. Now we are letting that slide so they can pass around COVID and risk dying?
FAVOR	@MaryEllenKlas @GovRonDeSantis FL #Covid19 cases are going :arrow_up: not :arrow_down:. @GovRonDeSantis re-evaluate that. The workers within the school system are mainly in the "high risk" Bus Drivers, Teachers, Aides, Administration, Custodial, and support staff.  #SocialDistance in already overcrowded classes??
FAVOR	"Schools will now be the experiment," Carroll says. "We're going to see a bunch of schools open with varying levels of control, and then we will see what happens." See what happens? Our children dying is not an experiment.!
FAVOR	@TessEractica @NotSteveOkay @VABVOX @KoriWasinger @ABC I saw that. This is yet another reason why we can't open schools. These anti-mask folks ruin gains made, even work in schools and have kids. No way would I want my kid sitting next to some whacked out anti-mask kid or get an anti-mask teacher.
FAVOR	Riddle me this...the government has been so hell bent on vaccinations not allowing kids to attend school until they’re updated..we don’t even have a fucking vaccine for COVID so why does this moron and his negligent administration want to reopen schools??
FAVOR	To slow the spread of the #CoronaVirus #COVID19  #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools #CloseTheSchools
FAVOR	@MotherJones Schools are petri dishes for any infection like flu .Any study that has been done abt kids is flawed because we protect our children,since March they have not been interacting with other kids. Reopening will cause outbreaks.Teachers,Staff,families  will be affected
FAVOR	If u ain’t sick we all finna have a ton of time to stay home and workout because of quarantine. Become a skinny legend :clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone: #coronapocolypse #COVID2019 #coronavirus
FAVOR	THE ONLY ONES RUSHING TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS DON’’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE KIDS OR EDUCATION. IT’S POLITICS
FAVOR	Like realistically what’s the point in having school tomorrow amid this coronavirus outbreak...
FAVOR	@eNCA @SABCNews only PUBLIC schools will be closed??? What happens then to the PRIVATE school kids, are they not prone to contracting COVID-19, or are they moving their learning online? What then of the POOR kids???
FAVOR	I really don’t like homeschooling the grandkids but I’ll do it in a heartbeat before I let trump sacrifice my grand babies for his re-election.
FAVOR	This is a wakeup call! Coronavirus can destroy the private education industry that took decades to stand on its feet. If we let it collapse now, it will take decades to build up again.
FAVOR	The Republicans didn’t care about gun violence in our schools, why would they care about a virus!
FAVOR	So, Republicans want to move their stupid convention outdoors, but kids should go sit in schools?
FAVOR	@BorisEP @JoeBiden This footage was filmed during the last week. This is @realDonaldTrump America and it is terrifying. I’m not facing the #TrumpsGestapo but I am facing @CherokeeSchools opening with no face mask requirement or social distancing plan. #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	Kids go to school so they can learn, not so you can work. Not so they can die. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn And what exactly are you doing to make schools any safer, Senator?  Teachers and students need PPEs and testing.  Most school don’t have nurses or even money for sanitizers and tissues. You want all kids going back to school without safeguards?
FAVOR	People saying that schools and the economy could already be opened, with significantly less danger and financial distress, if we just handled the virus as well as most other countries are missing the point! COVFEFE! @realDonaldTrump
FAVOR	I think this is just absurd. Really, why are they waiting for kids everywhere to start catching the Coronavirus before starting to close schools? Why not just close the schools NOW to prevent it even getting to that stage?:thinking_face:
FAVOR	@MarilynTatman You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution.
FAVOR	Option of homeschooling is for the rich. Not for the poor. You gave Us no choice. Then you say if they don’t go to school there wont be be space for them next year :woman_shrugging_medium-light_skin_tone:. What choice or options are there? #COVID19 #angie #LockdownSA
FAVOR	Kids need to brave the pandemic and return to school ASAP so future Republicans can also have educated people to ignore. #RepublicansAreKillingUs #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica #RepublicansAreTheProblem #COVID19
FAVOR	@DrZweliMkhize This thing is bad, I knew of someone I was traveling with , that passed away, the guy was never off-sick, healthy and all. Covid is shit...man. And schools are still open @angie_motshekga
FAVOR	@mitch61nm @yeahunoeme So...Religious and private schools can do anything they want.  PUBLIC schools must fully open, on campus and no PPE restrictions.   What a vile evil man he is. Genocide against the non elite. With our children as the catalyst.
FAVOR	Why is it so important for the Department of Education to open schools na bethuna because thina as parents of these kids the ones who will benefit most from thier education we say they must stay home.
FAVOR	My daughter is a SLP working in public schools. I do not want her to be exposed to COVID everyday and risk our lives for an agenda from the trump regime.
FAVOR	@GovRonDeSantis There's a bunch of Charlie Manson's running around. Don't leave your life in these killers hands. And do not sacrifice your children for these murderers!  #WearAMask
FAVOR	If I wear a mask while teaching VCE students, I don't know how I'm supposed to speak clearly. Moreover, I expect that many parents will keep their kids home. Remote teaching is optimal right now, more than it ever has been.
FAVOR	@MarkDice @Acosta The science is not "on our side." They keep saying countries which have reopened schools, but those countries have managed the virus, where have not! We are currently averaging 62K new cases a day. She even says we are the outlier. Yeah because Trump F*cked this up!
FAVOR	When admin and school boards vote to reopen public schools they should have to vote in desks that are only 2ft apart in rooms with no open windows, without providing masks or hand washing soap. :soap:   #BetsyDeVos #idahoCovid19
FAVOR	@CDCgov We should all be terrified that @realDonaldTrump is blocking @CDCgov from testifying on reopening schools. He’s sacrificing the lives of kids, teachers &amp; school staff &amp; he doesn’t want us to know. This. Is. Happening.
FAVOR	Trump is NOT an educator and he's NOT a doctor why would anyone listen to Trump over our educators who have been in the classroom?? We know the nature of students and we know students Will Not social distance or keep their mask on.... They're Children
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan California, Bay Area (San Mateo). Rising Covid numbers. Daughter is Soph. HS, wife is a 1st grade teacher. So stressful April. IMHO, County re-opened to fast. People still don't want to wear mask. No vaccine in SIGHT! GOP is a bunch of a$$holes
FAVOR	@dougducey It is unsafe to open schools in 4 weeks.   We can almost guarantee you will not follow the science but follow Trump down the rabbit hole again.  This time you can take that trip alone.
FAVOR	@B52Malmet Well, that says it all! #StayAtHome
FAVOR	All the schools out there really waiting for someone to get the virus just to confirm this "corona virus" is real. There are LITERALLY children under the age of 5 that go to school
FAVOR	Remember when people said, "Imagine if Covid-19 killed children instead of the elderly...how would we react then?"  Do we want to find out?
FAVOR	@Mike_Pence @VP @UofSC Yet, 85 infants have been diagnosed with covid!! You think school kids are gonna keep their masks on all day? Wash their hands every single time they need to? Not scream, yell, sing, spit on another kid or school staff?! Wake the hell up!!! #pencemakesnosense
FAVOR	So. What are we MISSING while Donald &amp; betsy promote reopening schools?  Tax returns? Rigged 2016? Rigged 2020? The siphoning off of USA $$$ to Russia &amp; China?   MARY TRUMPS BOOK?   Donalds escape hatch getting readied?
FAVOR	If a teacher catches 'Rona while at work in their school, but passes while admitted in the hospital, is that considered a work-related death and will their spouses receive a death benefit accordingly?  #COVID19
FAVOR	@nycjim @PressSec Science is based on FACTS  Not Figures Not Corporations  Not Political Agendas  And not for negligent, corrupt criminals who want to jumpstart economy to work their campaigns.  Schools should be closed until there is a vaccine.  This is Our Children  Not Products.
FAVOR	the hospital which is a walk down form the school had a patient die of the corona virus but my school isnt closed hm
FAVOR	@marcorubio There is no absolute here.  Kids need schooling which is education, not "need to go back to school" which is a place.  The cost of life outweighs the cost of being at a place every time. Stop word-smithing your way around an issue that could kill thousands.  
FAVOR	@drcarachrist you commented that kids are not spreaders and less susceptible but many countries have had to close schools because of spread.  You need to research more before speaking.
FAVOR	America is so used to children being gunned down while AT SCHOOL that it seems very easy for them to ready for #COVID19 deaths that are coming for the teachers/students/their families as American schools are being FORCED to reopen for in person education!
FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump How can a child dream when dead? #schools
FAVOR	If offices and meetings can continue online, why can't schools!!  Address the problem which logic and looking at present times.  @PMOIndia @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh
FAVOR	@Themftruth3 My child will not be going back to school next month.   Incidence of COVID is 10x more now than it was when schools here (Connecticut) closed on March.
FAVOR	Now stop calling them schools, colleges, universities because they are test centers now. You have to teach at home &amp; schools just to rate excellent, good, poor. Honestly, I am speaking after experience of children education. Therefore, make everything online.
FAVOR	@csheets44 @GovMikeDeWine My daughter goes to Dayton public schools and last year she had to sit in science class with no teacher the entire year. They gave them a packet and left them alone for the day. How will this year look??? This is going to be a disaster. SMH
FAVOR	What about the kids are being forced to go back to school because their parents are virus/pandemic deniers? Our kiddos are more aware than some give them credit for. That’s not an environment that promotes learning. That’s an environment that can create PTSD.
FAVOR	@MinnesotaDFL Huh. Not to many, compared to all the worried parents, schools,teachers,and staff. @mngop , you don't even meet in person and hold legislative hearings on line.
FAVOR	@murpharoo @David_Speers How the hell are kids meant to practice social distancing in classes of 40 kids? No hand sanitizer or even hand soap in toilets. #Morrison is making a mockery of #SocialDistancing #morrisonmixedmessages
FAVOR	S3nd the kids who dont wear masks 1st to school and then we'll see in 2 weeks whether they die or not
FAVOR	5. We are social beings by our very nature of being human -   trying to involuntary dehumanize ourselves is not sustainable - maybe for the younger generation by that I mean 5 year olds &amp; below!  We cannot teach old dogs new tricks - bring out the vaccines!
FAVOR	In this critical time of Covid-19 pandemic outbreak where every parent was worried about their child's future, the initiative of adopting online education is appreciable &amp; a blessing in disguise.
FAVOR	@WJReid3 It’s crazy that @NYGovCuomo &amp; @NYCMayor aren’t taking action. They must want the #coronavirus to spread. That’s the only reason to not
FAVOR	All I’mma say to the North Carolina school district....if the #coronavirus  hits NC, students should have to right to stay out of school and #HBCUs shouldn’t expect for us to come to school if the outbreak hits colleges and universities
FAVOR	@CovfefeKatie Katie, This is great if you are gathering info and making a list. If schools don't open parents should pull there kids out of public school and seek a better alternative. #kidsfirst
FAVOR	Teachers are already underappreciated and paid nothing as it is. Now teachers are expected to fight a deadly disease like #Covid19 ? Teacher lives matter, student lives matter, black student lives matter. All lives matter. Teachers and students are not an experiment
FAVOR	This Coronavirus lark is getting out of hand! I think it's time to close the schools :wink:
FAVOR	@INCPunjab @capt_amarinder Its a request to please close the Schools n colleges for at least a fortnight owing to the threat of coronavirus. Else We would be putting children’s lives under threat. #COVID19india
FAVOR	#schoolsmustshutdown You just closed/banned alcohol,the reason was/is you are protecting us from Covid 19 because it's extremely increasing everyday yet since schools re-opened teacher's and learner's have added to the  increasingly number #pleaseprotectus
FAVOR	CSUN, do the right thing and protect your students! What are you waiting for?????? Other Universities are allowing their students to have the option to take classes on line... WHY CAN’T YOU??? @csunorthridge #CSUN;#COVID19;
FAVOR	I support online #school for my children as that is the new normal in the current turbulent times. Don’t try to ruin schools and education
FAVOR	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT
FAVOR	OMG! I heard that only FOUR schools closed in my state because of coronavirus! :O  I hope it's not gonna spread.... I'm so terrified, and also tomorrow I have college &gt;~&lt;
FAVOR	My children rarely go out - if they catch Coronavirus it will be from school and I will not be happy if I’m honest - my middle boy has asthma so I am worried for him :tired_face:
FAVOR	Every school district should be asking their governors and the mayors and their school boards to give them the facts not opinions on opening the schools did the children. The facts do not back up the hysteria. Children will suffer..
FAVOR	Friendly reminder that reopening schools is essentially biological warfare against BIPOC children.
FAVOR	#cyrilramaphosa close schools or open Parliament. .
FAVOR	1/ I’ve got a solution. Why don’t then school districts just give us our summer vacation early. We could end school mid March and resume school in mid June if #coronavirus is contained. The 2019-2020 school year could be finished during what would have been...
FAVOR	Hey @realDonaldTrump and @GOP, to have safe schools, you must mandate masks and close non-essential businesses. No one NEEDS a tattoo right now.
FAVOR	@donwinslow I'm 67 and I babysit my grandson, who is autistic.  He will never be able to keep a mask on for 7 hours a day.  I know his parents agree.
FAVOR	Today our school released their “return to learn” plan. The plan is fine, however recent FB postings of school sanctioned activities with no masks &amp; no social distancing makes me pause. I will make whatever sacrifices are necessary for my children to learn from home
FAVOR	@GaydosKTAR Trump has cancelled the RNC Convention in Jacksonville, FL due to concerns about #covid19.   Gov. Doucey extended the closure of Bars, Theaters, Gyms n Pools  But they wants us to send our children to school. That makes alot of sense :man_facepalming::man_facepalming::man_facepalming:
FAVOR	@GEEPENNIN They brag about being the “pro-life” party yet are doing nothing to protect our children in their own schools, whether it be from this pandemic or from school shootings - their hypocrisy knows no bounds....
FAVOR	okay but it’s abit worrying when hertfordshire has the most coronavirus cases than anywhere in the UK and that’s where you go to college PLEASE
FAVOR	Parents that want the schools to reopen no matter what are monsters that don’t give a flying fuck about their kids’ well-being, sacrificing their own litter only to make a moronical political statement. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	@Acosta So I guess trumpedo administration is abolishing science in schools. Cuz what it’s the point to teach children science if adults (not all of them but the stupid ones) don’t believe in it. Anyway my daughter is NOT going to face to face school this fall.
FAVOR	If schools don't open funding should go to the parents!?!?  1) They are open, it's virtual 2) Where is the excess capacity for these kids if they leave their current school?  This is as smart as arm the teachers. @EricTrump level smart.  #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	I am sick to my stomach over the thought that there are districts informing #teachers to update their wills and having both children and teachers sign waivers over dying. We are not at a point of safety to open schools properly.
FAVOR	@Joe22143142 @DPACSheffield @amandadewinter @PTE_Campaign @Rachel_deSouza @lehain ...and of course of the 60 schools that have had cases so far, we have no idea how many of these will progress to hospital or death. Our children are being used as guinea pigs.
FAVOR	We would all feel very different about schools reopening if we had a goverment that: -Was trustworthy -Had best interest of children as only motivation  -Based on Science  -provided necessary resources to ALL schools -had a National plan   None of these is true
FAVOR	@NBCLA Im scared to go to school #LAUSD needs to stop being money greedy they aren’t thinking of those kids who have low immune system and who can easily catch the #coronavirus and spread it
FAVOR	If online study is there then parents should pay the fees to the schools ..schools are doing their best in this situation also...
FAVOR	If I'm wrong about schools reopening, all that happens is my son does distance learning for another semester or two. If DeVos is wrong, people die. I'll say it again.
FAVOR	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren.
FAVOR	@Rosie I am a registered nurse. With over 15 years experience in pediatric and vaccines. Do not under any circumstances send your children to school. Do not do it. It will be a catastrophe, disease will spread, bringing COVID-19 virus into your homes and family. #
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump The RNC is moving Trump Convention to outdoor space because of COVID but R’s want kids in schools!  #Covidiots #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
FAVOR	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids!
FAVOR	we gotta go back to school, i bet once they start pushing kids back to school, there will be a massive increase in cases. Kinda sad how they still don’t realize we are in the middle of a pandemic where cases are still rising erryday. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	My game on Sunday has been cancelled consisting of 22 players, yet my college of 4,000 people is still open. Makes sense. #Covid_19 #CoronaVirus
FAVOR	@NorahODonnell @CDCgov @BojorquezCBS This is extremely Frightening news especially with a high number of schools mandating “in-person” school AND the government basically discrediting CDC!!! :flushed: Not to mention all of the current civil unrest!!! :flushed::flushed: #PublicHlthDisaster
FAVOR	Dear #lausd If I keep my kid home from middle school to keep her safe from #coronavirus #COVID19 it SHOULD NOT count against her as an absence. Please alert families that this’ll be allowed. NOW IS THE TIME TO SAVE LIVES, not when the virus shows up in school
FAVOR	All I can say is...you better have an ARMY of substitute teachers standing by!! And cafeteria staff...and bus drivers...and janitorial staff. Because having teachers out for weeks at a time is HUGE!!  #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	Any education lawyers out there?   If a teacher or a child dies of #COVID19 CAUGHT AT SCHOOL can the government be sued, given every other damn country has cancelled schools?  Surely there’s a duty of care there?
FAVOR	@FordThefordster @DannyAShea @vankapro @Jay_V_F_45 My granddaughter lives with me yr 11 HAS to go to school! @DanielAndrewsMP don't you know so many grandparents are bringing up their homeless grandchildren, some with no government assistance! She's been doing very well with homeschooling.
FAVOR	News station: "What will parents do if schools don't re-open this fall?"  Me: "Survive."  #COVID19 #pandemic #schoolsreopening
FAVOR	Spare tie? Never heard of her, I've dedicated this whole week to refreshing the news page waiting for the schools to close down or for Boris Johnson to get the Corona Virus
FAVOR	@joshi_speaks @zoneanthony @anubha1812 For underprivileged government is offering free education, take for one year and when the situation changes shift back to private schools. Also can talk to school and ask for more instalments for payment of fees. Every school is ready to offer monthly instalment
FAVOR	Shut down schools and continuepaying teachers . You pay people for making children so why not somebody who did not choose to put their life on hold ?
FAVOR	Public schools will start out with remote learning at the beginning of the school year here in North Texas.  Private schools have not made the same announcement.  So my kid will not be saturated in neither COVID nor smug privilege while learning this year.
FAVOR	Trump doesn’t care about the 135,000 Americans that have died on his watch. His cronies have been released from prison due to the coronavirus. Do you really think he cares about our children?
FAVOR	@HoarseWisperer Laura Ingraham has 3 school-age children: Maria, 15, Michael, 12, &amp; Nikolai, 10. Ingraham has not told anyone if her kids will be staying home. (Ingraham works at home due to coronavirus.)  Don’t you want to know her plans for her own children? #GOPkids #NotMyKid
FAVOR	@WHRapidResponse @WHRapidResponse @PressSec  Let's talk about: "Completely...misleading." 48 CHILDREN IN STUDY! Study: 3/14-4/10/20 (1 MO). 2019-2020 Influenza Season (6 MO). Their finding w/limitations: limit testing &amp; end of follow-up 15 children still in hospitals. #ScienceMatters
FAVOR	Dear Trump, DeVos and all #MAGA pushing to reopen schools before it is safe,  If are Federal government had taken this pandemic seriously and acted accordingly it would be safe to reopen schools this fall. But they didn't, so it's not.
FAVOR	-thats the end of it. I'm not risking my grandparents lives over your own greedy needs. you're supposed to keep us SAFE, not put us out in HARM. we are not your puppets for you to throw around and pick up whenever you need something. KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED.
FAVOR	Lowkey the only way I’m progressing in education is if they close schools so...who tryna catch it:grin: #coronavirus
FAVOR	@PTI_News The Schools n colleges should be closed pan India,  for at least a fortnight owing to the threat of coronavirus. Else We would be putting a lot lives under threat. Do not want an Italy like response #COVID19india
FAVOR	But now it’s ok to send them to school meanwhile #coronavirus it’s still infecting anyone  There’s no cure No vaccine No treatment   &amp; something like #WearAMaskSaveALife is a fighting issue  Parents Listen to Science Facts Medical Experts  Your children depend on you
FAVOR	Literally everyday now I commute to school while reading in the news how the number of infected ppl from the corona virus is increasing and @CUNY just keeps sending emails instead of coming with an actual prevention plan that let us stay home...
FAVOR	I support pvt schools for continuing with Online Classes during this Pandemic Covid-19. The online classes allows the children to complete their Academic Syllabus of respective standards. Humble Appeal to Hon Government of Gujarat to re-consider its decision.
FAVOR	#SchoolReopening why is it so hard for us blacks to work together &amp; be united mare? If we all agreed not to send kids to school, government will be forced to listen &amp; close schools. I say us blacks cause whites can afford good health care #SchoolStayaway
FAVOR	We send our children to schools so they get quality education and become something great in future - except being a teacher. And yet one who makes them all is ignored. Irony or hypocrisy?
FAVOR	I saw my son's high school principal walk down the supermarket aisle in the wrong direction. His daughter corrected him &amp; he was annoyed. This is the man I am trusting to follow CDC guidelines to head back to school? #FloridaCovidEpicenter #Floridacoronavirus
FAVOR	*whispers* The @GOP isn't trying to win @realDonaldTrump votes by sending your kids back to school with no #COVID19 plan, they're trying to destroy public education by bankrupting and breaking the system by sending it into total chaos when half or more don't show up
FAVOR	Obviously opening schools as usual all across the country is insane and dangerous. However, if you are screaming about closing schools without demanding a solution for parents suddenly without childcare then you do not actually care about parents or children
FAVOR	WHY ARENT U CLOSING SCHOOL FOR CORONA VIRUS. No primary children with weak immune sustem needs this wtf
FAVOR	@DrEricDing So basically, temperature screenings are not enough. Asymptomatic spread.  :mask:  #coronavirus #COVID19  #schoolsreopening
FAVOR	Tell me why the GOP convention in Florida can be cancelled due to Covid but schools are ok to open??? :thinking_face:#COVID #mondaythoughts #teacher
FAVOR	@rena_korb @DemWrite @GovRonDeSantis @americanoreport And to the Florida of California -  @OCDeptofEd wants to send children back to school with no masks and no social distancing so my question is this:  Why would you risk the health and well-being of our children?
FAVOR	Maybe the govt wants to force kids back to school because they saw kids at home for half a semester learning a non-white-washed-history-curriculum starting to question EVERYTHING and thought.... ah fuck, we gotta get this shit back on track. 
FAVOR	@billlight74 @DesignationSix This is heartbreaking. Someone not named Trump or DeVos needs to come up with a safe plan or just have all schools online or home school. This is our Future. #NotMyGrandchild
FAVOR	Don't let #COVID19 shut down your school, move your classes online &amp; reach every student. We can organize the right tools for remote education on any level to keep your students and staff safe. Contact us Today. #coronavirus #CDC #Quarantine #schoolclosures
FAVOR	Kayleigh McEnany said "the science shouldn't stand in the way" of schools opening.  During a pandemic the only thing we should listen to is SCIENCE! My children are not political pawns #NotMyChildren
FAVOR	Our future is in the hands of our children, is not like am saying this because I left school with grade 7 but schools must be closed.
FAVOR	@CrazyPKAY Its An Unfair Burden To Place On Teachers If The Parents Let Their Kids Do As They Please.   Also, With Cases Being Reported At Schools Everyday It Is Only Right For
FAVOR	Even if a vaccine was released tomorrow, I still would not send my child to school!
FAVOR	@JessedHagopian @shaunking @brothajitu @democracynow The decisions to open schools are being made by over paid people  who don't enter schools, while on remote Zoom meetings!
FAVOR	@CDCgov @CDCemergency 2. We aren't thinking of safety.  This is a direct email from my kid's middle school,  my kid has asthma, is not allowed to take precautions, and will receive no aid if (when ) your child comes into contact with a #COVID19
FAVOR	and all you had to do to make parents feel safer and trust what you're doing is set up a free satellite 5G network, give every student a desktop and VR (for recess in the public school version of Xbox live), create a classroom environment with computer programs
FAVOR	We still need to engage on the matter of schools We support teachers on this one   #mbali  #TsongaDrive  ##SchoolMustClose
FAVOR	The same people that are running around saying they won’t where a mask because it’s government control are now demanding that you send your children to school #Hypocrisy
AGAINST	Many parents who work full time from home or office do not have the luxury of homeschooling or even engaging the child meaningfully. They can’t ignore the needs of parents and deny them their choice #RightToLearn
AGAINST	School makes a child educators , doctor ,engineer and many more . And know schools are suffering by this person who themelves are grownup and build by their schools. Self-respect  is more pandemic then Corona for schools and teachers .Please save your school .
AGAINST	@Lrihendry Schools are shut down but teachers still getting paid. No wonder teachers don’t want schools to reopen.
AGAINST	The children have and are still  undergoing such a big change. The only constant is     their home, parents, teachers &amp; schools. With Schools stopping can you imagine the turmoil all of them will undergo. Just think, think and think
AGAINST	Texas schools are reopening, so why the hell aren't we? @PBSCD  #ReopenSchools
AGAINST	@Real_Eudaimonia Nice. For your sake, I hope the 4 deeply conservatives see through the covid BS and open schools on time, and with none of the unnecessary social distancing precautions.
AGAINST	How can a ban work for all schools without having consulted or included all schools of Gujarat in the decision making process? Don't ruin the entire private education system! #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp
AGAINST	How can we become a global leader if our future citizens are forced to stop learning abruptly? Let Schools function. #RightToLearn #RightToTeach @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp
AGAINST	The way everyone is waiting for University, college and schools to be closed because of coronavirus :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::skull::skull:
AGAINST	So if tonight's family meeting, says "School are closed".  What happens to those who paid yearly school fees?  I am no longer homeschooling, my kids will repeat next year. I don't have energy to teach this second term. #coronavirusInSA
AGAINST	All parents are not trained to be teachers. We need the daily structure that our school and teachers provide in order to help our children. We can assist but can’t replace. Let schools function #SaveOurSchools #RightToTeach @imBhupendrasinh @hrdministry
AGAINST	There is a difference between policy governance and bureaucratic dictatorship! Your order is equivalent to banning education for kids. How can schools teach without getting paid? #SaveOurSchools @PMOIndia @narendramodi @vijayrupanibjp  @imBhupendrasinh
AGAINST	We will surely save our schools.
AGAINST	Will someone please explain to me why everything can open back up, but schools full of children who are the least affected by this virus that 99% recover from remain closed??
AGAINST	If schools don't open this fall, can we just drop the kids off at Walmart for 7 hours?
AGAINST	Schools need to reopen in some form here in the fall. If for no other reason than for many of our students we are the most responsible and dependable adults they will see all day.
AGAINST	Closing the schools will not stop the spread of coronavirus. Everyone will get it at some point, but only few will die from it.
AGAINST	@VivDaRocha @teachcardona @EducateCT @GovNedLamont Apparently you are the one who doesn’t care, perfectly ok with a large percentage of children getting no education if schools don’t open, can you say privilege?
AGAINST	I just left a voice mail message for @GovPritzker of course they dont answer, I asked when Illinois homeowners will be refunded their property taxes considering schools won't be open this fall. #standupillinois #openillinois
AGAINST	Nywe nywe Kenya closed schools for the entire year. The last time I checked this is SA. Our lives can’t be dictated by what our neighbors do. Why don’t you move to Kenya niyeke ukusingxolela
AGAINST	Teachers have been preparing and up skilling themsleves to connect with their learners . Preparedness to face the situation is the key to education and that’s what schools do #SaveOurSchools @CMOGuj
AGAINST	@BillOReilly It’s seriously insulting how #Democrats think we’re all stupid and/or naïve :rage: i’ll tell you where I am, cut off all #federal funding for any who dont comply w opening schools There’s no reason for it!Wear :mask: and keep 5ft distance, hand sanitizers stations
AGAINST	Dear @GavinNewsom , what exactly is the #science behind your decision to unilaterally shut down schools? That's what's supposed to drive your response, right? #antiscience
AGAINST	Think of all the ugly kids that get to wear a mask to school and have a little more confidence...
AGAINST	@Acosta @MikeGiardi Germany. Iceland Netherlands all did actual studies in schools.  All 3 concluded kids in school pose no risk to themselves, nor to others
AGAINST	There will be a tax revolt if they indefinitely close the schools.
AGAINST	@GavinNewsom If masks work open the schools!!
AGAINST	If schools are not reopening this year, can I stop paying my school taxes?
AGAINST	@GovNedLamont Schools must open not all children can distance learn, thank you for thinking of ALL CHILDREN not just the privileged who can stay home and be teachers to their kids.
AGAINST	Why should schools stay closed? None of these kids are social distancing or wearing mask there all on beaches, lake's and hanging out in parking lots in crowd's. They all believe this virus is only older people so let them go to school
AGAINST	Please note: 1. COVID-19 is roughly a 3% Lethality Rate for youth. 2. More likely to effect 0-6 &amp; 50- * 3. It’s very fast spreading 4. You will be FINE. Don’t stress fam #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate
AGAINST	So if the schools do Online learning for next year, what do the homes without Internet access and working parents supposed to do??? #notmykid
AGAINST	They didn't close the schools when the Swine Flu was going around, so they shouldn't close the schools for Coronavirus! If I didn't get time off school because some people had a cough, then neither should they!
AGAINST	Think back to your childhood and think about the role teachers have had in who you are now as an adult. By shutting down schools, you’re effectively taking away the livelihood of those very same teachers.
AGAINST	@votejessi2020 @RhondaTideGirl They need to open up the schools and universities and stop messing with our kids mental health.
AGAINST	#SaveOurSchools Don't discourage the schools and teachers by stopping their salaries @imBhupendrasinh #RightToTeach @vijayrupanibjp @HRDMinistry
AGAINST	The order is arbitrary. They have banned schools from functioning and we have edtech companies like byjus and vedantu promoting it at the same time. Why these double standards?  #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	Unions vow to shut schools down as Covid-19 continues to claim teacher's lives.   Should these unions be successful and schools are closed, do you think that teachers should still receive their full salaries and why?
AGAINST	Since when does the government think homeschooling is the "thing to do"? I remember when they tried outlawing it!
AGAINST	@BillSchammert The problem buried on this fear mongering whine is that it is based on the assumption that schools are for teachers and staff.  They are not.  Schools are for the students who still need to be educated and need the social interaction and opportunities they provide.
AGAINST	@TexasTribune Even if it's ridiculous &amp; unnecessary? Even if it causes our students to fall behind, be at greater risk for child abuse, &amp; causes parents to lose their livelyhoods because they are unable to work? Closing schools is disgraceful &amp; history will not treat you kindly.
AGAINST	To all educators, I say this as a teacher with decades of experience, get your asses back in the classroom or quit and let a real teacher take your place.   Cowards. #schools
AGAINST	First they included BPL students in private schools through RTE. Than they controlled fees through FRC. And now they don't want schools to collect fees and yet give education. What habit and trend are we creating for our future?
AGAINST	They’ve had 5 months to get the schools opened fully and safely. 5 months!!! No excuses. 5 months!! What a bunch of bull.
AGAINST	@AnnaForFlorida My son's school has guidelines in place.  These guidelines and steps are very thought out...all looks good to me.  He is going back to school when it opens next month.
AGAINST	#SaveOurSchools Learning is a fundamental right that no child should be deprived of. #RightToLearn #RightToTeach How will that happen if you stop schools? @vijayrupanibjp @HRDMinistry
AGAINST	@RahulGandhi The priority of any government should be to provide education to students and not shutting it down. By shutting down schools &amp; online classes,the @CMOGuj government will make Teachers &amp; schools fall into debt trap.The adverse impact of such a move is multifaceted.
AGAINST	The beauty of homeschooling   Children are not safe at home
AGAINST	Why is opening schools a political issue now? Families of kids with special needs are really struggling without school or in person services. Zoom makes my son’s sensory issues worse. Do ye want to come over and hold him while he screams? That’s the reality of it.
AGAINST	Schools need to go back! Keeping them closed causes parents to stay away from work to homeschool their kids. It holds back the entire economy, and by the way, kids don't die from this disease!
AGAINST	@Davos tells us that this is the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Digital citizenry is key, digital illiteracy will take us out of the race. @PMOIndia &amp; @imBhupendrasinh Please don’t stop schools &amp; online learning but EXTEND it to everyone. #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	We do all kinds of #coronavirus work arounds, but not just shut everything down, deliver groceries/meds, contact trace, til the virus has no host. its just too hard, :flag_for_United_States:? state by state we would reopen. then there is no school question. Over. Done. But no.

AGAINST	@SenKamalaHarris School closings affect poor &amp; POC who can’t afford private schools, tutors &amp; daycare. If you care about education you should demand that schools open or give vouchers for daycare, tutors or private schools. Not all kids learn online not all parents can help.
AGAINST	Our children are suffering and dying, but it’s not from Covid-19.  It is from the lockdowns, malnutrition, anxiety disorders, child abuse and social isolation.    There is absolutely no scientific reason for schools not to reopen immediately.
AGAINST	#ReopeningSchools with social distancing  and face mask is new world order environment of torture, loss of identity, loss of human touch, with fear of others. Fate sealed for student experimentation of any form, destroying what it is to be human.
AGAINST	If K-12 schools don’t open, why do I have to pay for 70% of my property taxes when I will essentially be teaching my own children. Sorry, but watching YouTube videos &amp; answering questions are not teaching/learning.
AGAINST	@conunlibro @MiamiSup @ariodzernbc6 Don't agree, open schools and gjve parents choice of remote learning. Which by the way it's not working.
AGAINST	The World needs almost 69 million new teachers to reach the 2030 Education goals. How will we hire and retain good talent in our schools if we cannot pay them well?  @CMOGuj @imBhupendrasinh  #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	@CAgovernor @GavinNewsom Stop screwing up our kids over a virus w- 99.9% survival rate!  You are out of your mind! Let's get back to normal asap. Open all schools same as last year.   Covid is a proven NOTHINGBURGER. End of story.  Stop your psychological assault on our children.

AGAINST	If daycares can open to serve essential workers and teachers, why can't schools open?
AGAINST	@murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump There is no substitute for human interaction, @murray_nyc    Virtual learning certainly has some benefits, but students are not getting certain things from virtual learning. Combine that with social isolation and the impact that has on kids.
AGAINST	@Traderlebowski @katrinagulliver @BenAltitude @JoeSilverman7 Dude, how do teachers get paid?  Here is a clue,  property taxes.  Teachers are no better than nurses,  doctors,  police,  cashiers,  bank tellers,  and so on. Teachers needs to get back to work. Wear a damn mask.
AGAINST	@Variety I guess teachers aren’t essential workers after all.  We managed to keep grocery clerks working. It isn’t hard to protect teachers. We’re the only country in the world not opening schools. @TheDemocrats want to keep people stupid &amp;compliant.  This madness has to end
AGAINST	@Theresa_Chapple @jsrsba Honestly I seriously doubt they died FROM covid.   Would be nice to know details. Do you know how many children died from the flu and also on the way to school last year.  Also how many died of child abuse during lockdown ? Life’s complicated
AGAINST	@GerryPoling1 @dbltrouble247 @JoyAnnReid Schools employ janitors, no split schedule; kids back full time and teachers have health insurance through the unions!  Problem solved!
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov They will@make sure that schools do not open and also make sure there is a second wave. Unless you stop this madness, the economy will falter again and you will not win the election. ACT NOW! #sheeple
AGAINST	@aebrennen So true. Your teachers need to focus on what they need to do to get ready for the fall semester. Teachers are planning right now. Let them know what the expectation will be. Online learning is a temporary situation. #SchoolReopening
AGAINST	@HillaryClinton Citizens shouldn’t be subject to infection via contact w/ protesters, unknowingly. For protesting to be more important than church, businesses, and schools remaining open shows our country has a biased view of what is effective against this shit and what isn’t.

AGAINST	@pr0mode I'm thinking that if kids going into college thing that 15% of $8,000 is about $300.00 that we really need school choice and to open up schools now.  #SchoolChoice
AGAINST	My question to South Africa is....till when are you going to sit at home and wait for things to go back to normal,what if things never go back to normal,what if the vaccine takes 10 years to reach you,think about that too.
AGAINST	Please reopen the schools
AGAINST	@JoeSilverman7 When my kid started preK, we were at the docs once per month. Doc always said, hang in there, it’s better for him. Fast forward 6 years:other than well visits and vaccines, he hasn’t been sick. I’m willing to take my chances as a high risk mom...

AGAINST	the fact that my district isn’t closing the schools because no student has the corona virus (that we know of) when the hospitals are saying that there WILL be an outbreak is ridiculous.
AGAINST	@imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj Your order is equivalent. How can schools teach without getting paid?
AGAINST	Alcohol was banned with immediate effect because it provides no tenders for creedy comorates, school will proceed due to the fact that they have tenders in schools, ppes, feeding schemes, transportation, etc

AGAINST	#Covid19 killed 58 children under age 18. most are asymptomatic.  in 2017-18, the seasonal flu killed 188 children in the same age bracket. if they want to rely on data to open schools, I'm all for it. seems like a slam dunk to me.
AGAINST	Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker as well as Massachusetts State Democrats are trying to get Fed funding for daycare. Now if they can open daycares they surely can open schools. I believe coronavirus doesn't discriminate between toddlers n school-age children.

AGAINST	Since teachers are afraid to reopen schools for the fear of catching Covid, then maybe we should just bring the classroom to Walmart since most of them probably have no problem going in there.

AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto Start protesting parents and everyone who wants the Economy to be stable.  The pandemic is not as bad as initially thought.  Every child should be allowed to go to school as normal.  Face masks also make zero sense.  99.95 chance of survival and rising!
AGAINST	@JRubinBlogger He doesn’t want to kill any kids. :woman_facepalming: Using your misguided logic KIDS can NEVER go back to school until they ERADICATE the FLU!! The Flu is more deadly to kids than the Coronavirus!
AGAINST	@Gagan2627 Let's be careful what we wish for. If govt schools were working fine, India would not have needed private schools. School owners pay teachers, rentals &amp; other expenses from the fee that parents pay. With FRC, anyways, there is control on fee. What more is needed?

AGAINST	#Democrat Leaders &amp; #Teachers Unions don't care about your children or your teachers. They're closing schools &amp; mandating elearning when the #Science demands the opposite. Children are least likely to catch #COVID19 &amp; spread it to teachers, parents, &amp; grandparents.
AGAINST	Anyone opposing the shut down of schools is crook.
AGAINST	@dbongino As a teacher, I agree!!! The students are suffering without schools open and data shows there is very very low risk to kids. Teachers can mitigate risk to themselves and others. I need to teach my students where they thrive,  which is AT SCHOOL
AGAINST	I've been in online college classes. All yall are about to get dumb as fuck. #COVID19 #coronavirus

AGAINST	How can you go from saying that the biggest protests in the history of the US didn’t cause a spike in coronavirus cases, to saying there isn’t a safe way to send kids back to school? Just require masks. They were good enough for the mass protests.
AGAINST	@AlexBerenson Teachers unions suck! Open up the schools!  They were open months ago in Europe, China and everywhere else in the world. Kids don’t spread the virus per the European study.  And mask don’t work (even the fraud Fauci said in March)
AGAINST	Ekalavya gave his thumb to learn from his guru. That is the value our culture places on education, in whichever form it comes. Please allow schools to continue and do not take this away from our children. @vijayrupanibjp

AGAINST	@Oswego308 @OswegoIL60543 @  @oswegochamber  If our schools don't open in the fall I will be expecting a Tax refund similar to my reduced insurance rates.
AGAINST	If we keep waiting for schools to reopen, which doesn’t seem possible in the near future, the  psychological connect and deep-rooted bonding that the children have developed with their teachers and their school will soon be lost.
AGAINST	Teachers help parents manage the learning needs of kids. It’s unfair to stop schools! Let parents lean on their child’s school to help the child. Why deny that? @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj  #SaveOurSchools

AGAINST	This group representing 67,000 pediatricians believe it’s okay for your child to return to school.   The death rate is .36% under age 65.  Under age 20, and the death rate is almost non-existent. The flu is deadlier to your child than coronavirus.
AGAINST	Studies have  shown that the chances of children contracting  COVID-19 are next to nil . Stop throwing shade for your corrupt teachers unions .

AGAINST	@NYGovCuomo This is true which is why Politics shouldn't be involved. Too much govt involvemement destroys everything.  Democrats have totally politicized coronavirus even using students as pawns. All data shows children are not spreaders.
AGAINST	@BlueyBlur @GovNedLamont @teachcardona Absolutely, those who are comfortable with proper protocols should be able to bring their kids fir 5 days schools. Those not comfortable can home school. If daycares, walmart, target, stop n shoo, barbers n nail  salons can figure out waysto open so should schools !
AGAINST	My taxes should NOT go to public schools &amp; teachers that don't open  Kids need socialization &amp; keeping them home will harm their psyche. This mandate is pushed by scared adults. Kids' immunities are strongest &amp; their COVID risk is less than any age group
AGAINST	If teachers don't do their work at schools, then they should not get paid!
AGAINST	@LJ4fcps schools should be opened in the fall.
AGAINST	@AngelaTeague12 @KTULNews Considering the younger population is much less impacted by the virus, there really isn’t a reason to keep schools closed. Plus, a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics encourages “having students physically present in school.”
AGAINST	@FoxNewsSunday @BetsyDeVosED How ironic that the same people pretending to care about child education also want schools to stay closed and block any attempt to reform with #SchoolChoiceNow. The silver lining of quarantine may be a renewed interest in #Homeschooling which Biden WILL block!!
AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump That is not what they said. And you know that. They want schools to open safely ONLY if the spread of COVID-19 in an area is under CONTROL. But given the GOP and this administration’s completely botched response in handling this pandemic, that will NOT be possible.
AGAINST	Ok, so we can't trust educators to safe distance or wear masks? Why in the hell are we letting them teach our children?
AGAINST	Schools must open in the fall. Early learning (K-4th) is so vital. Children won’t get what they need in most homes.

AGAINST	It’s been four months, my kids have played with their neighborhood friends almost every day- none of us have COVID. Tell me why we can’t open up schools WITHOUT masks and social distancing?
AGAINST	I know schools that've closed 3 times in the last 30 days. Such stunts are emotionally draining &amp; traumatizing to learners. They hinder effective learning, to make matters worse most matrics are taught using smartboards which are now affected by loadshedding
AGAINST	Reopen the schools because online classes are not benefitting us,they are causing more troubles.
AGAINST	@DanCrenshawTX Schools need to reopen. The science shows children who do contract Covid do not become ill like adults and they do not pass it.
AGAINST	And we do not know when these physical classrooms will happen. Parents cannot manage with apps at home, and the skilled teachers are preparing to normalise as far as possible. Till now it is ok. What if schools dont open till December? Year gone?
AGAINST	You know @realDonaldTrump you did it all wrong. You where suppose to demand that all schools stay closed, that way all schools would be opening!
AGAINST	How about equipping school districts deploy Food Truck Schools to their streets....Lunch and Learns .... Canopied open air with heat columns...ancient Greek lyceums refreshed. Nutrition boosted...real private sector and whole government effort....

NONE	Vaccine or no vaccine were BACK I quote the Dotard in the oval office
NONE	Teachers unions making demands that have nothing to do with our children. Medicare for all, defunding the police, shutting down charter schools... Liberal BS.
NONE	@AgarkarFatima By that logic, everything private, be it the FMGC industry, or automobile industry, or service sectors, all should provide free of cost services till they go bankrupt. Why only schools!? It's really sad, and makes one question the sanity of the ppl in power. :(
NONE	Due to the long shut-down, parents are finding it difficult to pay the school fees. Schools are refraining from pressurising parents on humanitarian grounds.
NONE	nearly 400 people in the uk have coronavirus - guaranteed to jump well over 400 after today - and the government still wants to stay in the contain phase instead of delay phase. mf u failed containing it just move on and

NONE	@anubha1812 Regular audit is done by Income Tax Dept and Edu Dept. It is assuming to hear that everyone outside the official system can do a better job. Please don’t speedy falsehoods. 95% of private schools charge less than RS 1000 per month
NONE	Can I not get coronavirus? Like, I'm healthy enough to fight it, but I might give it to my dad who can't fight it.
NONE	Hike in electric charges. Hike in GST for sanitisers and masks. Hike in petrol and diesel charges. No discussion. Fees not to be collected at all. No discussion too. Is system still seems balanced?
NONE	@JustMEtillDeath @Francis_Joseph Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought
NONE	@GalaJenish @anubha1812 @nidhiindiatv Sorry but schools are usually not profit mongering. Parents who fight education spending but are ready to spend on holiday travel should introspect on what is important.
NONE	If schools will not be  paid by the parents  then how they will pay to their manpower . Either govt will take the responsibility that they will  pay to private teacher until school will not get any fee from parents.

NONE	@donwinslow This is nothing but the truth. Did Twitter censure the bounty Hoax tweet Trump put out, no they didn’t &amp; that tweet is a total lie. NATO and allies were briefed along with Trump himself. So no, @TwitterSupport, this video speaks the truth &amp; nothing is embellished.

NONE	@lsingh_77 Laxman Singh ji TUITION fee payment is not the issue. D issue is the mindset. Not everyone is without money &amp; not everyone has lost the job. The mindset that schools are closed so we wouldn’t pay fee is poisonous. Schools are considering genuine fee issues so plz

NONE	@KarluskaP It's a flu, get over yourself!  Take #Hydroxycloroquine if you're worried.
NONE	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits.

NONE	Educational Department said that many schools have either not paid any salary or paid only 40-50% salary to their staff during the period of the lockdown. But I have received 100% salary, on time. Thanks to @J G International School

NONE	If all are adopting  new techniques  of working  than why private schools  can not?   Please think over the resolution made on ' No school No fees'. We teachers  are working  hard beyond our boundaries, leaving all personal family responsibilities to serve kids.

NONE	@Zee24Kalak @DixitGujarat Do you think its right for the Gujarat Government to stop Private UnAided Schools from charging any fees till they reopen, while teachers are teaching online?  Looking forward to hear your thoughts?
NONE	@JayeetaBasu7 @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj Yes indeed and this will only be possible if capable parents pay the dues on time and be helpful in this direction. They should be allowed to pay and Schools should be allowed to Collect Fees.

NONE	I’m not sure what the right answer is on schools opening.  We need a better debate than privileged people and/or those with no school age children adamantly against it vs. an incompetent president blindly pushing for it.
NONE	Why don’t the small percentage of parents who feel that online education is useless withdraw their children from private schools and admit them in free govt. schools with highly paid and qualified teachers? Why make majority of parents and students suffer?
NONE	So just got a survey call about opening schools in Idaho.  Some interesting questions to say the least.
NONE	I believe Indian schools only create robots, people should rather get into home school, so their perception and vision remains organic.
NONE	@CDCDirector , so you caved. Got it...#CDCTrumpVirus #TrumpVirus

NONE	Has this panemic time not affected schools and teachers? Central govt when says that nobody's salary should be cut or revamp then why this does not apply to teachers and school staff??
NONE	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light
NONE	@columbusmonthly Guess what. Schools closed for 1 MONTH
NONE	@ClayTravis @JohnCooper4Nash It’s not about masks. It’s about the Teachers Union twisting the tax payers arm for more money. Where does it all end?  Money obviously doesn’t fix failing government schools.

NONE	17/18  new #Covid19 cases in Vietnam now are people from Western countries, who flight to or back to our country. 12 foreigners on just 1 flight from London. We're so worried about it, but you guys say it's just like a flu ? Folks, t attacks your fcking lungs
NONE	It’s not ideal, but it solves part of the issue. Teachers would be in their own classrooms, there’s really not an issue of cross contamination like there would be with the hybrid or full return model. Maybe something to think about? #onted #COVID19 
NONE	@carrdretti You think covid-19 isnt that serious? :clown_face:
NONE	The Federal Government has on Monday, 13th July, 2020, released guildlines and requirements for the reopening of schools at all levels though no date of resumption is yet to be announced.  The big question is can students cope?  #CNUI #COVID19
NONE	.@DallasISDMedia NO IN PERSON SCHOOL @ least through Labor Day. New info tomorrow. #COVID19
NONE	If Private schools have earned for many years and so should not take fees for a year than logically speaking Government is collecting Taxes since 1947 so they should also give all services like petrol, electricity, water for free for one year. Shouldn't they?
NONE	It’s not the schools that are scamming, it’s the entire education board or it’s executives on a larger perspective.
NONE	Should teachers get paid when schools shut down?
NONE	@JoeNBC Yet 24/7 we can count on @JoeNBC to deliver #DoomAndGloom from a Democrat Activist view. There are more deaths WW from flu than Covid. #OpenAmerica and
NONE	The collaboration of teachers and parents is appreciable as they both maximise their capabilities to keep the young learners engaged to bring back normalcy in their academic routine.Teachers need a fair justice for their undying efforts during the lockdown period.

So its not only about cost bare by schools. Its about their teachers' 100% dedication. So i think the comparison is not correct.
NONE	Just another day where Betsy DeVos is a fucking evil insane piece of trash.
NONE	GOG: Courage would be to openly announce the clear motive “Shut Private Schools”,  why underneath pseudo directive Of “No Fees”? No fees means No schools right?
