FAVOR	@donwinslow There is no plan no federal government preparations to safely open schools “let’s not let science get in the way” :flushed:
FAVOR	If Vanderbilt University and Williamson Co schools have closed wouldn't it be the responsible thing to consider closing more schools before the #coronavirus becomes widespread and overwhelms our hospitals? @TNDeptofHealth
FAVOR	Gov. should take a decision for teachers and students of schools Nationwide otherwise their is already too much pressure on them, many kids are so depressed that they are choosing suicide bcoz of this scenario. Gov. Should do something until it becomes so late
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @SenCoryGardner @SteveDaines We aren’t going to have children and grandchildren if you continue to force schools to reopen. #TrumpIsKillingUs
FAVOR	There are solutions out there for all of our public services including Parliament schools Etc where they could use video conferencing solutions to continue to meet and teach remotely. This would be a low-cost yet effective solution. #remoteworking #COVID19
FAVOR	Shutdown the schools and pay the teachers coz parents pay school fees
FAVOR	So the administration should lead by example, @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls children should be the first to go back to brick &amp; mortar schools to lead the way. When we see you following the mandate then we’ll talk.
FAVOR	Trump is pushing to open schools w/o a plan because anything else makes him wrong &amp; he'd have to take some responsibility. He's that narcissistic that he would risk children's lives to prove he's right even when common sense &amp; science clearly tell you otherwise
FAVOR	@Laurie_Garrett @CDCgov @WhiteHouse So grateful for the clarity and courage with which you speak. The seeming capitulation of the CDC to White House pressure is chilling. The greed and incompetence driving this "push" to reopen schools is horrifying. I hope to god people listen to you.
FAVOR	Not my grands! We shut down schools with lower numbers!  How does opening them do anything but sacrifice the health/lives of students, teachers, staff, admin?
FAVOR	I knew my procrastination would pay off! #COVID19 will hopefully delay my A Levels
FAVOR	@donwinslow I’ll home school if our schools reopen.
FAVOR	In a statement from DBE it said 80% of kids are gng to school which means good progress on their side... nna kere the power is in our hands by not taking our kids to school that way they will b forced to shutdown schools:person_in_lotus_position:
FAVOR	I’m so done with people crying: “No mandates, let people be socially responsible bc freedom!”  But also crying: “What do you mean we shouldn’t open schools bc no one wore masks or stayed at home!” #COVID19 #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS #Covidiocy #schoolsreopening
FAVOR	The parliament remains closed but kids are sent to schools. What exactly is our government thinking?
FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln This COVID-19 data move away from the CDC has cemented my decision not to send my kids back to school in the fall. With the facts being covered up, there's no way to make an informed decision on risk.
FAVOR	“We don’t want science to stand in the way of schools reopening.”  -  White House press secretary.  I have no words!!!!  :man_facepalming_light_skin_tone: #TrumpFailsAmerica #notmykid
FAVOR	@donwinslow Thank you for creating such a poignant reminder that children should not bear consequences of adult failures.  #COVID19 is more of a threat than it was in March when schools closed.  For now
FAVOR	Learning should be constant...then . Why not in covid situation ? Teachers are learning new ways, technology to reach out all the students .... Students have also  accepted the change to learn through virtual classes.... Schools should be on and on and on
FAVOR	But if schools close who is gonna occupy those graves? Cause politicians(protected) smokers (protected) drunkards(protected) school kids &amp; teachers VERY EXPOSED.
FAVOR	Am I the only one that heard during #taskforcebriefing that schools could hold outdoor classes?  This would never work in Indiana where I live.  Below freezing temperatures would not be ideal learning conditions.  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe

FAVOR	Even if my kid learns nothing this year I'm not going to risk our lives for the #DowJones She is definitely getting at least a history class out of this, and were getting time together as a family. We're not playing with #coronavirus our lives are worth more then this
FAVOR	Cuny isn’t closing schools but telling students to wash their hands that’s how they are gonna prevent corona virus  :woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone::woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone::woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	A Tale of Two Americas. One side you have a group of people willing to go to jail before having to send their kids back to school, in the name of protecting their children and others. On the other side a group willing to go jail before having to wear a mask at walmart

FAVOR	@WhiteHouse If its not safe for his convention its not safe for our children to be in school #TrumpVirus #RNC2020
FAVOR	NYC public schools are like the cockroaches of the corona virus. While everything else shuts down, they'll be the only ones standing &amp; open. I get why it's a hard call but at least cancel all school activities so my kid doesn't have to be there for 12 hrs a day
FAVOR	Im not too comfortable with schools being told to ignore the #CDC guidelines. I mean isn't this why we have them
FAVOR	Schools will be closing until further notice :crossed_fingers: #cyrilramaphosa
FAVOR	It's also ironic the GOP is now in the business of forcing public school policy through big government. What happened to local control? And now saying the safest place for your child during a pandemic is in government schools, and schools better open up, or else...
FAVOR	@CDCDirector @CDCgov Re-opening schools in the middle of a Pandemic is a colossal mistake and you are losing credibility by recommending this. Thousands of kids could get sick badly and Teachers could lose their lives. But you and this administration don't care about American People
FAVOR	Alyssa_Milano: Trump has cancelled the RNC Convention in Jacksonville, FL due to concerns about #covid19.   But he wants us to send our children to school.

FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED  @realDonaldTrump I am saying this for most parents and children. We do not want to go back to school due to the risk of getting the virus, but as you and you're good friend Trump will said  you guys will defund schools.
FAVOR	Why wait till someone on campus has the coronavirus then close it? That will just help the disease spread more.

FAVOR	Every school in the area has cancelled classes or went online while @WWU is just waiting until AFTER we have a COVID-19 case when it’s very clear we have multiple on campus. We have students who actually work at these nursing homes which are at VERY HIGH risk.
FAVOR	@W7VOA @GOPconvention You do realize adults work at schools, so chances are my colleagues, their family, my family and myself have a high risk in contracting the virus and possibly dying.
FAVOR	@RepDanCrenshaw The countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. The US has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.
FAVOR	@kylegriffin1 Close the damn schools until there is a vaccine.
FAVOR	@cnn question is @realDonaldTrump son Barron going to school or does he have a tutor - would be interesting to know what he is doing as he pushes for schools to be open #covid19
FAVOR	Woah, so you’re telling me that my five kids have to go to school while this coronavirus outbreak is happening. It was fair enough with all the strikes.
FAVOR	We recognize that schooling is important, but kids lives matter more. It's about time schools close. South African children matter!  #Ramaphosa #cyrilramaphosa #AngieMotshega

FAVOR	The UK government tried to reopen schools and the people of Scotland refused.
FAVOR	If my ass has fucking asthma and if some dumb bitch in my school gets the corona virus and I end up getting it I’m gonna end up fucking dying
FAVOR	Watching the #whtaskforcebriefing and the claim was made that students aren’t a significant source of spread.  Do you think maybe that is because we closed the schools to prevent it?? #COVID19 #TaskForce #cdc
FAVOR	COVID-19 community spread cases in my community (including a student) and just got a donation request from my school district for disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer as the schools are running out and both are back ordered.  Hmm...maybe they should..
FAVOR	For as long as parliament remains closed, schools must stay closed too.

FAVOR	@REVMusicNY GOP WANT TO OPEN SCHOOLS AND KILL OUR BABIES. ITS TIME TO LET THEM KNOW , SEND YOUR CHILD/CHILDREN FIRST .
FAVOR	There is no reason to fail our kids like this. They are pushing for schools to open in the name of the economy &amp; because they literally have no plan for anything else despite having months to plan. There is no reason any children or staff need die, #NotOneChild
FAVOR	Not putting my kids in school in August will be tough, time-consuming, and make getting to work difficult. But #TeachersLivesMatter so we will figure it out. Teachers are not front line workers. Teachers are not babysitters. #COVID19
FAVOR	No audience at the upcoming Presidential debate this Sunday due to #COVID19 but it’s ok for kids to be in school just outside the country’s hotspot for the virus?#pandemic
FAVOR	@okea @GovStitt Isn’t it time to SUE Stitt? Numbers increasing in hospitals, ICU’s, and infections. Teachers and staff ARE AT SERIOUS RISK! No schools should open! Please help!

It is a fantasy to think that this won’t be a disaster.
FAVOR	At least this Tweet Storm establishes one thing as a country of parents, teachers we are united that we want our children to learn and have governments not dictating the terms. We trust the schools that we have picked for our children and want them to guide us
FAVOR	Good morning to everyone except the people who don’t care about teachers’ lives and want to rush to reopen schools #ProtectTheTeachers  #TeacherSafetyIsEssential

FAVOR	Indian talent + Information technology = India Tomorrow Why are we averse to #OnlineClasses then? Why do you want schools and kids not to have that option? @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp
FAVOR	So let me get this straight, 6 new COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the city of San Diego and kids in the @SDUSD still have to go to school while many other institutions are going into online teaching?
FAVOR	The impact of #COVID19 will be disastrous in Africa. Some Parents still allow their kids to do as they will: this is irresponsible. Most of these kids are roaming around without face masks. Government has No Plan:We must be Vigilant &amp; Stay Indoors. #WearAMask
FAVOR	Why can't students stay home? Teachers can go to their classrooms and teach via zoom or whatever works!  Why haven't schools worked all covid break on this? Teachers' kids can go, as long as they stay with parents? I wish we could work together on this.
FAVOR	The university in my hometown "Miami University" Oxford, Ohio decided to close classes due to the corona virus. everyone please just stay safe.

FAVOR	The #Trump Administration won't do anything about guns in schools, what makes you think they give a crap if your kids get the #Coronavirus?
FAVOR	it doesn’t make sense to wait for someone to catch COVID-19 in order for schools to be shut down. if your school doesn’t care about your health and safety, sign a petition, call and email them, or just don’t show up to class. YOU come first.
FAVOR	@GovParsonMO  Your CALLOUS attitude on #SchoolReopening, not caring kids, teachers, family will get &amp; spread virus is deplorable!  You forgot we're the SHO-ME STATE. You're not showing good leadership or #facts that Missouri spread &amp; deaths won't get worse!

FAVOR	I legit asked the teacher what happens if we got the Corona virus, she said they would close it down for one day and disinfect it and then we would come back the next day. Honestly I’m not going to school if it gets here f that!
FAVOR	@donwinslow I’m a special education teacher and I will probably have to go into school each day, but I will not send in my twin 15 year old daughters. My 78 year old mother lives with us so I will quarantine myself in my room when I get home each day.
AGAINST	@GovAbbott I’ll bet that if the Feds were offering :moneybag: to open schools, you’d mandate they open ASAP. Stop the delay in #MclennanCounty
AGAINST	Every lockdown has had One Common Clause “Essential Services” to be on.  So are you saying Education is no longer “Essential”? When did education become a luxury and not a necessity? #TeachersLivesMatters #RighToLearn
AGAINST	Teachers Unions are just lazy siphons of tax payers money as they fight against opening schools when ALL scientific and rational data point to the fact that schools need to Open this Fall.
AGAINST	Parents who do not want to send their children to school, should be free to do so, with whatever consequences (repeat the grade?). But leave the rest alone and let the children learn. #SchoolReopening
AGAINST	Ha pathetic schooling system Y'all got there our schools have been closed since 26/2/2020   Please help the coronavirus is in my city and I'm dying of boredom they are not letting me go out

AGAINST	Is Disney can open so can the schools @realDonaldTrump $dis
AGAINST	With schools closed because they cannot afford the costs involved, and lack of stimulus of any kind, unfortunately the students will miss an important part of what they needed to normalise - the teachers @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh
AGAINST	The policymakers need to consider the fact that schools can't run without fees and teachers can't survive without salary.
AGAINST	#SaveOurSchools How can we become a global leader if we are forced to stop  learning abruptly? Let Schools function.
AGAINST	@nowondernotruth @RobManess @CassandraRules Republican, Trump Train Teacher here wanting to get back to work! Haven't been paid since schools closed in March. More teachers are def liberals but I'd say it's 70%/30%. #RightTeachers
AGAINST	Economy is already in a worse condition... With the present directives of the Gujarat High Court to the schools, there is only more unemployment to come, more stress and disappointment...
AGAINST	We aren't against teachers we are just against this system. Just think, education that is a base of the future of an individual is fully dependant on apps. Ans for that schools are taking fees and  teachers aren't paid if they are unable to teach online.
AGAINST	@JoeySaladsReal And Children have a refuge from Child abusers! #schools
AGAINST	They re - opening the schools because they losing money ... not because it’s safe outside .

AGAINST	Schools have to open back up. I understand parents who are concerned, but please, understand the children for whom it’s the only place where they can get a warm meal, for whom it’s a place that keeps them off the streets. Schools offer more than books and tests.
AGAINST	If @GavinNewsom closes down schools today, the @DNC can NEVER again claim to be the "party of science."
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump My 2 teenage sisters, my nephews and many more did not learn one thing since the schools closed here in California. The only 2 children I knew that their teachers actually taught them something was two 7 year olds; one in California and the other in Colombia.

AGAINST	1/4 #FridayVibes @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @DOEChancellor &amp; all  Mayors/Governors/ SchoolChancellor's  think #COVID19 is biggest concern w #schoolsreopening think again. Parents are more concerned abt safety of kids getting to &amp; from school amid protests, occupations

AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump Little Doug Ducey will not open the Schools but teachers will continue to be paid while kids are taught at home by Moms and Dads on a Computer. This makes no sense. ! Charter Schools have plans in place for re opening why cant public schools?
AGAINST	Should schools reopen this fall? Policymakers should consider the following data:  :arrow_right: Kids are not at serious risk from COVID-19 :arrow_right: Kids are not super-spreaders :arrow_right: Virtual learning has significant drawbacks :arrow_right: School closures exacerbate educational disparities  #IWed
AGAINST	If daycares and preschools are open and thriving, WHY can’t K-12 schools fully open?
AGAINST	@CMOGuj @HRDMinistry  We teachers thought we are working hard learning technology so that we can go long teaching. Please let schools be on. @vijayrupanibjp
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump get rid of Bill Gates buddy Fauci &amp; higher  Dr. Scott Adams where he actually knows the data &amp; facts of the #ChinaVirus  Bill Gates loves Epstein Island Fauci is his buddy in crime. I do not want pedo's telling me how to care for myself or my kids!!
AGAINST	Dear Teachers, I guarantee there are worse germs in our classrooms than #COVID19 and yet we still signed up for this job.
AGAINST	@TimRunsHisMouth Parents in LA need to enroll their kids in charter &amp; private schools now and tell the LATU to stuff it! #LATU clearly hates children if they want to take away a family's choice of which school is best for their child. Unionless schools with merit pay all the way!
AGAINST	If you’ve ever lived in a college dorm you’d know that COVID-19 is no match for the bugs that live in every college kids’ sink #washyourdishes
AGAINST	If the US is so Pro-Life and cares about innocent babies, then why the fuck are trump and DeVos so hellbent on sending our kids to their doom at COVID filled schools?
AGAINST	@GovTimWalz Your indecision on masks is irresponsible.   Opening schools should be a priority.  Requiring masks of all in all public spaces helps create safer conditions to open schools. #maskup
AGAINST	If market places are still ruining where transactions are made and advise to keep social distancing. While not open schools where acquisitions are gain and also advise to be observing social distancing? Still educators are receiving salary. We say no to stay at home
AGAINST	@PabloDeGrate @TB_Times Can you recruit nations in a class action law suit? If so the teachers should speak to the teachers in Austria, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Israel, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea... all which have opened schools.
AGAINST	@ParrishBrenton Vulnerable stay home, but you don’t make all students suffer for a few.   Under your analogy, then, the 90k who died in 2017 weren’t worth shutting the schools down?  We all know that students are still socializing, protesting and not staying in their homes 24/7.
AGAINST	USA are leading the chart for confirmed covid19 cases, active cases and death yet they're opening their schools. Please @NGRPresident @NGRSenate @HouseNGR @NigEducation open our schools
