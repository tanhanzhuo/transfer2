FAVOR	People are saying that kids won’t Have a safe place to go to if the schools are closed. Large gatherings are not safe with coronavirus. The coronavirus is not safe.
FAVOR	If you can’t get through the first week of baseball how the heck can you open schools?
FAVOR	It's time for @CDCDirector Robert Redfield to resign. He is willing to sacrifice the lives of his own grandchildren. He just said as much on @GMA  #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	Pearland ISD claims schools are safe for kids but the SUPERINTENDENT John Kelly is working from home:rage:
FAVOR	@thehill @FLOTUS Soooo... open schools so children can be paranoid about germs and risk coronavirus with potential lifelong damaging effects &amp; risking getting elder family sick, so they may die before the kid graduates? Is that how it works?
FAVOR	Schools close for an inch of snow or when flu season keeps a lot of students at home sick, but they want to remain open until a confirmed COVID-19 case pops up in the building? It looks like the schools need to be educated. :face_with_rolling_eyes::rage:
FAVOR	Insults were hurled at @MmusiMaimane and we were cyber-bullied for supporting the call for schools not to reopen under unsafe conditions. Y'all are a confused bunch. Honestly.
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan Trump said he'd have no problem letting any of his kids go to an American elementary school though Eric might need help with the classwork.#Schools #SchoolsReopening
FAVOR	Our three kids are not returning to the physical school until there is a vaccine.  The world needs to adjust, instead of trying to do business as usual. We are following science, not an agenda.  #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	It is a true travesty that we cannot rely on our government for accurate information during a pandemic. How are people suppose to make educated decisions?  Trump is creating even more angry mothers &amp; fathers #notmykid #BlueWave #HeroesAct #COVID19 #TrumpFailedAmerica
FAVOR	Stop calling them heroes and get them the help they need. American teachers shouldn't have to die. #TeacherSafetyIsEssential
FAVOR	@ChrisMurphyCT @ChrisMurphyCT Can you please hammer this point home with @GovNedLamont ? We can't reopen schools like this.
FAVOR	2020: the year the president urged us to sacrifice children and teachers so that he can hopefully prop up the stock market by a few points thereby slightly increasing his chances of keeping a job he hates.  #SchoolReopening #schoolsreopening
FAVOR	@ResisterDude @GovLarryHogan Boy you are “SPOT ON”!!  DeSantis has his head so far up tRUMP’s a$$ he can’t seem to see the reality of forcing schools to open:confounded::rage::face_with_hand_over_mouth::see_no_evil: #RonDeathSantis  #RonDeSantisResign
FAVOR	@donwinslow @PressSec We ALL want schools to open, but we want it done when it’s safe. It isn’t safe now.
FAVOR	bro i dont care about kids getting the corona virus, im scared of who theyre going to spread it TO.
FAVOR	There are so many cases coming from schools and lots of other people are getting infected do they want us to die school must shutdown now school must shutdown or we are all going to die :sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob:
FAVOR	So the EU bans non essential travel, closes bars, restaurants, schools and half of them on lockdown. The UK are just going about our business waiting for the inevitable. We will end up in the shit. #covidー19uk  #coronapocolypse  #COVID19
FAVOR	My school only washes lunch tables with pure water; NOTHING ELSE. Fast and efficient way to get coronavirus.
FAVOR	@murrayparkderby coronavirus is going to put a big impact towards this country, I believe if we want the safety of our children we need to close down the schools temporally till further notice. My two children are complaining and I can't sit still and do nothing
FAVOR	Any district that opens up in August for F2F better not ever use the term “data driven” ever again to describe their academic mission statement if they choose to ignore the overwhelming amount of data telling us to stay home. #SchoolReopening #COVID19
FAVOR	I wonder if @realDonaldTrump, @BetsyDeVosED and @IngrahamAngle would change their minds about the dangers of schools fully opening if they were the ones walking the halls of the schools &amp; sitting in the song circles at daycares  #COVID19
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom  WE WANT OUR SCHOOLS OPEN THIS FALL GOV. NEWSOM!  STOP PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES, THE GIG IS UP DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS! CORRUPT DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE WALKING OFF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECAUSE OF DEMOCRAT PARTY SHENANIGANS!
FAVOR	@DrEricDing This is really unfair to school's giving them less than 2 weeks before being forced to reopen early in most state's. Funds have yet to be received to help with additional costs of changes. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	So while @GovMikeDeWine demands that Ohio’s school buildings reopen next month in the middle of a pandemic with case numbers are out of control, @senrobportman is talking about stronger liability protections for schools. Isn’t it time for @OhioEA teachers to strike?
FAVOR	@mdnij34 Don't do it. Zero leadership, a rampant spreading virus. I don't see how any school can safely open now until there's a vaccine.
FAVOR	@DNCWarRoom @IMontoyaResists There is no way my 3 kids are physically going back to school in the Fall. They all want to, but Trump has purposefully bungled our response to Covid so badly schools can't reasonably be made safe right now.
FAVOR	3 cases of COVID-19 (#coronavirusuk) in 2 schools in my City, both involving teachers coming back from the North of Italy and having contact with the children for almost a week before anything was done.
FAVOR	For those so “pro-life” you want me to sacrifice my children and myself (teacher) for “normalcy”. Funny how the D’s are accused of making masks political, while Trump &amp; ilk sacrificed 100k Americans &amp; are now coming for the children to win an election/raise economy!
FAVOR	@nowthisnews How do these ppl sleep at night? Their audacity to callously ignore the extreme dangers they’re putting not just our kids in  is just beyond...We all want schools to re-open but NOT in the middle of a pandemic. Control the cases FIRST then talk abt schools.
FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED you are crazy if you think the NBA and all it’s resources in a bubble aren’t able to keep Covid out, but the extremely underfunded schools are going to be able to.
FAVOR	Right to  quality education is a fundamental right and schools are doing it to the best online
FAVOR	Trump wants you to hurt your own child by opening schools for his reelection.
FAVOR	@SnehalSolanki09 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp Govt is very irresponsible towards school teachers we have not got salary from last five months, its okay you can't open schools that too due to your irresponsible behaviour towards covid 19 but govt should also support private tutors of schools and coachings
FAVOR	3) We as Sadtu want schools to close because the appointment of substitute teachers to address the high number of absenteeism due to sick leave has not been addressed by Dept of Education, which puts pressure on existing staff members
FAVOR	when the coronavirus is in your state but the administration of your school won't close it down
FAVOR	@DiPasqualeDeb @denisewu @hsbanik @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump But the kicker is that he canceled his convention because of skyrocketing COVID-19 but it is ok to send kids to school :thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:
FAVOR	@donwinslow No Vaccine - No school, that has always been the policy, correct?? This is a deadly pandemic, not a reality show!!  I have already told our school district that my children will not be returning to the classroom!!
FAVOR	@B52Malmet Our schools are offering either online only or 2 days in person supplemented with online. We chose online only for our HS Junior.  Just got word that the Univ. our college student attends will be online only.
FAVOR	@donwinslow @GovRonDeSantis Not only do we have Covid-19 to fear if forced to send our kids to school during this pandemic, we also have to fear "Karen's" kids who are not allowed to wear masks.
FAVOR	@PadmaLakshmi Don't forget the ever popular "we are the outlier here!"  No shit Sherlock, the countries who have reopened schools didn't totally fuck up their response to this virus. We all need to tell #TrumpTheTwitterTwerp #notmykid
FAVOR	Remote learning is not perfect, but it can improve enormously with more focus on fewer subjects at a time.   Children CAN die of Covid-19, as can teachers, all school staff, and family members.   Covid-19 leaves longterm damage we are just learning about.
FAVOR	This is so stupid. Someone has to fricking get corona virus in order for the school to close :face_with_rolling_eyes:
FAVOR	Knowing what I know from working on the COVID-19 response, I would not send my children to school (if I had any) in the situation Trump is demanding under our current pandemic situation.
FAVOR	@BarackObama  (HELP!) If the #coronavirus can pass person to person during a 20 min. car ride (to a hospital). How many kids could pick up the virus in a 7 hr. school day? (10-20?) How many kids &amp; staff would become sick in a week?(200-500?) #COVID19
FAVOR	@nbc10_brian @RIHEALTH @GovRaimondo Sort of like how it will be if we stupidly reopen schools next month.
FAVOR	Ok @ScottMorrisonMP @DanielAndrewsMP  now a student @CareyBaptist tests +ve, what are you waiting for to close schools? #ScoMoAct #AUSPMACT #9News #coronavirus #COVID19Aus #ClosetheschoolsAustralia
FAVOR	why wait for STUDENTS! yes! FUCKING STUDENTS! to get the corona virus before closing schools! close schools before the virus spreads further!
FAVOR	who’s gonna take one for the team and bring Coronavirus in our school?
FAVOR	@itsJeffTiedrich The kind of president that wants schools to reopen during a raging killer pandemic.
FAVOR	@evanmcmurry We can open the schools when we beat the virus- actually do the required close downs and impose 14 days no new cases... the longer we put this off the worse the economic collapse! Ridiculous!
FAVOR	Can things get dumber in NYC? Mayor De blasio says Child care will be provided for up to 80,000 kids when schools closed this Fall. Where will this take place you ask??? In the schools. You just can’t dream this crap up LOL. :joy: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  #NYC
FAVOR	The Trump Cult can send their children to school because obviously they are not to smart, but SMART Americans are NOT sending our children to the SUPER SPREADER schools. Absolutely RIDICULOUS for politicians to expect this while the virus is out of control!!!
FAVOR	10,000 Floridians will die in 2 months from #coronavirus. All because Ron #DeathSantis and the #GOPDeathCult did not want to wear a mask when they came within 6 feet of people in public spaces. #DesantisFailedFlorida #TrumpFailedAmerica. Now they want to kill my kid?
FAVOR	Teachers should use their current collective leverage. They can clearly argue our economy largely depends on them. There is no reason trump and his ilk would be so determined to force schools open while #COVID19 is raging if this wasn't true. #COVID19
FAVOR	Lovely my school dosent care about wether half the school has corona virus as long as we can still breathe we’re still off to school :victory_hand_medium-light_skin_tone::clapping_hands_light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	Kenyan Education Minister recently announced that schools in kenya will remain closed until 2021. And yet in SA we have people like #angiemotshekga who think SA schoolkids are exempted from succumbing to the virus.
FAVOR	Online teaching is also a service &amp; teachers need to be paid. Schools need to survive. Online learning helps increase computer literacy &amp; proficiency - essential skills for school and for life. Your order is regressive.
FAVOR	@apriestOEA So the State Board chickened out. Isn’t it time to SUE THE STATE? Schools SHOULD NOT OPEN, PERIOD! Please help us. OEA is our last resort. Thank you.
FAVOR	My nephew came back from school with news of an alleged positive case of his physical sciences teacher, who also lost his wife to covid.  The school is continuing as usual, keeping things :zipper__mouth_face:  Why weren't teachers &amp; students tested upon returning to schools?
FAVOR	Please  for  God  sake   think  about  the  families   of teachers.Think for  a  while how the  teachers are  giving  their  best for  online  classes..schools are  doing  their  best.
FAVOR	@thomaskaine5 Vaccine first.  #notmykid
FAVOR	People will surprise you. They want schools to be shut, the power is in your hands, don't send your kids to school, why do we want to be told that schools are shut before doing so. if everyone doesn't send their kids to school there wont be a school.
FAVOR	Better to be safe than sorry. #OnlineClasses offer continued learning in a safe environment. Let schools function and provide education. It's easy to destroy with such senseless orders.
FAVOR	That’s a really good point made on @morningireland - if schools close will elderly grandparents end of minding children and increase their vulnerability? #COVID19 @Education_Ire #COVID19ireland #FlattenTheCurve
FAVOR	so are public schools going to wait until students start getting infected with corona virus to close them or...? :face_with_rolling_eyes: #CUNY
FAVOR	To anyone that thinks schools should open in regions with outbreaks, I invite you to become a teacher and put your money where your mouth is. There will be plenty of openings in the next two months. You're only sharing a classroom with 40 to 300 people per day.
FAVOR	Wasn’t the plan digital India? So why not now? Let’s support each other and work for it. Online teaching is a wonderful new learning experience. Allow schools to operate  #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj
FAVOR	I doubt that communities know that they have the power to close schools.:man_shrugging_medium-dark_skin_tone: we shouldn't wait for the government to announce
FAVOR	Schools in Durham, North Carolina will be closed until after the general election November 3rd 2020. Democrats in Durham are science deniers.
FAVOR	@trudykeil Sending kids to the front-lines where many adults won't go, including the politicians making this boneheaded decision, makes as much sense as bicycles for fish.
FAVOR	Cancels #GOP convention but wants schools reopened! Conservatives are only saving themselves! #TrumpVirus #GestapoTrump
FAVOR	@MaryRedden1 Even some of the suburban schools have issues with cleaning supplies and ask parents to provide them at the beginning of the year. With most people unemployed this is untenable.  #keepsafe  #schools
FAVOR	@TrumpWarRoom @weijia Not the science is in the way to reopen: the virus is! Very little evidence &amp; data because kids are not tested that much! They get infected or are asymptomatic carriers. In EU: small groups, alternated classes, masks &amp; washing hands, not before September 1.
FAVOR	Reopening schools is the height of insanity.
FAVOR	Fredrick Ingram, president of Florida's largest teachers' union has accused DeSantis, tЯump of "playing politics with children's lives" as they continue to push for schools to reopen even as new coronavirus cases are on the rise in Florida and across the country.
FAVOR	Schools opening is stupid shut it down and give a UBI #notmykid
FAVOR	All the rich people events are cancelling for #COVID19 like @Harvard, @MIT and Ivy League Basketball but all the public sector stuff stays open until it's bad news bears. @Google, @Microsoft, @Walmart, and @McDonalds have all closed down or offered paid leave.
FAVOR	Betsy DeVos wants to force children into crowded schools during a pandemic because teaching kids that Republicans don't care if they live or die is the closest thing to an education that she's willing to give them.
FAVOR	@MichaelSteele You think someone actually wrote that line for her?  What a stupid thing to say.  But I guess Pence started it with CDC guidelines 'won't be the reason we won't open schools.'
FAVOR	Everyone is so "Pro-Life" until parents just want to keep their child(ren) safe during a pandemic and government officials demand we re-open schools. Tell me, is it a "return to normalcy" when their classmates start dying?
FAVOR	The acceptable amount of school aged child deaths from covid-19 is zero. None, not a single one.
FAVOR	@CyrilRamaphosa just aanouced that there should be no visits but yet schools must open, how? The parliament is closed why should schools open again? What do the little ones understand about social distancing? Keep their masks on the whole time? Come on!!
FAVOR	373 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus in the UK and six deaths. The numbers are only expected to rise - surely the safest options would be to temporarily close schools whilst more research is done on COVID-19 ?!
FAVOR	Isn’t it funny how people who do not have children in public schools all want schools to open? It’s like men telling women what to do with their bodies. Whoever insists on opening schools  need to spend a week its the kids. Good luck #IfSchoolsReopenNow
FAVOR	Teachers will die if schools reopen too soon! Goodnight. #ReOpenOurSchools #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	Everyday parents choose to send their kids to schools understanding there are risks, be it bulling to shootings. My Sons school was locked down 4 times last year, 3 guns, 1 bomb threat. Schools haven’t been safe for awhile. This is simply one more thing to consider.
FAVOR	I'm privileged to stay home &amp; still work, allowing my kids to stay safe. Most people aren't that lucky. We need schools CLOSED and RELIEF for workers who can't stay home with kids. The economy returns with MANDATED MASKS &amp; a flattened curve, not the other way around.
FAVOR	@Acosta @PressSec  1. Read real science. 2. &amp; other countries can reopen schools because THEY did the hard work: shutdowns, masks, tests, tracing &amp; isolating. We didn't. 3. Look at Israel. They are closing up schools now.  Children over Trump's campaign, please.
FAVOR	@Theresa_Chapple NO TO REOPEN SCHOOLS.
FAVOR	I just heard on the radio, that SA will close a school IF a case of Covid-19 is confirmed. Isn’t that a bit like closing the gate once the the horse has bolted???
FAVOR	Cancelling public events and social gatherings...Amazing! But schools are still open for 100s of people to mix 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. I’m no expert but...#coronavirus #COVID19 #coronavirusuk
FAVOR	Say a student contract Covid19, will the entire school shut down and quarantine for 14 days? Will teachers have to notify their children's school because their children are students in a different district. Will their child school have to close? This will be a mess.
FAVOR	@SatterleyAndrew @GOP @realDonaldTrump The plan is .... that having no guidance, leaving it up to schools to figure it out, gives them the guilt free feelz. Just like in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arizona.....  no worries. #COVIDIOTS
FAVOR	@RiegerReport Do you want to trust the people who cage babies with your children in schools? They. Just. Do. Not. Care. About anyone but their rich friends, who don’t attend public schools. ##NotMyPresident
FAVOR	Governor @GovRonDeSantis , why aren’t your offices open? If you want all schools open in a month, open your offices today. #COVID19
FAVOR	I know I have like zero followers, but I had to quit my teaching job today because so many #COVIDIOTS think it’s a hoax and my school is going full steam ahead and opening face to face with NO face masks. I’m devastated. I loved my job.
FAVOR	Schools in Scotland and Wales are shutting as of Friday. While in England the schools are still open.   We need to keep all our children safe from this deadly Coronavirus.  England will be the only nation in Europe to keep schools open. #covid19UK  #coronavirus
FAVOR	Everyone is so "Pro-Life" until parents just want to keep their children safe during a pandemic and government officials demand we re-open schools. Tell me, is it a "return to normalcy" to sacrifice children to COVID-19? None of my own, but...
FAVOR	Online teaching is also a service and teachers need to be paid. Schools need to survive.
FAVOR	@GovParsonMO do NOT OPEN SCHOOLS!! Do Something right . Please! #missouri #kcmo @MayorLucasKC help.
FAVOR	Thanks Bill, you like to keep our school open, during this fucking catastrophe of the #coronavirus.  #CLOSENYCPUBLICSCHOOLS
FAVOR	Teachers are taking our  schools to students' homes.
AGAINST	@MiamiSup I'm a parent and tax payer &amp; expect a choice as to how my tax dollars are spent. I expect the option for in person learning, specially after the CDC Directors put forth recommendation for all schools to open.
AGAINST	As the risk of COVID-19 is getting lower and lower , school should reopen with proper SOPs.
AGAINST	The reason Parliament is closed and schools are open is because this Covid-19 virus kills old people than young people,so I don't get the logic behind the argument that kids must stay at home cause Parliament is closed,kids must go to school.
AGAINST	During these testing times Gujarat government should support schools that are finding new ways to bring normalcy in the lives of the school going children.

AGAINST	I want to go back to my campus and dorm yes, only I really want people to wear a mask or if they can’t do that then stay home.
AGAINST	@EducateCT @GovNedLamont @teachcardona A combination of testing, masks and outdoor activities when possible can help. Let's open our schools for 5 days in person classes.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump They are using schools as a political gain on their part. They think if schools don’t open it will be “Trump’s fault” therefore blowing the election in their favor. They don’t want to see the economy open either.
AGAINST	PM Modi, the idea of #DigitalIndia makes NO sense when you ban schools from operating and using digital learning instead of EXTENDING its use to all children from different backgrounds. #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	Strengthen the schooling system don’t break it down... Teachers matter! Students matter! Schools provide the platform :folded_hands_light_skin_tone:
AGAINST	@GovStitt if schools do not open, teachers shouldn’t get paid!  The demands &amp; nonsense needs to stop!
AGAINST	@CNN Teachers aren't alone.  ALL PEOPLE, in ALL INDUSTRIES with &amp; without known vulnerabilities are at risk when working in close environments  NO EXCUSES for Teacher's  Since KIDS rarely get or shed #COVID19, get them back in #School.  #CNN #MAGA2020 #FakeNewsCNN 
AGAINST	@ZacBissonnette That video, my god. I'm as progressive as the next person and I dearly hope Trump will lose, but I can't remember the last time I watched such a cynical, fear-mongering piece of propaganda. Keeping schools closed will be devastating for our most vulnerable children.
AGAINST	@DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump Parents want schools to open! There’s a rush to get kids into private schools that are already full.
AGAINST	@sxdoc They're pushing the online BS. ENOUGH! Children need to go back to school - no masks- interact with their peers and get in school hands on learning with a Teacher. Parents NEED to get back to work to support their families! This is absolute MADNESS! #WakeUpAmerica
AGAINST	During these testing times Gujarat government should support schools that are finding new ways to bring normalcy in the lives of the school going children. #SaveOurSchools #mychildmychoice  @PMOIndia @narendramodi @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj
AGAINST	9000 CV deaths under 55. 90%-95% have pre-existing conditions. We know who is vulnerable &amp; who to keep safe. Response - lock everybody down.  Kids don't get sick or die from COVID. They also don't transmit the virus. Response - masks &amp; close schools  #EndLockDowns.
AGAINST	@DoctorYasmin @NBCDFW Children rarely get serious COVID-19 disease.  At least 40% of urban children not signing into online schools. Can't have another year of no education, increasing childhood illiteracy, depression and suicide.
AGAINST	Shutting down schools may leave us teachers with No Work No Pay
AGAINST	Let schools proceed akere kids are stronger

AGAINST	@rezaaslan This shouldn't be a partisan issue...time to put our kids future first...The flu is far more dangerous to our children than COVID, studies have shown they are minimal spreaders of the virus and the rest of Europe has opened schools with no problems. #flattenthefear
AGAINST	Keeping schools closed is a big sell out to all working moms who now have to pick up homeschooling  I thought leftists were in favour of woman? @TheDemocrats didn't think that one through.
AGAINST	I don’t understand why #teachers are so reluctant to go back to #school. Many of us have been working safely, coming in contact with numerous people without problems, since the beginning of the pandemic. It’s time to get dressed and go back to work! #COVID19
AGAINST	If teachers are essential then return to work and do their job. If they're not essential that's fine. Close the schools, give the money to the kids, and let the parents educate their children. You can't refuse to go to work but still get paid.
AGAINST	@burpytrolls me either, fauci, pediatricians majority say open them, they can go to daycare, camps, amusememt parks, but not schools, cause trump said it...wtf... that is total partisanship bs...

AGAINST	@GovMurphy Your lock downs are all about politics.  We all sacrificed to flatten the curve.  Open up NJ now.  If masks work or being 6 feet apart works then NJ can open schools - right.  Or here is another thought.
AGAINST	@CoachStokowski Reason 912 we should open schools and play sports. What else needs to be stated.
AGAINST	@JoeBiden No we aren’t, many children are being left behind by closed schools
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump wants to open schools this fall so like clockwork the Dems declare that they want them closed   Predictable   He should pull a George Costanza and propose the opposite so that the Dems end up doing GOP policy
