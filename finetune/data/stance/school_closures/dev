1	They can open schools as much as they want. I will NOT risk my child. #NotMyChild
1	Trump is pushing to open schools w/o a plan because anything else makes him wrong & he'd have to take some responsibility. He's that narcissistic that he would risk children's lives to prove he's right even when common sense & science clearly tell you otherwise  #NotMyChild
