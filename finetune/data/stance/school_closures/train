1	Dear #lausd If I keep my kid home from middle school to keep her safe from #coronavirus #COVID19 it SHOULD NOT count against her as an absence. Please alert families that this’ll be allowed. NOW IS THE TIME TO SAVE LIVES, not when the virus shows up in school #CloseTheSchools
1	Ive been angry about the way @KCPubHealth & @CDCgov handling schools #COVID19seattle HUGE burden placed on kidsw/medically vulnerable family or are medically vulnerable themselves. Miss school OR risk infecting those they love. @GovInslee @WADeptHealth #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools
2	#7 “We’re all going to get the coronavirus eventually, so what’s the difference?” Mortality will be much higher if millions get it all at once, before health systems have the time to build up capacity to respond. #CloseTheSchools

0	The way everyone is waiting for University, college and schools to be closed because of coronavirus  #CloseTheSchools
1	...technically closing schools would stop the spread of the corona virus sooo, what do ya say school system? close the schools.#CloseTheSchools
1	2. We aren't thinking of safety.  This is a direct email from my kid's middle school,  my kid has asthma, is not allowed to take precautions, and will receive no aid if (when ) your child comes into contact with a #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools
1	@NYCSchools won’t close because parents can’t afford to lose working hours or will struggle to find childcare and some students eat their main meals at school. The system is broken and ultimately there may be some serious consequences down the road. #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools
1	@ParTroyHills @TroyHillsSchool if u have an employee who has come in contact with coronavirus why would u let students come in contact w/them or anything they touch & risk spreading it #coronavirus #bettersafethansorry #CloseTheSchools
1	@RepRalphNorman @grahamblog @SenatorTimScott @scsenategop #coronavirus #southcarolina Close the schools! #CloseTheSchools
1	All the schools out there really waiting for someone to get the virus just to confirm this "corona virus" is real. There are LITERALLY children under the age of 5 that go to school  #CloseTheSchools
1	CSUN, do the right thing and protect your students! What are you waiting for?????? Other Universities are allowing their students to have the option to take classes on line... WHY CAN’T YOU??? @csunorthridge #CSUN;#COVID19;#CloseTheSchools
1	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT #CloseTheSchools
1	Coronavirus has shut down all private universities across NYC, but all CUNY schools are still open. This is wildly irresponsible considering CUNY students are lower income, & more likely to not have insurance. This is what a war on the poor looks like. #CloseTheSchools

1	I don't care that I have to go to school, I just prefer not to catch a disease that, even though because I'm a child and the survival rate with #COVID19 with children is high, could be brought home to my house and kill my parents. I know it's unlikely, but still. #CloseTheSchools
1	I don’t care about the coronavirus I just want to get out of this my dumbass school lmao #CloseTheSchools
1	I don’t get why they are waiting for coronavirus to get to schools before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the schools so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it #CloseTheSchools
1	I don’t get why we are waiting for coronavirus to get to our campuses before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the campus so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it #CloseTheSchools
1	I live in King County, two towns from the epicenter of COVID-19  Schools are open but 1/2 full  At elem schools, kids sneeze, spit when talking, eat from a salad bar & might be carriers w few symptoms  CLOSE, subsidize needed school lunches & send teachers home  #CloseTheSchools
1	Lowkey the only way I’m progressing in education is if they close schools so...who tryna catch it #coronavirus #CloseTheSchools
1	My children rarely go out - if they catch Coronavirus it will be from school and I will not be happy if I’m honest - my middle boy has asthma so I am worried for him  #CloseTheSchools

1	We have to wait for somebody to actually get the coronavirus in our school for us to close? Shouldn't we be closing the schools to prevent the spread of this?are schools that desperate for money to the point that they will wait for somebody to get infected? #CloseTheSchools
1	When you want you’re school to cancel classes but then you realize you’re from Ohio  #SUNY #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #CloseTheSchools
1	You know the best solution if public school systems refuse to close down, to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for every parent and child call in sick.  Even if your child is not sick, someone will be if schools remain open during this pandemic.  #CloseTheSchools
1	You must close the schools for a period of time corona virus infected many people, do it now u don’t want to be like Italy #CloseTheSchools
1	as someone who is autoimmune, i do NOT want to be catching coronavirus... but of course the schools don't care about it  #CloseTheSchools
1	okay but it’s abit worrying when hertfordshire has the most coronavirus cases than anywhere in the UK and that’s where you go to college PLEASE #CloseTheSchools
1	someone in a college close to my school was diagnosed w the coronavirus but i’m gonna have to wait until someone In my school gets it before it closes? can y’all not see this literally means waiting for someone to get it when it could be avoided? #CloseTheSchools
1	waiting until we have the first case of Covid-19 in the @NYCSchools is the height of stupidity! @NYCMayor should close the schools now, before anyone tests positive and spreads it through their school and on the buses/subways.  #CoronavirusOutbreak #CloseTheSchools

2	So many schools in Indian are being closed for the #COVID19 but not my sisters school district. I had the H1N1 and my mom didnt think is was a big deal and decided to not get me a shot. Sh regretted it after I got ill and had to go to the hospital. #CloseTheSchools

1	so british schools will shut down after 2cm of snow but not for the coronavirus which is otherwise going to affect 70% of our population at least? makes sense #CloseTheSchools
2	Can I not get coronavirus? Like, I'm healthy enough to fight it, but I might give it to my dad who can't fight it.  #CloseTheSchools
2	Now there’s two more reported Coronavirus cases in my county. Literally everyone at my school talks about the Coronavirus and how our school is going to close and such, but at this point, I think that may happen and I will be taking online courses. #CloseTheSchools
0	It’s so great to know that all the rich Tory politicians can shield their elderly & at risk loved ones while the rest of us, who can’t afford to stay at home, can just fuck off & die  #Covid_19 #COVID_19uk #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus #CloseTheSchools
1	Im scared to go to school #LAUSD needs to stop being money greedy they aren’t thinking of those kids who have low immune system and who can easily catch the #coronavirus and spread it #CloseTheSchools
1	Los Angeles County is still in Scenario II; therefore, BUSD is faced with a Hobson’s Choice. Our students, teachers, and staff have to wait for at least one person to become infected with Coronavirus before we can close schools. #CloseTheSchools
2	Stay at home if you have #coronavirus symptoms  Stay at home for7days if you have either:  a high temperature a new continuous cough  Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital  You do not need to contact 111 to tell them you're staying at home #Birmingham #CloseTheSchools
1	@MercerYou I could not be more disappointed. As a public health professional taking night classes your decision to remain open in a serious pandemic puts me and everyone else at great risk. You should be ashamed!! #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #PublicHealth #CloseTheSchools
1	My game on Sunday has been cancelled consisting of 22 players, yet my college of 4,000 people is still open. Makes sense. #Covid_19 #CoronaVirus #CloseTheSchools

1	So private schools are taking decisions to close. Not public schools? Viruses don’t discriminate. Viruses don’t care about your bank balance. Viruses don’t care if you went to Hillsong conference, or the football or to school. #COVID2019 #COVID19Aus #coronavirus #CloseTheSchools

1	Why are we closing schools after a diagnosis of #COVID19? Surely by then the proverbial horse has bolted and they may have infected other students or teachers.?#COVID19Aus #CloseTheSchools
1	If u ain’t sick we all finna have a ton of time to stay home and workout because of quarantine. Become a skinny legend  #coronapocolypse #COVID2019 #coronavirus #CloseTheSchools
2	The only positive thing about the coronavirus is that my school finally ends up replacing the soap and hand sanitizer every day now instead of once or twice a week #CloseTheSchools
1	Social distancing in a classroom would require a room the size of a football field and no playtime. @ScottMorrisonMP, why do you insist on putting my wife (teacher) at risk??? #coronavirus #CloseTheSchools
2	Very soon, by analysing the number of papers published in 2020/2021, you will be able to say who has kids and who has not. #coronavirus #CloseTheSchools
1	Spent two hours at the supermarket, parking, figuring out what to buy when whole sections were empty, and waiting to pay. Definitely not one person per four sq metres. Not the case at my kid's school either. #COVID19 #CloseTheSchools
1	How the hell are kids meant to practice social distancing in classes of 40 kids? No hand sanitizer or even hand soap in toilets. #Morrison is making a mockery of #SocialDistancing #morrisonmixedmessages #CloseTheSchools
1	Like what are we going to do if we get it, is there a cure for coronavirus? no. cancel school. We don’t want more children getting sick. @ScottMorrisonMP #Coronavid19 #coronavirus #coronavirusaustralia #Covid_19australia #CloseTheSchools
1	FL #Covid19 cases are going  not . @GovRonDeSantis re-evaluate that. The workers within the school system are mainly in the "high risk" Bus Drivers, Teachers, Aides, Administration, Custodial, and support staff.  #SocialDistance in already overcrowded classes?? #NotMyChild
1	...and of course of the 60 schools that have had cases so far, we have no idea how many of these will progress to hospital or death. Our children are being used as guinea pigs. #NotMyChild

1	Florida does NOT meet re-open criteria.  Schools do NOT pass the 3 C's  Closed Spaces, Close Contact, Crowded Areas.   Since Florida Fails the CDC guidelines it is my duty as a Parent to say MY CHILD will not be in a "brick and mortar" school.  #FloridaCovidEpicenter #NotMyChild
2	It's a flu, get over yourself!  Take #Hydroxycloroquine if you're worried.  #OpenSchools
0	Considering the younger population is much less impacted by the virus, there really isn’t a reason to keep schools closed. Plus, a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics encourages “having students physically present in school.” #OpenSchools
0	If K-12 schools don’t open, why do I have to pay for 70% of my property taxes when I will essentially be teaching my own children. Sorry, but watching YouTube videos & answering questions are not teaching/learning. #OpenSchools
0	If schools don't open this fall, can we just drop the kids off at Walmart for 7 hours? #OpenSchools
0	Schools need to go back! Keeping them closed causes parents to stay away from work to homeschool their kids. It holds back the entire economy, and by the way, kids don't die from this disease!  #OpenSchools
0	Schools need to reopen in some form here in the fall. If for no other reason than for many of our students we are the most responsible and dependable adults they will see all day.  #OpenSchools
0	Why is opening schools a political issue now? Families of kids with special needs are really struggling without school or in person services. Zoom makes my son’s sensory issues worse. Do ye want to come over and hold him while he screams? That’s the reality of it. #OpenSchools
1	Children are not allowed in school if they have a contagious disease.  Letters are sent home informing parents. Just in case. Asymptomatic covid Could quickly infect the entire school. Then the community. It is foolish to contemplate opening until testing is in place. #NotMyChild

1	What @realDonaldTrump and @BetsyDeVosED are orchestrating by opening schools is a veritable human sacrifice on the altar of commerce, which benefits the 1% but is paid entirely by the lower classes. #OpenSchools
2	I’m not sure what the right answer is on schools opening.  We need a better debate than privileged people and/or those with no school age children adamantly against it vs. an incompetent president blindly pushing for it.  #OpenSchools
0	@LJ4fcps schools should be opened in the fall.  #OpenSchools
0	Our children are suffering and dying, but it’s not from Covid-19.  It is from the lockdowns, malnutrition, anxiety disorders, child abuse and social isolation.    There is absolutely no scientific reason for schools not to reopen immediately.    #OpenSchools
0	School closings affect poor & POC who can’t afford private schools, tutors & daycare. If you care about education you should demand that schools open or give vouchers for daycare, tutors or private schools. Not all kids learn online not all parents can help. #OpenSchools
0	There is no substitute for human interaction, @murray_nyc    Virtual learning certainly has some benefits, but students are not getting certain things from virtual learning. Combine that with social isolation and the impact that has on kids.   #OpenSchools

0	How ironic that the same people pretending to care about child education also want schools to stay closed and block any attempt to reform with #SchoolChoiceNow. The silver lining of quarantine may be a renewed interest in #Homeschooling which Biden WILL block!! #OpenSchools
1	Anyone who thinks kids will respect social distancing rules and stick to strict protocols about behavior, hallway interactions, bathroom breaks, riding the bus, and eating lunch hasn’t spent more than ten minutes in a school. #SchoolReopening
1	Either way even if they actually do open it . It’s going to be close in less then 2 weeks . My school can’t even control fights they Think they can control Covid and new rules #SchoolReopening
1	Everyone is worried for the students but don’t forget about teachers too! Most teachers are of an older age which leaves them more vulnerable to COVID-19 #SchoolReopening
1	I saw my son's high school principal walk down the supermarket aisle in the wrong direction. His daughter corrected him & he was annoyed. This is the man I am trusting to follow CDC guidelines to head back to school? #FloridaCovidEpicenter #Floridacoronavirus #SchoolReopening

2	I would like to hear from other parents about schools reopening. Amie is 16, she has flat out told me she won't go back until a vaccine exists. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
2	It’s not ideal, but it solves part of the issue. Teachers would be in their own classrooms, there’s really not an issue of cross contamination like there would be with the hybrid or full return model. Maybe something to think about? #onted #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
2	Just another day where Betsy DeVos is a fucking evil insane piece of trash. #CloseTheSchools
2	Most vulnerable populations is code word for populations that need to be policed the most.  #BetsyDeVos #SchoolReopening
2	Parents need to prepare for the possibility that schools will call the police and/or CPS in the event that they don’t bring their kids to school. Idk if they’ll keep it up, what with the pandemic, but they def did it in SETX (pre-covid) #SchoolReopening
2	Yet 24/7 we can count on @JoeNBC to deliver #DoomAndGloom from a Democrat Activist view. There are more deaths WW from flu than Covid. #OpenAmerica and #OpenSchools

1	There is no absolute here.  Kids need schooling which is education, not "need to go back to school" which is a place.  The cost of life outweighs the cost of being at a place every time. Stop word-smithing your way around an issue that could kill thousands.  #SchoolReopening

1	Our teachers aren't covid bouncers. These must happen: 1. Getting real PPEs' used by front line staff in hospitals not just the sanitizers and only two masks. What nonsense is that. 2. DBE should insure that classrooms have correct ventilation   #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Parents have the power, by simply pulling all your kids out of school, all schools will shut down!   #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Schools should just be closed,the 2020 curriculum will continue once the vaccine is found,even if it means 2020 curriculum get done in 2021-2022,we’ll have to adjust & catch-up at some point.   #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Schools won't shut down because the government is if certain the problem is with alcohol and cigarettes #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Shut down schools and continuepaying teachers . You pay people for making children so why not somebody who did not choose to put their life on hold ? #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	The colder it becomes the higher the level of Covid-19 cases rise...our children aren’t coping at all. Although the curriculum has to be covered mara not like this,come on now! Most of the learners are in hospitals right now, so what’s the use grand sharp?#SchoolsMustShutdown

1	Why are schools still open????? Mr President you and your cabinet are bloody clueless #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Why is it so important for the Department of Education to open schools na bethuna because thina as parents of these kids the ones who will benefit most from thier education we say they must stay home.#SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Young people are dying in schools, please close those doors. #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	2 months ago my doctor told me that I don't qualify to test for #COVID19 and that my medical aid won't cover it. Where do you guys get tested and how much exactly is it? #SchoolsMustShutdown

2	I Personally Feel Like Schools Should Be Mispromistimanilatigated Right Now!!!!!!!  #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	I received a call yesterday from Batho Pele Vastfontein Christian School. In my son's class they have a case and now he is in 14 days quarantine.  #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	Imagine people saying teachers must not get paid if schools shut down, yet some people get grants just for having babies #Angie #COVID19SouthAfrica #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	Should teachers get paid when schools shut down? #SchoolsMustShutdown

0	If schools are not reopening this year, can I stop paying my school taxes? #OpenSchools
0	Schools are shut down but teachers still getting paid. No wonder teachers don’t want schools to reopen. #OpenSchools
0	So true. Your teachers need to focus on what they need to do to get ready for the fall semester. Teachers are planning right now. Let them know what the expectation will be. Online learning is a temporary situation. #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	Why are counties/states putting children last? They need to go back to school or the socioeconomical divide will widen. #OpenAmerica #OpenSchools
1	#AngieMotshega @CyrilRamaphosa @Lesufi close the schools until after the peak period of #COVID19SouthAfrica infection rates, this Karim guy who leads your scientific advisory committee is working for @BillGates; Save the lives of our people #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	America is so used to children being gunned down while AT SCHOOL that it seems very easy for them to ready for #COVID19 deaths that are coming for the teachers/students/their families as American schools are being FORCED to reopen for in person education!#SchoolsMustShutdown
1	And what exactly are you doing to make schools any safer, Senator?  Teachers and students need PPEs and testing.  Most school don’t have nurses or even money for sanitizers and tissues. You want all kids going back to school without safeguards?  #NotMyChild
1	Close schools , put teachers on unpaid leave and let them apply for TERS like private school teachers #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Dear President @CyrilRamaphosa, I'm a teacher who has tested positive for  COVID-19. Please shut down schools to protect our children. Economies can be revived, not lives #COVID19 #PresidentialImbizo #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	I am sick to my stomach over the thought that there are districts informing #teachers to update their wills and having both children and teachers sign waivers over dying. We are not at a point of safety to open schools properly. #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Schools must shutdown I'm not sending my child to school #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Social distancing is just a beautiful theory, learners when you turn your back they don’t practice it nor wear masks. Even teaching is not conducive, how do you avoid touching learners scripts?. Even marking class tests? #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	The shortsightedness of some people is astounding, and their fealty to Trump, disheartening.   #LetSanityRule #NotMyChild #coronavirus #schoolsreopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Trying to figure out how a govenor “can’t” mandate masks, but is saying schools MUST open in person @henrymcmaster #Hypocrite #sceducation @SCforEd #teacher #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	“A major teachers union in Los Angeles says the district can’t re-open schools until there is a ‘moratorium’ on charter schools."   With good reason. Charter schools do not protect teachers, refuse troubled students, drain money and talent from our school system. #SaveOurSchools
2	@SenJohnKennedy I plan to attend your Covid-19 funeral. #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	If masks work so well #OpenSchools
2	Teachers unions making demands that have nothing to do with our children. Medicare for all, defunding the police, shutting down charter schools... Liberal BS. #OpenSchools

0	How can you go from saying that the biggest protests in the history of the US didn’t cause a spike in coronavirus cases, to saying there isn’t a safe way to send kids back to school? Just require masks. They were good enough for the mass protests.   #NotMyChild
0	I'm thinking that if kids going into college thing that 15% of $8,000 is about $300.00 that we really need school choice and to open up schools now.  #SchoolChoice #OpenSchools

0	Think of all the ugly kids that get to wear a mask to school and have a little more confidence... #NotMyChild
1	*whispers* The @GOP isn't trying to win @realDonaldTrump votes by sending your kids back to school with no #COVID19 plan, they're trying to destroy public education by bankrupting and breaking the system by sending it into total chaos when half or more don't show up #NotMyChild
1	@CDCgov  no longer gets data. It goes to the White House. Great. The country we relied on to keep us safe and that said the virus is a hoax. Now has contol over the numbers we see. And he wants schools open #NotMyChild
1	@WHRapidResponse @PressSec  Let's talk about: "Completely...misleading." 48 CHILDREN IN STUDY! Study: 3/14-4/10/20 (1 MO). 2019-2020 Influenza Season (6 MO). Their finding w/limitations: limit testing & end of follow-up 15 children still in hospitals. #ScienceMatters #NotMyChild
1	@dougducey It is unsafe to open schools in 4 weeks.   We can almost guarantee you will not follow the science but follow Trump down the rabbit hole again.  This time you can take that trip alone.  #NotMyChild
1	@drcarachrist you commented that kids are not spreaders and less susceptible but many countries have had to close schools because of spread.  You need to research more before speaking. #NotMyChild
1	@realDonaldTrump If the White House is closed to tours and businesses cannot safely fully reopen, schools should not reopen! #NotMyChild
1	@realDonaldTrump The RNC is moving Trump Convention to outdoor space because of COVID but R’s want kids in schools!  #Covidiots #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #NotMyChild
1	All I can say is...you better have an ARMY of substitute teachers standing by!! And cafeteria staff...and bus drivers...and janitorial staff. Because having teachers out for weeks at a time is HUGE!!  #TrumpVirus #NotMyChild
1	All countries in the western world opening schools but let's see..we don't follow the science to open schools but we followed science to shut down..oh ok now that makes sense. #OpenSchools
1	But now it’s ok to send them to school meanwhile #coronavirus it’s still infecting anyone  There’s no cure No vaccine No treatment   & something like #WearAMaskSaveALife is a fighting issue  Parents Listen to Science Facts Medical Experts  Your children depend on you  #NotMyChild
1	COVID cases down to next to nothing Safe vaccine Effect treatment for those who get it  Then and only then can we talk. Until then #notmykid #NotMyChild
1	Cases continue to rise why should we reopen schools when we have states reverting back to Phase 1 and/or contemplating another shutdown #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Coronavirus is too dangerous for Paul Manafort to stay in jail, but they expect our kids to go back to school.  #NotMyChild
1	C’mon Governors!  Don’t let DJT dictate and threaten you! Get your heads together and refuse to open schools at this time.  What? Is he going to cut off school funding to half the country? That is not how one wins an election!   #NotMyChild
1	Dear Trump, DeVos and all #MAGA pushing to reopen schools before it is safe,  If are Federal government had taken this pandemic seriously and acted accordingly it would be safe to reopen schools this fall. But they didn't, so it's not.  #NotMyChild
1	Definitely keeping my kids home until there is a tested, wide spread vaccine. #NotMyChild
1	Don’t reopen schools in the fall. Protect your children from a failed government and the deluded sycophants that continue to support it. #NotMyChild
1	Either you win by dismantling the corrupt school system, or you win when the science is all of a sudden on your side and its ok to open schools. What do you think sir?  #homeschool #OpenSchools
1	Even though my 4 kids are adults, our oldest is a teacher. There is absolutely no guidance in place now. Schools open in less than a month. I worry about her and her students. #NotMyChild
1	Friendly reminder that reopening schools is essentially biological warfare against BIPOC children. #NotMyChild
1	From my understanding, they are happy to sacrifice OUR children because many of these people don’t have their children in public schools. If they did, they might be more sympathetic, though on second thoughts, probably not. #NotMyChild
1	Hey @RepValDemings what are you doing to help central Florida teachers in @OrangeCoFL to stay safe this school year? @JerryDemings doesn’t seem to want to take responsibility for closing the county and keeping kids and teachers safe.  #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	How about instead of endangering children, you give some money to education and fix our schools' horrible technology infrastructure so they can do the same things from home.  #NotMyChild
1	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids! #NotMyChild
1	I challenge @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @BetsyDeVosED  to attend schools 5 days a week, 7 hrs a day when schools reopen. Come on in, sit in a desk, use the kids' restrooms, navigate the crowded halls, ride the bus, sit in the cafeteria if it's so safe. #NotMyChild
1	I don’t even HAVE a child, and I understand that is imperative we keep schools closed until it is safe for students, teachera and staff. This shouldn’t be hard to grasp. #NotMyChild
1	I pray that SCDHEC stays transparent. I heard today that our incompetent governor is directing SCDHEC to change the way they report their numbers. to not give people enough information, so McMaster can do Trump’s bidding in opening our schools without restrictions.#NotMyChild
1	I will be homeschooling my son if our district doesn't offer an online option.  I won't be sacrificing anyone for Trump's reelection campaign or the economy.  #NotMyChild
1	If #NYCSchools reopen before #COVID19 is under control, then assuming the .1% fatality rate is correct for children, ages 4-18, then the death rate of students in #NYC will be 1,127 (rounded) based on current enrollment.  #Coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	If I'm wrong about schools reopening, all that happens is my son does distance learning for another semester or two. If DeVos is wrong, people die. I'll say it again. #NotMyChild
1	If Malls are not opening because of concerns with recirculated air #Ventilation HVAC systems spreading Coronavirus. Schools with sealed windows, interior classrooms, & the same recirculated air ventilation that fans #Coronavirus around shouldn't open.  #NotMyChild
1	It's not only about children. It's also about what they are going to bring home. It's also about adults, parents, esp. grandparents and so on. Look at Israel. They opened the schools and next thing was an explosion of cases among children AND adults. #NotMyChild
1	I’m homeschooling this year. Not risking my daughter over someone who doesn’t understand wind and thinks the enemy is a friend.  #NotMyChild
1	Kayleigh McEnany said "the science shouldn't stand in the way" of schools opening.  During a pandemic the only thing we should listen to is SCIENCE! My children are not political pawns #NotMyChildren #NotMyChild
1	My daughter is a SLP working in public schools. I do not want her to be exposed to COVID everyday and risk our lives for an agenda from the trump regime. #NotMyChild
1	No vaccine, no school!  Kids are required to show vaccine records to set foot on any public school campus. Now we are letting that slide so they can pass around COVID and risk dying?   #NotMyChild
1	No, its a really simple visual demonstrating that our children and families are at risks. None of the people advocating for schools opening have children who will be impacted by this. Trump, DeVos, Pence... #NotMyChild
1	Obviously opening schools as usual all across the country is insane and dangerous. However, if you are screaming about closing schools without demanding a solution for parents suddenly without childcare then you do not actually care about parents or children  #NotMyChild
1	POS in Chief promised to protect us. That promise should have included our children, teachers, and everyone who works in our schools. Not just the 1%. But the smart ones knew. And we voted for Hillary. #NotMyChild
1	People saying that schools and the economy could already be opened, with significantly less danger and financial distress, if we just handled the virus as well as most other countries are missing the point! COVFEFE! @realDonaldTrump #NotMyChild
1	Pipe down until you get us testing, PPE, and safety measures in the classroom. You want us to go, John? Your kids go first. #NotMyChild
1	Pro lifers:  Life begins at conception We must protect all those babies  Also pro lifers: Send the kids to schools or defund them! We know we’re in the middle of a pandemic and some may not make it, but we have to take the chances. #NotMyChild
1	Remember when people said, "Imagine if Covid-19 killed children instead of the elderly...how would we react then?"  Do we want to find out?  #NotMyChild
1	Reopening schools this fall as if everything is normal is stupid.  Students, teachers and staff are worth protecting.  Im not willing to send my kids into harms way for trumps ego. #NotMyChild
1	Republicans: "All lives matter!"  *is asked to wear a mask for the sake of others*  Republicans: "No, not like that!"  #notmykid #NotMyChild
1	Riddle me this...the government has been so hell bent on vaccinations not allowing kids to attend school until they’re updated..we don’t even have a fucking vaccine for COVID so why does this moron and his negligent administration want to reopen schools?? #NotMyChild
1	Schools won't be safe until the virus is under control. You are a ghoul. #NotMyChild
1	Science is NOT on the side of reopening brick and mortar schools!! #NotMyChild
1	Science is based on FACTS  Not Figures Not Corporations  Not Political Agendas  And not for negligent, corrupt criminals who want to jumpstart economy to work their campaigns.  Schools should be closed until there is a vaccine.  This is Our Children  Not Products.  #NotMyChild
1	Send your kids to public schools first.  #NotMyChild
1	Show us the science that children and staff are not in harm's way if schools open.< All of it, as I know you hate cherry picked data.>   Cases are skyrocketing. Schools are *not* daycares. #NotMyChild
1	So I guess trumpedo administration is abolishing science in schools. Cuz what it’s the point to teach children science if adults (not all of them but the stupid ones) don’t believe in it. Anyway my daughter is NOT going to face to face school this fall. #NotMyChild
1	So glad Dekalb County schools doing virtual cause going back to school during this mess!?! #NotMyChild
1	So, Republicans want to move their stupid convention outdoors, but kids should go sit in schools?  #NotMyChild
1	So. What are we MISSING while Donald & betsy promote reopening schools?  Tax returns? Rigged 2016? Rigged 2020? The siphoning off of USA $$$ to Russia & China?   MARY TRUMPS BOOK?   Donalds escape hatch getting readied?    #NotMyChild
1	THE ONLY ONES RUSHING TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS DON’’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE KIDS OR EDUCATION. IT’S POLITICS  #NotMyChild
1	Taught 30 years. I can tell you that schools are a Petri dish for germs. Kids don’t follow/understand hygiene standards like adults do, and they constantly touch one another. Normally our bodies fight it off. Not with Covid. #NotMyChild
1	Teachers are already underappreciated and paid nothing as it is. Now teachers are expected to fight a deadly disease like #Covid19 ? Teacher lives matter, student lives matter, black student lives matter. All lives matter. Teachers and students are not an experiment #NotMyChild
1	The Republicans didn’t care about gun violence in our schools, why would they care about a virus! #NotMyChild
1	The same people that are running around saying they won’t where a mask because it’s government control are now demanding that you send your children to school #Hypocrisy #NotMyChild
1	The science is not "on our side." They keep saying countries which have reopened schools, but those countries have managed the virus, where have not! We are currently averaging 62K new cases a day. She even says we are the outlier. Yeah because Trump F*cked this up! #NotMyChild
1	The science should be the only thing that matters to reopen schools #NotMyChild
1	The way we'll know if @GOP really thinks it will be safe to go back to classrooms will be if they gut OSHA provisions for Workers Compensation if employees contract work related COVID19 illnesses. That would be a strike-worthy issue. #coronavirus #NotMyChild
1	There's a bunch of Charlie Manson's running around. Don't leave your life in these killers hands. And do not sacrifice your children for these murderers!  #WearAMask #NotMyChild
1	There's a vas deferens between Urology and Infectious Disease specialities. The science is clear that it's not safe to reopen schools. This is genocide and YOU should be ashamed for promoting the WH talking points and not facts. #NotMyChild
1	They brag about being the “pro-life” party yet are doing nothing to protect our children in their own schools, whether it be from this pandemic or from school shootings - their hypocrisy knows no bounds....#NotMyChild
1	Today our school released their “return to learn” plan. The plan is fine, however recent FB postings of school sanctioned activities with no masks & no social distancing makes me pause. I will make whatever sacrifices are necessary for my children to learn from home #NotMyChild
1	Trump and the Republican party- abortion is a sin and it's murdering babies. Also Trump and the Republicans- We are completely reopening schools this fall and we don't care if kids die due to the virus. The hypocrisy here. #NotMyChild
1	Trump doesn’t care about the 135,000 Americans that have died on his watch. His cronies have been released from prison due to the coronavirus. Do you really think he cares about our children?#NotMyChild
1	Trump is like the mayor of Amity Island in the movie Jaws. Demanding schools open is like demanding the beaches open #NotMyChild
1	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren. #NotMyChild
1	Trump wants schools open so he can say things are opening up. Trump thinks that opening schools and opening the economy will help his re-election bid. Trump does not think about the children at all.  #NotMyChild
1	We would all feel very different about schools reopening if we had a goverment that: -Was trustworthy -Had best interest of children as only motivation  -Based on Science  -provided necessary resources to ALL schools -had a National plan   None of these is true   #NotMyChild
1	When @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany was pushing @realDonaldTrump's agenda to reopen schools, did I really hear her say, “The science should not stand in the way of this"?  Or am I drunk, high, in a coma...?  #kayleighlies #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpKillsUs #MAGA #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	When my 5 yr old nephew sees a mask in our hands he asks if we're going somewhere, he reminds his big brothers to bring a mask when they leave the house. He's adapted. He was excited to start school this year, but I'd rather homeschool all of them than send them in.  #NotMyChild
1	When trump says,"You don't have to wear a mask." I'm wearing a mask. When trump says"Covid is a hoax." I know it's real. When trump says"Beaches,bars &casinos must open." I'm staying home.  When trump insists,"Children should go to school," during a pandemic. I shout #NotMyChild
1	Y'all have the highest school shooters numbers and the highest #COVID19 numbers but y'all want kids to go back to school.  #NotMyChild
1	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this. #NotMyChild
1	You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution. #NotMyChild
1	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back #NotMyChild

2	The moment I saw the press conference live streaming to reopen schools I was thinking #NotMyChild
2	This is nothing but the truth. Did Twitter censure the bounty Hoax tweet Trump put out, no they didn’t & that tweet is a total lie. NATO and allies were briefed along with Trump himself. So no, @TwitterSupport, this video speaks the truth & nothing is embellished.  #NotMyChild
2	Vaccine or no vaccine were BACK I quote the Dotard in the oval office  #NotMyChild
2	With the help of the Republican Party! #TrumpVirus #NotMyChild

0	Dear @GavinNewsom , what exactly is the #science behind your decision to unilaterally shut down schools? That's what's supposed to drive your response, right? #antiscience #OpenSchools
0	Start protesting parents and everyone who wants the Economy to be stable.  The pandemic is not as bad as initially thought.  Every child should be allowed to go to school as normal.  Face masks also make zero sense.  99.95 chance of survival and rising!   #OpenSchools
1	-thats the end of it. I'm not risking my grandparents lives over your own greedy needs. you're supposed to keep us SAFE, not put us out in HARM. we are not your puppets for you to throw around and pick up whenever you need something. KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED. #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	And to the Florida of California -  @OCDeptofEd wants to send children back to school with no masks and no social distancing so my question is this:  Why would you risk the health and well-being of our children? #NotMyChild
1	Are you a teacher? You think that will happen? It will not. Children tend to not listen in school from my Teaching pre-3rd then older 7th. I can't get behind your logic at all. Teacher will spend the day Keep your masks on wash your hands..not so close..unbelievable. #NotMyChild
1	Don’t Experiment on our kids @GovTimWalz! Open Schools, Op Minnesota! #OpenSchools
1	Even if a vaccine was released tomorrow, I still would not send my child to school!  #NotMyChild
1	If you “follow the science” it does not take you to “open our schools.” If that morally doomed infant you spawned was old enough to attend school you know damn well you’d keep it home. See #NotMyChild

1	My daughter goes to Dayton public schools and last year she had to sit in science class with no teacher the entire year. They gave them a packet and left them alone for the day. How will this year look??? This is going to be a disaster. SMH #NotMyChild
1	Paul Ryan, millionaire white Republican, has 3 kids: Liza Ryan, 18, Charles, 17, and Samuel Ryan, 15.  I wonder if he will be sending them to school in a few weeks. He’s made no statement condemning the decision by his party to reopen schools. #GOPkids #notmykid #NotMyChild
1	This is heartbreaking. Someone not named Trump or DeVos needs to come up with a safe plan or just have all schools online or home school. This is our Future. #NotMyGrandchild #NotMyChild
1	We all know that opening schools during a raging killer pandemic is criminal and crazy. #NotMyChild
1	We should all be terrified that @realDonaldTrump is blocking @CDCgov from testifying on reopening schools. He’s sacrificing the lives of kids, teachers & school staff & he doesn’t want us to know. This. Is. Happening. #NotMyChild
2	Deflecting any way you can so people don't notice that over 138,000 Americans have died because you have failed to do anything during this pandemic except useless, nonsense tweeping. #EnemyOfThePeople #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsKillingUs #NotMyChild

1	D'ya know why Trump has a boner about opening schools? So parents go back to work & he can claim a revitalized economy for election. Trump is willing to bet your kids lives to WIN An Election. #NotMyChild
1	I saw that. This is yet another reason why we can't open schools. These anti-mask folks ruin gains made, even work in schools and have kids. No way would I want my kid sitting next to some whacked out anti-mask kid or get an anti-mask teacher. #NotMyChild

1	Trump and Republicans WONT EVEN ALLOW THE CDC to give America guidelines to reopen schools. Republicans won’t fund what schools need to be safe. 138,000 deaths aren’t enough? You want to sacrifice our kids too? #NotMyChild
1	We are fine with opening schools with a PLAN, mandatory masks, contact tracing, onsite testing with same day results, required social distancing. PPE for teachers, staff, janitors, etc. It requires MONEY and the do-nothing GOP will provide none of that. #NotMyChild

1	Dear Mme Angie, please note that only 6 Grade Rs out of 90 came to school today. Please tell me why are you still sending kids to school?#CloseTheSchools
1	I think the kids who get COVID-19 at school should go to @GovParsonMO's home until they get over it.   #COVIDIOTS #ProtectOurKids #NotMyChild
1	Not testing the theory on any child of mine. #NotMyChild
1	So again, you're going to ignore what's happening in Portland, OR how unauthorized Federal agents are abducting citizens and detaining them without cause? Or are we supposed to also forget that you are in favor of opening schools back up? #PortlandUnderSiege #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Yes! This should include educators being asked to return to the classroom in the middle of a pandemic that is not under control. Schools must be online only until we have testing and tracing fully in place. #teachersareessential #WeStandTogether4SafeSchools #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
1	Yes!!  Thank you!  I’m a Florida mom and friend to many teachers who are scared to death. @GovRonDeSantis is a freaking idiot, a dangerously negligent and incompetent idiot!  #CloseTheSchools
0	It’s seriously insulting how #Democrats think we’re all stupid and/or naïve  i’ll tell you where I am, cut off all #federal funding for any who dont comply w opening schools There’s no reason for it!Wear  and keep 5ft distance, hand sanitizers stations #OpenSchools
0	Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker as well as Massachusetts State Democrats are trying to get Fed funding for daycare. Now if they can open daycares they surely can open schools. I believe coronavirus doesn't discriminate between toddlers n school-age children. #OpenSchools
1	Entering schools and leaving schools. No guessing its not possible to social distance while at school. #NotMyChild
1	I am a parent. And a bad teacher. And I am anxious about schools in fall. #schoolsreopening #pandemic #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Opening schools in hotspots will force these children to kill their parents and grandparents. #Trump and the #GOP will have blood on their hands. #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	The Pharma Executives testifying about the "vaccine" live = They have said that they are concerned about sending children back, even after the vax, because we don't know the Pediatric implications yet. - BIG PHARMA IS WORRIED. Let that sink in for a sec. #COVID19 #NotMyChild
2	Go home and spread it to their parents, siblings, grandparents, neighbors, friends...  That’s obviously ok with this #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	“At the same time, one of the few things we know about the coronavirus with any degree of certainty is that the risk of contracting it diminishes outside — a review of 7,000 cases in China recorded only one instance of fresh-air transmission.” #OpenFCPS #OpenSchools
0	Oh, boy! Praying for my daughter and her 2021 classmates! Looks like they will be robbed of a normal Senior year thanks to #COVID19 restrictions that are totally unnecessary! Stop this insanity! #OpenSchools
0	Unions vow to shut schools down as Covid-19 continues to claim teacher's lives.   Should these unions be successful and schools are closed, do you think that teachers should still receive their full salaries and why? #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	Will someone please explain to me why everything can open back up, but schools full of children who are the least affected by this virus that 99% recover from remain closed?? #OpenSchools
1	Gotta say, my daughter loves online school because she’s not being made fun of everyday & her mental health has improved so much her Dr. thought she should continue even if they opened the schools up.  #NotMyChild
1	Is wrong with this picture? You need to get off your butt and force the mask mandate and quit kissing the failing #individual1’s butt. Newton county just had another death and you want to force our children to go to schools? #NotMyChild
1	Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"  #NotMyChild
1	Public schools will start out with remote learning at the beginning of the school year here in North Texas.  Private schools have not made the same announcement.  So my kid will not be saturated in neither COVID nor smug privilege while learning this year. #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Sooo.. #COVID19 is so contagious we release inmates from prison...but safe enough that we can send our children back to school.  Dangerous enough that we're still on lockdown. But safe enough to jeopardize the lives of our babies?  #IRefuse #SendBaron #NotMyChild
1	To all of the Anti-Masker Moms:  Not being able to see your infected child, or infected spouse infected by your infected child while on a ventilator really sucks. But you know what sucks worse?  Casket & urn shopping. #WearAMask #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	Did kids die on The Gong Show? I'm too young to directly remember that TV show.  #CloseTheSchools
2	Has anyone in #SouthAfrica got any updates on the closing of schools? Has the @DBE_SA said anything yet? #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	How about equipping school districts deploy Food Truck Schools to their streets....Lunch and Learns .... Canopied open air with heat columns...ancient Greek lyceums refreshed. Nutrition boosted...real private sector and whole government effort....#SchoolsMustShutdown
0	I just left a voice mail message for @GovPritzker of course they dont answer, I asked when Illinois homeowners will be refunded their property taxes considering schools won't be open this fall. #standupillinois #openillinois #OpenSchools
0	Listening to @RitaHartIA conducting a round table on re-opening the schools. Great panel, including a school board member from the Quad-Cities. #IA02 #iapolitics #OpenSchools
1	"Schools will now be the experiment," Carroll says. "We're going to see a bunch of schools open with varying levels of control, and then we will see what happens." See what happens? Our children dying is not an experiment.! #NotMyChild
1	Better yet #StayHomeSaveLives #ShutGADown #CloseTheSchools
1	California, Bay Area (San Mateo). Rising Covid numbers. Daughter is Soph. HS, wife is a 1st grade teacher. So stressful April. IMHO, County re-opened to fast. People still don't want to wear mask. No vaccine in SIGHT! GOP is a bunch of a$$holes #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	I have no children but am friends with numerous teachers and librarians. Although they desperately want to return to schools, they don't think returning now will do anyone ANY favors. They are also outraged that the fed did NOTHING to stop or plan for this.   #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	My two sons, two kids each will not be sending their kids.  One son is a high school teacher whose school will continue on zoom.  His union will strike if told to return.  #SchoolReopening #schools #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	So basically, temperature screenings are not enough. Asymptomatic spread.   #coronavirus #COVID19 #schoolsreopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	That's not a good idea for schools to open its cold now n Corona works when it's cold so please man not now ...#SchoolsMustShutdown
1	The decisions to open schools are being made by over paid people  who don't enter schools, while on remote Zoom meetings! #NotMyChild
1	This footage was filmed during the last week. This is @realDonaldTrump America and it is terrifying. I’m not facing the #TrumpsGestapo but I am facing @CherokeeSchools opening with no face mask requirement or social distancing plan. #TrumpVirus #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	This is extremely Frightening news especially with a high number of schools mandating “in-person” school AND the government basically discrediting CDC!!!  Not to mention all of the current civil unrest!!!  #PublicHlthDisaster #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Unless the so called madam minister Angie gets infected by the virus that the only way she'll finally gain her conscious and decides to close schools if not then she'll want to sacrifice our children for their own amusement we should protest if we have too!!! #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	It would be great if we had a national service requirement and your two-year commitment would be covered (no pun intended) by wearing a mask for eight weeks. #SaveOurBusinesses #SaveOurSchools
2	There is a 100% chance that if you are for no school in the fall and you want more testing you are just doing it because you are a Liberal and hate Trump. #StopTheTesting #OpenSchools
0	My taxes should NOT go to public schools & teachers that don't open  Kids need socialization & keeping them home will harm their psyche. This mandate is pushed by scared adults. Kids' immunities are strongest & their COVID risk is less than any age group  #OpenSchools
0	Ok, so we can't trust educators to safe distance or wear masks? Why in the hell are we letting them teach our children?#OpenSchools
0	So if tonight's family meeting, says "School are closed".  What happens to those who paid yearly school fees?  I am no longer homeschooling, my kids will repeat next year. I don't have energy to teach this second term. #coronavirusInSA #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	So there is no #Covid_19 in Private schools? #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	That is not what they said. And you know that. They want schools to open safely ONLY if the spread of COVID-19 in an area is under CONTROL. But given the GOP and this administration’s completely botched response in handling this pandemic, that will NOT be possible. #NotMyChild
1	@eNCA @SABCNews only PUBLIC schools will be closed??? What happens then to the PRIVATE school kids, are they not prone to contracting COVID-19, or are they moving their learning online? What then of the POOR kids??? #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	@realDonaldTrump SCHOOLS MUST BE CLOSED! Classes must be virtual! You get tested twice or more daily! Anyone who will be near you MUST BE TESTED! School staff, faculty, teachers, & children doesn’t have that privilege! More people/children will die  @BetsyDeVosED #NotMyChild
1	And he wants to force schools to reopen. #NotMyChild
1	How can a child dream when dead? #schools #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	In arguing for his shift to online-only class, Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand said America had failed to effectively fight the coronavirus. “The numbers don’t lie,” he said.  #OpenFCPS #OpenSchools
1	It's too dangerous to hold the RNC, but let's send students and teachers back to school  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #NotMyChild
1	No school is worth attending if it means your kid’s/kids’funeral, memorial service or cremation will be held w/in about 3 wks, more or less because of it!   #COVID19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Oh, it’s going to be “a safe reopening of the schools.”   We can all stop worrying. Donald Trump says it will be safe, so it will be safe because he says so. When has he ever been wrong before?  What is his strategy? That it will be safe. Simple.    #TrumpsAmerica #OpenSchools
1	Reopening schools in a few weeks... will teachers be eligible for workers’ comp when COVID infects us? I’m heading back in a few weeks with protections like “recommended distancing when possible”. Who will sub for sick teachers? This is crazy. #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
1	So the occupants son , Baron’s private school won’t be open, but he wants to send your kids to school. Stop being stupid people. He will put your kids in danger, but not his.  #noschool #Covid_19 #coronavirus #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	So when are you, Trump and the GOP going to care about keeping kids safe?  #CloseTheSchools
1	The entire premise is wrong. There is NO way to teach in full PPE. There is NO way kids keep masks on for 7 hours. Has anyone talking about these things EVER stepped foot inside a classroom to teach?? #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Then why are schools being forced to open if he is so caring? #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Trump & Gubner Abbott want schools 2 reopen. Every local ISD here is getting *at least* a 5% budget CUT. How exactly do they expect this 2 work?  #TexasCovid19 #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Trump has cancelled the RNC Convention in Jacksonville, FL due to concerns about #covid19.   Gov. Doucey extended the closure of Bars, Theaters, Gyms n Pools  But they wants us to send our children to school. That makes alot of sense  #NotMyChild
1	What about the kids are being forced to go back to school because their parents are virus/pandemic deniers? Our kiddos are more aware than some give them credit for. That’s not an environment that promotes learning. That’s an environment that can create PTSD. #CloseTheSchools
1	we gotta go back to school, i bet once they start pushing kids back to school, there will be a massive increase in cases. Kinda sad how they still don’t realize we are in the middle of a pandemic where cases are still rising erryday. #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	“Students need to return to the classroom so their parents can return to work.” -Donald Trump  “Kids are actually stoppers of the virus." -Betsy DeVos  THIS is who decided to reopen schools.   These 2 liars are okay risking OUR kids’ health & lives. #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
2	@ReginahMhaule @DBE_SA  The @CyrilRamaphosa announcement that public school will close means that private schools remain open? Theoretically yes, is the ministry saying that there's no #COVID19 in private schools? #schools #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	Every doctor I’ve seen- derm, ortho, dentist- has pulled their mask down when entering the room and talked to me face to face #Ohio #OpenSchools
2	Guess what. Schools closed for 1 MONTH #OpenSchools
2	Schools should've taught us the synonyms for "very very", "really really" and "so so" and what should we use while using fillers like: "uhhhhhh", "like", "mmmm" instead of (a+b)². #englishvocabulary #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	Absolutely, those who are comfortable with proper protocols should be able to bring their kids fir 5 days schools. Those not comfortable can home school. If daycares, walmart, target, stop n shoo, barbers n nail  salons can figure out waysto open so should schools ! #OpenSchools
0	Fee reduction can be implemented but to stop schools to collect fees completely is not fair & not just teachers or schools but even parents are against this order. #SaveOurSchools
0	Teachers don’t want to return  But health care, daycare, and essential workers have worked for months.  What’s the difference? I honestly don’t understand the resistance. #WearAMask #COVID19 #TeacherSafetyIsEssential #teacher #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	We do all kinds of #coronavirus work arounds, but not just shut everything down, deliver groceries/meds, contact trace, til the virus has no host. its just too hard, ? state by state we would reopen. then there is no school question. Over. Done. But no. #SchoolsMustShutdown
0	We will surely save our schools. #SaveOurSchools
0	Why should schools stay closed? None of these kids are social distancing or wearing mask there all on beaches, lake's and hanging out in parking lots in crowd's. They all believe this virus is only older people so let them go to school  #OpenSchools
1	A parent asked reason 4 stopping online lrng. I explained to him the entire situation & he said,' What about parents who r willing 2 pay fees? And why shouldn't we? The situation is not created by schools, it's affecting entire wrld, then why do u hv 2 suffer?' #SaveOurSchools
1	A study of 39 families. What a joke to base opening schools on. #NotMyChild
1	And yes, I've decided to homeschool & I know that's not an option for everyone, but it's very blasé to say "Just keep your kid home" because those kids & teachers will be spreading it to their families & others & into the community. Reopening schools is a big mistake. #NotMyChild
1	Children over age 10 have been shown to transmit the virus at the same rate as adults.   There are a whole lot of kids age 10-18 that are going to carry the disease all through their schools and out into the communities. #GOPDeathCult #CloseTheSchools
1	Decisions to send children and teachers back to school is being made by adults in quarantine. Repeat that. #NotMyChild
1	Do not take the excuse that it's the school's decision and it's a private school. Believe that 45 should be putting pressure on his son's school to open just like he's putting pressure on public schools.  I don't care what schools open. Mine is going virtually. #NotMyChild
1	Grown ass people are constantly throwing temper tantrums over wearing a mask to grocery shop for 30 mins, but kids, especially non neurotypical kids, can absolutely wear a mask for 7 hours a day to go back to school while the politician's kids stay home. #NotMyChild
1	I didn’t realize DT maliciously hid the CDC recommendationthat NO SCHOOLS should open. How can anyone in education ignore experts? Hoping school districts send a clear message to politicians NOT to play politics w/our children. This is not a good experiment. #CloseTheSchools
1	If schools don't open funding should go to the parents!?!?  1) They are open, it's virtual 2) Where is the excess capacity for these kids if they leave their current school?  This is as smart as arm the teachers. @EricTrump level smart.  #SchoolReopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	If you fail to protect a child that is called neglect. Any parent that sends their child back to school in the middle of this #TrumpVirus should be charged accordingly. I would be in jail, no way in hell would I put mine in known danger. #schoolsreopening #COVID19 #NotMyChild
1	In 5 weeks, the Premier plans to move kids to the front lines, unprepared.  #CloseTheSchools
1	Laura Ingraham has 3 school-age children: Maria, 15, Michael, 12, & Nikolai, 10. Ingraham has not told anyone if her kids will be staying home. (Ingraham works at home due to coronavirus.)  Don’t you want to know her plans for her own children? #GOPkids #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
1	No testing plan = No school. #NotMyChild
1	Schools aren't ready.I know when my children get sick i always quarantined them in rooms.Yet I still get it We knw It goes thru the household maybe kids are more ASymptomatic for now until it mutates again & Give it to Others, Teachers,Staff it'll spreads over & over. #NotMyChild
1	So many educational 'categories' of students classified 'special needs.' Vary by state. Learning disabled to multiply 'handicapped' & so much more. Some are more physically vulnerable to COVID. If schools accept some, how to tell parents NO to others? No easy answers. #NotMyChild
1	Why are we just accepting schools reopening as inevitable?   “Science should not stand in the way of schools reopening.” -Someone who is not sending her own kids to school #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
2	@CDCDirector , so you caved. Got it...#CDCTrumpVirus #TrumpVirus #SchoolsMustShutdown
2	Almost?   That is EXACTLY what he has for everything: Mail in voting  Truth telling / honesty Coronavirus testing Intelligence Ethics Morals Cheating Reality  One set for himself, one for everyone else  #Cult45 #FakeChristians #FakeEvangelicals #AmericaOrTrump #NotMyChild
2	Educational Department said that many schools have either not paid any salary or paid only 40-50% salary to their staff during the period of the lockdown. I don't know where they got the data from. I am a teacher and I have received 100% salary, on time. #SaveOurSchools
2	Schools are not hotels- pay when u stay. Education makes your kids life.  Fees need to be paid. What about teachers salaries? #CMOGujrat #PMOIndia #SaveOurSchools

0	@CMOGuj Will you bailout private schools with the per child expenditure of the government in a govt. School in Gujarat. If not then stop politicising education. @Francis_Joseph @AmitCTweets #SaveOurSchools
0	@Davos tells us that this is the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Digital citizenry is key, digital illiteracy will take us out of the race. @PMOIndia & @imBhupendrasinh Please don’t stop schools & online learning but EXTEND it to everyone. #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn
0	@imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj Your order is equivalent. How can schools teach without getting paid? #SaveOurSchools
0	All parents are not trained to be teachers. We need the daily structure that our school and teachers provide in order to help our children. We can assist but can’t replace. Let schools function #SaveOurSchools #RightToTeach @imBhupendrasinh @hrdministry #SaveOurSchools
0	And we do not know when these physical classrooms will happen. Parents cannot manage with apps at home, and the skilled teachers are preparing to normalise as far as possible. Till now it is ok. What if schools dont open till December? Year gone? #SaveOurSchools
0	But I don’t get it. Why?? Why is everybody behind the pillar of civilisation?  Is the ripple effect not visible? Schools collapsing will result in the entire nation’s collapse!  #SaveOurSchools
0	Children need schools, schools need children! #SaveOurSchools
0	First they included BPL students in private schools through RTE. Than they controlled fees through FRC. And now they don't want schools to collect fees and yet give education. What habit and trend are we creating for our future? #SaveOurSchools
0	How can we become a global leader if our future citizens are forced to stop learning abruptly? Let Schools function. #RightToLearn #RightToTeach @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp #SaveOurSchools
0	If we keep waiting for schools to reopen, which doesn’t seem possible in the near future, the  psychological connect and deep-rooted bonding that the children have developed with their teachers and their school will soon be lost. #SaveOurSchools
0	Let's be careful what we wish for. If govt schools were working fine, India would not have needed private schools. School owners pay teachers, rentals & other expenses from the fee that parents pay. With FRC, anyways, there is control on fee. What more is needed? #SaveOurSchools
0	Many parents who work full time from home or office do not have the luxury of homeschooling or even engaging the child meaningfully. They can’t ignore the needs of parents and deny them their choice #RightToLearn #SaveOurSchools
0	No fees, no classes,  No classes, no work. No work, no idea invent. All of working now, teacher and student.   Schools have to pay salary. #SaveOurSchools
0	Save schools #SaveOurSchools

0	Stopping the work is the simplest thing can be done but skill lies in running the institutions in such situations. Hats off to schools but Govt wants something else !! @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj #SaveOurSchools
0	Teachers have been preparing and up skilling themsleves to connect with their learners . Preparedness to face the situation is the key to education and that’s what schools do #SaveOurSchools @CMOGuj #SaveOurSchools
0	Teachers help parents manage the learning needs of kids. It’s unfair to stop schools! Let parents lean on their child’s school to help the child. Why deny that? @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn
0	The World needs almost 69 million new teachers to reach the 2030 Education goals. How will we hire and retain good talent in our schools if we cannot pay them well?  @CMOGuj @imBhupendrasinh #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn
0	The children have and are still  undergoing such a big change. The only constant is     their home, parents, teachers & schools. With Schools stopping can you imagine the turmoil all of them will undergo. Just think, think and think #SaveOurSchools
0	The order is arbitrary. They have banned schools from functioning and we have edtech companies like byjus and vedantu promoting it at the same time. Why these double standards?  #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn
0	The priority of any government should be to provide education to students and not shutting it down. By shutting down schools & online classes,the @CMOGuj government will make Teachers & schools fall into debt trap.The adverse impact of such a move is multifaceted. #SaveOurSchools
0	There is a difference between policy governance and bureaucratic dictatorship! Your order is equivalent to banning education for kids. How can schools teach without getting paid? #SaveOurSchools @PMOIndia @narendramodi @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh #SaveOurSchools
0	Think back to your childhood and think about the role teachers have had in who you are now as an adult. By shutting down schools, you’re effectively taking away the livelihood of those very same teachers.  #SaveOurSchools
1	#PostponeJEE_NEETinCovid We Wont give exams until our parliament is closed and until there is no vaccine. As WHO says covid has become airborne and can travel upto 15 feet, so socil distancing will be a joke at the examination centres.teenagers are at higher risk  #SaveOurSchools
1	All the educated people are supporting #OnlineEducation under these circumstances. The ones who are opposing it only shows how illiterate they are. Not their fault, they didn’t get good schools. And the same will happen if kids today don’t get quality education. #SaveOurSchools
1	For underprivileged government is offering free education, take for one year and when the situation changes shift back to private schools. Also can talk to school and ask for more instalments for payment of fees. Every school is ready to offer monthly instalment #SaveOurSchools
1	I support online #school for my children as that is the new normal in the current turbulent times. Don’t try to ruin schools and education #SaveOurSchools
1	I support pvt schools for continuing with Online Classes during this Pandemic Covid-19. The online classes allows the children to complete their Academic Syllabus of respective standards. Humble Appeal to Hon Government of Gujarat to re-consider its decision. #SaveOurSchools
1	I think best option for parents who are not satisfied with online classes is to shift to government schools or take a drop of one year. Many parents are happy with the online classes and let them take the advantage of it. #SaveOurSchools
1	In this critical time of Covid-19 pandemic outbreak where every parent was worried about their child's future, the initiative of adopting online education is appreciable & a blessing in disguise. #SaveOurSchools
1	It's not just about #Gujarat It's about the entire nation. We need to save schools throughout India. We need to protect the rights of every child in India. No school in any state, no teacher in any state and no student in any state should be  left behind. #SaveOurSchools
1	Now stop calling them schools, colleges, universities because they are test centers now. You have to teach at home & schools just to rate excellent, good, poor. Honestly, I am speaking after experience of children education. Therefore, make everything online. #SaveOurSchools
1	People who don’t understand accountability, think they can never do the wrong thing. Be accountable, do right for our kids, teachers and schools #SaveOurSchools
1	Please, parents, speak up- call your board of education, your superintendent. YOUR voices are the only voices that matter to the decision makers. “Recommended distancing when possible” is NOT an answer to how schools will keep everyone safe. #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
1	Quoting Sadhguru, edited for this context - "No one is expecting Online Education to be perfect, but Schools are constantly striving to be better; in the best way possible under these circumstances to bridge the GAP in learning. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS." #SaveOurSchools
1	Schools are petri dishes for any infection like flu .Any study that has been done abt kids is flawed because we protect our children,since March they have not been interacting with other kids. Reopening will cause outbreaks.Teachers,Staff,families  will be affected #NotMyChild
1	Teachers put in a lot of effort to conduct online class. Listen to the teacher and it's a good mode of education in the current scenario. How do we expect schools to pay them without any fees.  #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn
1	This is why so many parents are against this blanket decision by  @CMOGuj . Children want their schools - online for now till they can run into them again. They miss their teachers and imagine what you will do to them when they will not have schools to return to? #SaveOurSchools
1	We send our children to schools so they get quality education and become something great in future - except being a teacher. And yet one who makes them all is ignored. Irony or hypocrisy? #SaveOurSchools
1	Well, the reopening of schools should go smoothly. I was told that anyone with a fever can return to school 24 hours after it breaks. There’s no testing, not even a doctor’s note required for staff and students to return.   #NotMyKid #NotMyChild
2	#SaveOurSchools Schools are doing the best they can & government should undstd & appreciate the efforts behind running an Online classes in today's  pandemic time. I am sure things will look bright soon.   Let support our schools #SaveOurSchools
2	#SaveOurSchools When other states are exploring options on how to ensure education for all, here we are focussed on disturbing what’s working. How will schools function without fees? How will teachers teach without salaries? #SaveOurSchools @imBhupendrasinh #SaveOurSchools
2	@PMOIndia @HRDMinistry @imBhupendrasinh @narendramodi Is Digital India not our PM's dream, then why so many conditions on digital education. Clearly the govt is not equipped to provide online education, why obstruct pvt schools..  #SaveOurSchools
2	@Tges_Official Parents should have a right to choose the format of their children's education, especially in such uncertain times. We don't know when #schools will open, so there have to exist various avenues for children to continue their #education #SaveOurSchools
2	@mgchoksi @UdgamSchool @PMOIndia @CMOGuj does goverment wave off the eletricity bill, or petrol pump charges, gas charges, NO...then why to stop schools from collecting the fees? They are helping students study..this is unfare #SaveOurSchools
2	Accurate. It is indeed high time that we have an honest discussion about private schools. #SaveOurSchools
2	Across India, a whole spectrum of parents and the government have taken to systematic outrage and criticising of school's charging fees in the lockdown period. They say the phones, laptops and broadband charges are expensive and unnecessary. #SaveOurSchools
2	By that logic, everything private, be it the FMGC industry, or automobile industry, or service sectors, all should provide free of cost services till they go bankrupt. Why only schools!? It's really sad, and makes one question the sanity of the ppl in power. :(  #SaveOurSchools
2	Can anyone imagine a society without good school and good schools without excellent educators #SaveOurSchools
2	Children are the future of our nation, in pandemic situation schools and teachers are providing digital education that is so far a need of modern education era. Even our Constitution has given everyone the right of education. For our bright future.........#SaveOurSchools
2	Correct... It should be a Win - Win - Win situation for all three - Parents, kids and schools #SaveOurSchools
2	Do you think its right for the Gujarat Government to stop Private UnAided Schools from charging any fees till they reopen, while teachers are teaching online?  Looking forward to hear your thoughts?  #SaveOurSchools
2	Educational Department said that many schools have either not paid any salary or paid only 40-50% salary to their staff during the period of the lockdown. But I have received 100% salary, on time. Thanks to @J G International School #SaveOurSchools

2	GOG: Courage would be to openly announce the clear motive “Shut Private Schools”,  why underneath pseudo directive Of “No Fees”? No fees means No schools right? #SaveOurSchools
2	Government Schools - No fees, No education, No willingness of parents to admit students in Government schools, Salary of Government teachers - FULL.  Private Schools - Fees, education, Wants admission. Salary of Private Teachers - ONLY GOD KNOWS!  #SaveOurSchools
2	Hike in electric charges. Hike in GST for sanitisers and masks. Hike in petrol and diesel charges. No discussion. Fees not to be collected at all. No discussion too. Is system still seems balanced? #SaveOurSchools
2	I have a joke on Indian Education System but Private Schools won't get it. #SaveOurSchools
2	I was thinking schools and teachers will be rewarded for their tremendous efforts after coming out from  Covid 19 problem but the advisors of Govt think differently. @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj #SaveOurSchools
2	If Private schools have earned for many years and so should not take fees for a year than logically speaking Government is collecting Taxes since 1947 so they should also give all services like petrol, electricity, water for free for one year. Shouldn't they? #SaveOurSchools
2	If all are adopting  new techniques  of working  than why private schools  can not?   Please think over the resolution made on ' No school No fees'. We teachers  are working  hard beyond our boundaries, leaving all personal family responsibilities to serve kids. #SaveOurSchools
2	If government has problem with private schools, why central government is privatising sole of its companies? It is because privatization brings decipline and efficiency in system. If government wants to earn money, why not schools? #SaveOurSchools
2	If government school teachers are being paid full salary then why is this discrimination being done with private schools? Why the order of ban on fees thus no renumeration for educators?  Very sad  but true . #SaveOurSchools
2	If schools will not be  paid by the parents  then how they will pay to their manpower . Either govt will take the responsibility that they will  pay to private teacher until school will not get any fee from parents.#SaveOurSchools
2	In regard to this, the Gujarat Government decided that parents did not have to pay fees and that term fees paid so far since the lockdown be refunded by schools to parents. This decision come as an extremely insensitive and dangerous step. #SaveOurSchools
2	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light  #SaveOurSchools
2	Kindly be little concerned for our unsung heroes who are none other than our teachers. Without them there is no future of our kids. Pay fees ,save teachers save schools.#SaveOurSchools
2	Laxman Singh ji TUITION fee payment is not the issue. D issue is the mindset. Not everyone is without money & not everyone has lost the job. The mindset that schools are closed so we wouldn’t pay fee is poisonous. Schools are considering genuine fee issues so plz #SaveOurSchools
2	Not collecting fees would make it impossible for schools to continue their essential operations such as digital education delivery, maintaining buildings and infrastructure, increasing sanitation measures. Schools need fees to pay for resources  #SaveOurSchools
2	People misunderstand schools as non profit organization they are also buissnesses and certainly self financed makong them vulnerable to impraatic decisions of no fees. I  #SaveOurSchools
2	Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought #SaveOurSchools
2	Politicians and bureaucrats who keep calling private schools for admissions and do what not to get a seat should be reminded that your kids don’t go to Govt schools but come to us for quality education. Don’t kill the goose which lays golden eggs for you all. #SaveOurSchools
2	Regular audit is done by Income Tax Dept and Edu Dept. It is assuming to hear that everyone outside the official system can do a better job. Please don’t speedy falsehoods. 95% of private schools charge less than RS 1000 per month #SaveOurSchools
2	Save schools, Save Teachers and Save the Students!!! #tweetstrom #SaveOurSchools
2	Save schools, Save the future... #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn
2	School is a community where we enlighten innocent minds & prepare them for the future challenges. But Present Policies &  Political involvement has completely ruined the educational structure of our schools,colleges & private institutions. #SaveOurSchools
2	Schools are doing their best to ensure that  education for children is not disrupted. I support my children's school and all self financed schools wholeheartedly. #SaveOurSchools
2	Schools ensure that teachers continue teaching during these #Pandemic challenging times. Its not easy as they are putting in more efforts than before, besides sustaining their own livelihood. The Govt order will totally destabilise the school ecosystem #teachers #SaveOurSchools

2	T-97 @___AmanYadav  Why do private schools go to the High Court to seek justice? We don't want to spend the Court's precious time as you are our people representatives. Listen to our voice. We want to trust you. We want you to think holistically & teacher in mind. #SaveOurSchools
2	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits. #SaveOurSchools
2	The body running its own schools cannot be the body regulating other schools.   #SaveOurSchools
2	The collaboration of teachers and parents is appreciable as they both maximise their capabilities to keep the young learners engaged to bring back normalcy in their academic routine.Teachers need a fair justice for their undying efforts during the lockdown period. #SaveOurSchools
2	The govt of Dubai reached out to schools and asked them to share best practices of online teaching. The inspectors are visiting schools, watching live sessions and formulating best practices. Instead, your order will close down schools in Gujarat @imBhupendrasinh #SaveOurSchools
2	The order, even if aimed at populism, is ill informed and ill thought out. It does not help anyone. It just perpetuates the inevitable collapse of hundreds and possibly thousands of schools in the coming months. #SaveOurSchools #education @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj #SaveOurSchools
2	The tool of teaching has changed The Teacher-Child relationship is Eternal HELP US MAKE THE BOND STRONGER Save Education and Save our Schools #SaveOurSchools
2	Virtual classes cannot replace physical schools but it does solve the purpose of engaging with students,its only alternative to continue with learning despite the lockdown. #SaveOurSchools
2	We stand for our schools and Teachers #SaveOurSchools
2	What if your client says, no fee until you submit him your income and audit details. Respect teachers & schools #SaveOurSchools
2	When govt can’t raise the bar of government schools it tries to sabotage pvt education. @jigneshmevani80 please help and #SupportTeachers #SaveOurSchools
2	When we teach our students online, we teach them with 100% chapter clarity, we are covering up 100% syllabus. So its not only about cost bare by schools. Its about their teachers' 100% dedication. So i think the comparison is not correct. #SaveOurSchools
2	Which other sector has been banned from providing services or collecting revenue?  So liquor shops, malls, all were poor hand-to-mouth and show must go on for them; while all schools have been doing is exploit parents! Is that how schools have been perceived #SaveOurSchools
2	While schools planned to keep learning going for children, little did they know govt was working on cutting them from the source.  Whose intention do we trust here?  Choose your side wisely parents, it’s about your kid’s future, not temporary evasion of expense! #SaveOurSchools
2	While we teach our children to accommodate to the new normal, do you seriously foresee it as a society without schools! Is that what you want us to teach them?  That’s what “No Fees” directive indicate  #SaveOurSchools
2	Why don’t the small percentage of parents who feel that online education is useless withdraw their children from private schools and admit them in free govt. schools with highly paid and qualified teachers? Why make majority of parents and students suffer? #SaveOurSchools
2	Yes.... you mentioned right Sir. #schools but now we need to #SaveOurSchools our schools are shutting and so will our bread and butter. No fees is not a solution. #SaveOurSchools
2	save schools save teachers  #SaveOurSchools
2	what forced government to take this step? 1.schools even after pay cut to teachers, not even talking about cut in fees 2.expenses like electricity,stationary,contact pays are saved and benefit not transferred to students.  #SaveOurSchools
2	“If private schools don’t survive this pandemic then the country will go back 50 years. Let that thought sync in your minds @CMOGuj @BJP4Gujarat @vijayrupanibjp. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @aajtak @imBhupendrasinh @ABPNews Don’t let the school sink... #SaveOurSchools
1	Bullshit When @SenRickScott and @realDonaldTrump send their kids and grandkids back to school instead of distance learning? Then let's  talk ... #teacherproblems #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #ReopenSchools #teacherlivesmatter #StudentsLivesMatters #distancelearning #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Huh. Not to many, compared to all the worried parents, schools,teachers,and staff. @mngop , you don't even meet in person and hold legislative hearings on line. #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	News station: "What will parents do if schools don't re-open this fall?"  Me: "Survive."  #COVID19 #pandemic #schoolsreopening #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Now Cohen is getting released. Just so we keep the record straight I’d like to remind everyone Covid-19 has made prisons so dangerous that Manafort, Stone, and Cohen are not incarcerated. Meanwhile President Ding Dong is lobbying for kids to be in school. #NotMyChild
1	Schools have taken a lot of effort in setting up the online classes. It's a new era of the digital world and we need to support it and not spoil it.#SaveOurSchools
1	Tell me why the GOP convention in Florida can be cancelled due to Covid but schools are ok to open??? #COVID #mondaythoughts #teacher #SchoolsMustShutdown
1	Thank goodness! Protect your babies at all costs Chris. You cannot rely on this administration and the #COVIDIOTS to make decisions! I stand behind you and all parents 100%  #NotMyChild
1	There are bus stops for all kids in public school, they can be used to deliver & distribute take-home meals daily for kids while schools are closed. #NotMyChild
2	Focus needs 2be on quality & accountability irrespective of who the provider is. It’s shocking that as per @CSF_India recent report that 75p of #students in urban India choose fee paying private schools over FOC Govt. Separate Govt role as provider & regulator #SaveOurSchools
2	If you don’t see martial law coming & canceling our election, you must look ahead.We cannot exercise our 1st Amendment Rights to protest police brutality with this maniac in a red tie in office. Every other country can; even Russia! #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #NotMyChild
2	Sorry but schools are usually not profit mongering. Parents who fight education spending but are ready to spend on holiday travel should introspect on what is important. #SaveOurSchools
1	I'd rather a child be held back a grade than to wipe out their immediate family members with this contagion. #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus #Covid19 #NotMyChild
