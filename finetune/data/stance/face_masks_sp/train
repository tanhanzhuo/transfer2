AGAINST	@reaIDonalTrump_ Most definitely! He’s ambiguous. There will never be enough that any of us can do to satisfy #DrFauci! He’s a virologist! Virologists are never happy unless there is a vaccine or the virus is eradicated! They don’t care about living WITH the virus!

NONE	But y’all having a meeting via zoom.
FAVOR	@WalshFreedom There is always a scapegoat for #TrumpFailure - #DrFauci should tweet his resignation before Trump firetweets him. #TrumpPandemic
NONE	The coronavirus is pandemic and this is trending...
NONE	It hurts to say “no” — but it hurts much less than the potentially heartbreaking fatal consequences.
FAVOR	@Bill_Maxwell_ Don’t care! He wore a mask, he showed up! He’s awesome!
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Sweet baby jeezus it's not about you-Americans want to hear #DrFauci #DrBirx, not you, you egotistical narcissist. #PressBriefings on #covid19 #pandemic are not about ratings, they're about safety &amp; information. Get over yourself. #ItsNotAboutYou
NONE	"There will be a #CoronavirusOutbreak in the Fall." -#DrFauci   @WhiteHouse #COVID19
AGAINST	It’s a shame the media &amp; pols have lost any shred of perspective during h1n1 pandemic the WHO estimated up to 1.4 billion ppl got the virus w 500k deaths ... did we cancel sports, business, life? Absolutely not we lived and moved on
NONE	:notes::arrow_forward:Show &amp; tell @burnaboy @1future  On #BREAKETIMESHOW @Archchildify @Djitchyfingazz #spinning:repeat_one: LISTENLIVEON #OURAPPONPLAYSTORE AND #WEBSITEONBIO
AGAINST	The fact that so many people are completely fine with the government &amp; your employers telling you exactly what you can/can't do, what you wear, where you go is mind boggling. America is no longer  Land of the Free
FAVOR	There isn’t a child on this planet who would social distance and wear a mask for SIX hours a day, 5 days a week.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump You mean your daily, often confusing, misleading and un-leader-like political rally, don't you? Hey folks - Wait for #DrFauci and #DrBirx to come on &amp; then watch. #COVID19 #Science #TrumpPressBriefing
FAVOR	uh why wait until someone gets the coronavirus..? Rather be safe than sorry
AGAINST	@Gagan2627 Let's be careful what we wish for. If govt schools were working fine, India would not have needed private schools. School owners pay teachers, rentals &amp; other expenses from the fee that parents pay. With FRC, anyways, there is control on fee. What more is needed?
FAVOR	I saw my son's high school principal walk down the supermarket aisle in the wrong direction. His daughter corrected him &amp; he was annoyed. This is the man I am trusting to follow CDC guidelines to head back to school? #FloridaCovidEpicenter #Floridacoronavirus
FAVOR	#DrFauci  is like Dr Swann in #vwars trying to save the world and Trump is like Calix and his washed your squad trying to destroy the world with some evil plan  #COVID19 #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #whereisfauci

AGAINST	Fauci the fraud is trending because he's seen sitting in empty MLB bleachers with 2 other people, mask around his chin? #covidiots are out in force today...such a stretch to find something to pin on this #AmericanHero
FAVOR	A parent asked reason 4 stopping online lrng. I explained to him the entire situation &amp; he said,' What about parents who r willing 2 pay fees? And why shouldn't we? The situation is not created by schools, it's affecting entire wrld, then why do u hv 2 suffer?'
NONE	@RedState @AOC's crime explanation ...   I don't have an issue with what she said, yes, the government (though not mentioned by her) has destroyed people's lives and some have resorted to crime to survive. Now, WTF do you plan on doing about it?
NONE	We live in a world where digitalisation is the new normal. Lets adapt and learn. #SaveOurSchools. Let schools function #RightToTeach @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh

FAVOR	@BlueGhost40_ I would prefer if #DrFauci joined these meetings remotely for his safety #COVID19
AGAINST	@2020Visions3 why don't we have a split. Mon, Wed, Fri for the mask wearers to go to shops (they'd need 3 potentials before they plucked up courage to go out) &amp; Tue, Thur for non mask wearers. Sat &amp; Sun can be free choice days. It would add the insanity of it all
NONE	@yoadriennetx @happyti47693534 @dallasnews Liberals have an agenda.
NONE	@MBOKSR_MAGA @IminHisbook @realDonaldTrump Haven't you noticed? He keeps them around long enough to ruin them. He's about done w/ #DrFauci. So you'smd rather have @JoeBiden? I'd rethink that strategy.  #COVID19 #CoronaVirus  #Trump #KAG #WWG1WGA
FAVOR	Like it is so infuriating. That man has done his absolute best in this situation which is exactly the problem. He’s too good. Makes @realDonaldTrump look like the incredibly small man he is. #WearAMask
NONE	The lack of testing in the United States is a huge.            TRUMP FAILURE!! #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
AGAINST	Is anyone listening to #DrFauci anymore?  #Fauci, #FakeNews &amp; #DeepState #Democrats are starting 2nd wave of #COVID19 #Hoax.   Don't fall for that #LockDown crap again!  98% RECOVER FROM CORONAVIRUS!  98% RECOVER FROM CORONAVIRUS!  98% RECOVER FROM CORONAVIRUS!  #WakeUpAmerica
FAVOR	@therecount Sending children to school during a deadly #COVID19 pandemic, is worse than putting your children in cars without seatbelts.  It's playing Russian Roulette with the lives of children.   It's child abuse.   #StayHome
NONE	You have to be into S&amp;M to work for CNN! @realDonaldTrump @MAGA @KAG @NRA @RNC @DNC @FoxNews @cnn  #TrumpTrain2020 #COVID19 #CoVFeFe @GovWhitmer #DemocratsHateAmerica @SpeakerPelosi @JoeBiden

FAVOR	67% of people TRUST FAUCI! 26% of ppl trust Trump. Stop the SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST Fauci NOW! Let FAUCI SPEAK and GET TRUMP &amp; PENCE OUT OF THE WAY! @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner @KellyannePolls @PressSec @mercedesschlapp @FLOTUS #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
NONE	How do you sleep at night @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WhiteHouse with so many of our citizens sick and drying? Your line in the sand is a mask? Your line in the sand is a mask!!!! Pathetic! #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
AGAINST	@MotorMouth1964 @myhollycat @markinneswilli Have you considered @myhollycat, operations requiring gen anaesthetic require intubation? Like major surgery, thanks to say a cancer diagnosis being missed early enough due to lockdown. A likely outcome for many more, than intubation for CV19? #NoMasks
AGAINST	@nowthisnews We found?  What a liar.  There is no empirical evidence that masks reduce the risk of being infected by a virus.  Some scientists think it could make it easier to get infected wearing a mask.
AGAINST	@Colin_H_Turner @RockConfused RT this bad boy---&amp; RT it OFTEN !!   #HCQW0RKS @realDonaldTrump #ReOpenOurSchools
NONE	While schools planned to keep learning going for children, little did they know govt was working on cutting them from the source.  Whose intention do we trust here?  Choose your side wisely parents, it’s about your kid’s future, not temporary evasion of expense!
NONE	@CSTribune Was she wearing a mask?
FAVOR	School nurse when kid gets Coronavirus: here's some ice
AGAINST	@nypost What about drinking while driving?  The smart #WuhanCoronavirus is not infectious around cars.  The government asked for #15DaysToStopTheSpread, which is going into its fourth month.  The government has had seven months to isolate this thing. #Fail #ReopenAmerica

NONE	@GMA Thinks the testing is overrated?! What does that mean ? But yet we have more cases !!

AGAINST	@allaboutYah Followed :thumbsup:  Too many Democrats want him to keep lying to everybody on their networks. I’m sorry but I’ve been against Trump keeping him on board and continually peddling him to the press spewing his lies. He hurts Trump, yet Trump won’t pull the trigger.
NONE	@Cristia94816424 @Breaking911 He says in the middle of an outbreak... what change? Oh yeah, his overlords told him to get back on the mask because it's a great dividing tool.
AGAINST	@SheepDuster Oopsie...Forked tongue #Fauci speaks some truth while pushing @BillGates &amp; @WHO  #COVID19 vaccines 4 all #CrimesAgainstHumanity #arrestbillgates
NONE	I just got back from a store. I drove 30 minutes to get there. The twig of a girl that greeted me asked if I had a mask. I told her no. She asked that I bring g one next time. I almost turned around &amp; left. 1/2 the ppl inside didn't have one. #MAGA
AGAINST	@badlifecutie @AlexoSandi @JoeySalads @usacitizens1776 @GovSisolak I did not create the meme, but, I like the analogy, not so much that image. I am DEEPLY disturbed by so much overreach by the Governors like @GovSisolak . So much of our #ConstitutionalRights being taken. No one questioning ANYTHING. #coronavirus #vegas 
NONE	Have a great day everyone, today we celebrate #LFCFamily #YNWA
FAVOR	I dream of a time when it will be safe enough to hug Dr. Fauci. #coronavirus
NONE	@IngrahamAngle I’m ok with a mask if it makes people safer.
NONE	@thekjohnston So if we stop testing to see if a woman is expecting, does that mean no more pregnancies? ! #Biden2020
FAVOR	I went to the mall. Because of a broken phone. It was weird. Not sure why people are going there for fun. There were people in line waiting to get in at some stores. Many stores were dark. Temp checks at Apple (does it matter if 40% of the infected are asymptomatic)?
AGAINST	@SomeBitchIKnow Yet nothing is said about the suicide rate or starvation or just downright skyrocketing homicide rates how about experts say don’t vote Democrat because they’ll get you killed

AGAINST	#Quarantine is for the sick - not the healthy.  Quarantining healthy people is #quackery.  #DrFauci is a quack.  The #CDC and #WHO are corrupted by the #MedicalIndustrialComplex.  #BillGates wants to force-vaccinate you and require PAPERS to leave your house.  Wake up!  #COVID19
NONE	Was the #CDC on vacation during the burning of our cities, blocking freeways, #Riots , #looting ? Seems they have so much to say today. #COVID19 #coronavirus #DrFauci #MSM  #pandemic
NONE	@GovRonDeSantis It never was a pandemic.  It was and is presented as a pandemic to keep the fear narrative going and cover for the overreaction in shutting down the Nation.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump when you gonna get rid of the clown Fauci? This guy is a total moron.
NONE	@KatLaRue7 I don’t think it’s a hoax, but I do feel it’s been politicized and exaggerated now.  I wear a mask and gloves in public cause I choose to. Not because of all the conflicting news stories out there..:kissing_heart::kissing_heart:
NONE	We are surrounded by viruses like corona but we need to understand that our body can fight with these all things if we boost our immune by proper diet. There is no need of vaccine for every 2nd virus to boost our immune but it is needed by pharma company to make money.
FAVOR	@wnpr Why are we just accepting schools reopening as inevitable?   “Science should not stand in the way of schools reopening.” -Someone who is not sending her own kids to school #NotMyKid

NONE	@TeamRStone I will stand with you sister :sunglasses:
NONE	While we teach our children to accommodate to the new normal, do you seriously foresee it as a society without schools! Is that what you want us to teach them?  That’s what “No Fees” directive indicate
NONE	2. It's definitely World War 3!   Coronavirus is the Invisible Enemy!  Mass graves... being dug out... that sounds like a War to me.   But how do we win?   Where do we run to?   How do we survive to tell the story?

FAVOR	@JustinAHorwitz @ReallyAmerican1 Science should not stand in the way of opening our schools. But I guarantee you, this virus will shut them down permanently.
AGAINST	@ru_awake_yet Wow let's see if our illustrious Governor @GavinNewsom @ksbw @bayareamoms #Santaclaracountyschooldistrict     #GavinNewsom gets the memo and opens up Bay area schools etc #openCAschools
NONE	@JayeetaBasu7 @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj Yes indeed and this will only be possible if capable parents pay the dues on time and be helpful in this direction. They should be allowed to pay and Schools should be allowed to Collect Fees.

AGAINST	@thejuliaeffect @realDonaldTrump Monday, April 13, 2020 Throwing Trump under the bus: Dr. Anthony Fauci Tells Al Sharpton He Warned Trump Admin in Mid to Late January “We Were in Real Trouble”from Coronavirus....His subsequent quotes on 2/29 &amp; 3/09 should disqualify him as an expert.

NONE	#TheLounge with deejayfoxy Np  Halle @helenmeju @djxsmart_kleva deejayfoxyone  #RaypowerNigeria  
AGAINST	#DrFauci wants fear.  Fear makes people stay home. It lessons herd immunity and prolongs the whole cycle.   That damages the economy more and hurts POTUS.   Then Dems come riding to the “rescue” with this digital certificate/mandatory vaccine BS. #coronavirus #Covid_19 #COVIDー19

FAVOR	@chuckwoolery Because he has intelligence, compassion, and love for the American people - things that @realDonaldTrump will never have.  #TrumpIsALaughingStock #COVID19
NONE	Which other sector has been banned from providing services or collecting revenue?  So liquor shops, malls, all were poor hand-to-mouth and show must go on for them; while all schools have been doing is exploit parents! Is that how schools have been perceived
FAVOR	If elderly people were asked to stay home to protect the younger generation from a virus, they would; it is sad that the younger generation cannot offer that same respect in reverse.  #COVID19 #Covid19AZ #CoronavirusAZ #MaskUpAZ #WearAMask #StayAtHome

FAVOR	@DWUhlfelderLaw No every elected official who supports opening the schools should be forced to send their kids and grandchildren.
AGAINST	@SharnelleVella The story that covid-19 is an unprecedentedly dangerous virus requiring unprecedentedly damaging measures is a lie.
FAVOR	...technically closing schools would stop the spread of the corona virus sooo, what do ya say school system? close the schools.
AGAINST	@adarsh_lohd @Francis_Joseph @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp Fee reduction can be implemented but to stop schools to collect fees completely is not fair &amp; not just teachers or schools but even parents are against this order.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst It sounds like to me #DrFauci is dictating to @POTUS when our economy will reopen. One person alone should NEVER dictate the fate of #Americans . Our rights are being violated bc of #COVID19 politics. #ReopenAmericaNow
AGAINST	if I visited Tescos bearing in mind its inside ,no social distancing ,no masks,no record of visitors  then got home and tested postive for #COVID19 rang them to inform them would they have to shut the store ??   another crazy set of double standards, list goes on
FAVOR	All the educated people are supporting #OnlineEducation under these circumstances. The ones who are opposing it only shows how illiterate they are. Not their fault, they didn’t get good schools. And the same will happen if kids today don’t get quality education.

NONE	@AnthonySabatini This man must have some deep dirt on somebody to still have a job.
AGAINST	When will some one ask Dr. Fauci how his vaccination and/or cure for the common cold, a coronavirus, is coming along? How about his vaccine for AIDS? Even the flu vaccine is only between 45-60% effective. These opening up criteria set forth are ridiculous.
FAVOR	You are the only person I trust when it comes to the information about the coronavirus. You are well respected, &amp; we all appreciate your work in the field to help save lives &amp; make this world a better &amp; safer place.
AGAINST	The policymakers need to consider the fact that schools can't run without fees and teachers can't survive without salary.
FAVOR	Remember to wash your hands, wear a face mask and keep social distance. COVID19 is real.
FAVOR	People will surprise you. They want schools to be shut, the power is in your hands, don't send your kids to school, why do we want to be told that schools are shut before doing so. if everyone doesn't send their kids to school there wont be a school.
NONE	@IngrahamAngle Bc that's what is required because #IMPOTUS failed to protect the people from #COVID19 in the first place and allowed the Country to burn. Remember, if you vote for TrumpPutin, you are voting against #AmericaOrTrump  and for #lockingaway of these criminals.
AGAINST	@no_phux All the Essential workers have been keeping things going since the lockdown, Teachers: Time to do your part and get the kids back in school with no conditions, kids do not die from COVID, Wear a mask if you choose to, otherwise get back to work and teach the kids!
NONE	@thomaskaine5 The rich are buying the stocks because they are cheep. They just want to own MORE, MORE, MORE. They want to own every last piece of the pie. Screw the little guys, we can die in the streets. As long as we make the food and nanny their kids.#trumpkillsus #TrumpVirus

FAVOR	@thekenshain @TheJLV Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"
FAVOR	@FoxNews Protecting the vulnerable is a big part of the plumeting of death rates.
FAVOR	At least this Tweet Storm establishes one thing as a country of parents, teachers we are united that we want our children to learn and have governments not dictating the terms. We trust the schools that we have picked for our children and want them to guide us
AGAINST	as the Furlough scheme starts to change and reality of this mess start to hit home   people starting to think    did as I was told and stayed in   spent all my savings  now I have lost my job / home    and I dont even know anyone who had this killer plague  :thinking_face:

FAVOR	You must close the schools for a period of time corona virus infected many people, do it now u don’t want to be like Italy

NONE	@Cassie61106759 @autumnmoon724 @LikeRepublican @johncardillo I feel for your business and your state of mind as I'm sure this is taking your stress levels beyond belief... I have never worn a mask and hope this will be over soon..
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump believes a washed up former TV game show host from the 80s over medical experts, doctors, and even his own Coronavirus task force experts. Let that sink in.
FAVOR	I know I have like zero followers, but I had to quit my teaching job today because so many #COVIDIOTS think it’s a hoax and my school is going full steam ahead and opening face to face with NO face masks. I’m devastated. I loved my job.
NONE	@JustMEtillDeath @Francis_Joseph Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought
AGAINST	@kylegriffin1 A realist knows that dying from this virus, if healthy, is less than .0065%. An alarmist demands we mask up and creates divide and promote scare tactics...oh...and throws out the first pitch at the Nationals game. #FireFauci

NONE	@drdavidsamadi Hmm. Why should I wear a mask, HCQ cures the China virus.

AGAINST	If we keep waiting for schools to reopen, which doesn’t seem possible in the near future, the  psychological connect and deep-rooted bonding that the children have developed with their teachers and their school will soon be lost.

FAVOR	Oh, it’s going to be “a safe reopening of the schools.”   We can all stop worrying. Donald Trump says it will be safe, so it will be safe because he says so. When has he ever been wrong before?  What is his strategy? That it will be safe. Simple.    #TrumpsAmerica

AGAINST	@GovNedLamont Or maybe we just reached herd immunity? Follow the data, believe the science. Look at all the kids playing basketball and soccer.
FAVOR	So @realDonaldTrump and @vp have decided to wind down  the coronavirus task force.  Makes sense.  The press conferences have been a disaster as Trump hijacked them, and he can't control #DrFauci , he can control the head of @HHSGov.  Trump doesn't want accurate info out there.

FAVOR	When my 5 yr old nephew sees a mask in our hands he asks if we're going somewhere, he reminds his big brothers to bring a mask when they leave the house. He's adapted. He was excited to start school this year, but I'd rather homeschool all of them than send them in.

AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump That is not what they said. And you know that. They want schools to open safely ONLY if the spread of COVID-19 in an area is under CONTROL. But given the GOP and this administration’s completely botched response in handling this pandemic, that will NOT be possible.

AGAINST	@mamabird_31 @JordanSchachtel @ThorOdinson543 YES &amp; More testing equals more cases. Most new cases have little or no symptoms.   Number of cases is a joke.   The only measure that matters is number of deaths.   New data from the CDC states the Survival rate is now 99.7%
NONE	Amazing how journalistically dishonest @TheJuanWilliams blaming Trump for #coronavirus accusations of slow response! You are so dishonest Juan! Pathetically! Complete bullshit!
NONE	Do you remember along time ago, back when dinosaurs still existed. Don't need a mask it's unnecessary and ineffective. Today companys are making face shields for us to wear. As long as it's just 2 more weeks it's okay.
FAVOR	@RandPaul your smug partisanship during this hearing is just deplorable. Your attempt at attacking #DrFauci is disgusting &amp; to talk about being humble before doing so, just shines an LED light on your hypocrisy for everyone at home watching to see. #COVID19

AGAINST	@PauleyTeeks Which start? In Jan Fauci said covid posed very little risk to US. Feb 26  calls travel restrictions "irrelevant". In March mocks usage of masks on 60 minutes saying they don't do anything.
AGAINST	@4YrsToday Correctly identifying an elephant doesn’t make him a coronavirus expert.
NONE	@Jan15197307 It goes deeper  Compromising one’s Immune system is What Gates is after  Dig deeper Compromising a child’s natural immune system To fight - Masks are suppressing  Herd  Immunity   Making society more vulnerable and in need Of a vaccine  IS what the NWO is after
FAVOR	@mmurraypolitics @MTPFirstRead He had help.@FoxNews.@whca &amp; the way the MSM started covering the #COVID19 as debatable as.@realDonaldTrump was spewing Gibberish, known &amp; provable lies...as #DrFauci was marginalized &amp; #drbirx was elevated as she Jigoestically &amp; willfully manipulated Scientific Coronavirus data

FAVOR	@MaryRedden1 Even some of the suburban schools have issues with cleaning supplies and ask parents to provide them at the beginning of the year. With most people unemployed this is untenable.  #keepsafe  #schools
NONE	I'm watching the #Senate committee questioning #DrFauci and other members of the #CoronavirusTaskForce, and its kind of interesting, in its own way. I like seeing them testify face to face, but the #SocialDistancing adds a little more flavor to the proceedings.

AGAINST	@murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump There is no substitute for human interaction, @murray_nyc    Virtual learning certainly has some benefits, but students are not getting certain things from virtual learning. Combine that with social isolation and the impact that has on kids.

NONE	2020 has been about shedding the negatives till now. All that was not working has gone. Clean your soul. Clean your heart. Purify yourself with positive thoughts.
FAVOR	It’s sad to be sure but #DrFauci and his excellent explanation of the progression of the #COVID19 infection numbers and impacts, with lag times and “conversion rates” between stages, is the best gut level analog of the #marketing funnel from real world experience.
AGAINST	@michellemalkin @realDonaldTrump Right! Why does this guy get so much air time... @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr need to set that guy aside post haste! #FauciTheFraud
AGAINST	Big thanks to @10DowningStreet   My daughter was subject to an over-reactive mother today who saw it fit to drag her daughter away from mine because she didn’t have a mask on. She’s 9. Hope you’re proud of what you’re doing to society. I hope you all b*** in hell!

NONE	Across India, a whole spectrum of parents and the government have taken to systematic outrage and criticising of school's charging fees in the lockdown period. They say the phones, laptops and broadband charges are expensive and unnecessary.
AGAINST	My mother is from Europe, moved here 40 years ago. Sterilization wasn't known to her, which is why her immune system is better than the average US citizen's. I see this from many people around me as well. Dr. Anthony Fauci is a liar and a fraud.  #coronavirus #COVID19 #DrFauci

AGAINST	So everyone is making it mandatory to wear masks but business have to stay closed or have very limited occupancy... that is going to help the economy!
FAVOR	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this.
FAVOR	@OregonGovBrown Good! Cases are spiking and it's essential that action is taken to stop the spread.
FAVOR	@dawn_comfort @LukeMessac @ScottGottliebMD He never said he lied about masks. He said he didn’t want everyone to rush out and buy up the masks that the frontline workers needed. Wear a darn mask and leave Dr Fauci alone! Please and thank you.
AGAINST	Guess who's going to be hurt the most by keeping schools closed? Ding... ding... ding.... all they want to do is keep the divide and keep the classes separated.

FAVOR	@debragarrett @realDonaldTrump If you think #DrFauci is “deep state,” you’re an idiot. You’re probably one of the a-holes applauding his death threats.  Please tweet from your hospital bed, when need a ventilator but can’t get one, because you’re in a “beautiful red state” that you think is immune to #COVID19.
NONE	Why only private teachers are always targets by the people who are not sending their children to a good school and always opposing the functions of good schools. Government teachers are receiving their full salary in account in every month with doing nothing.
FAVOR	@News24 Mmmm It's SO difficult, who does one believe? #Trump, a politician &amp; #Covid19 denialist, who get his 'facts' from #SocialMedia or #DrFauci, one of the #USA's top immunologist, whose facts are based in science? Such a conundrum!

NONE	School is a community where we enlighten innocent minds &amp; prepare them for the future challenges. But Present Policies &amp;  Political involvement has completely ruined the educational structure of our schools,colleges &amp; private institutions.
NONE	@CNNPolitics I’d like to see Faux News admit they made an error and advise getting on board with wearing masks. Hannity and others took an early victory lap on states reopening briskly without proper safeguards. The data suggests otherwise. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
AGAINST	@AngelaTeague12 @KTULNews Considering the younger population is much less impacted by the virus, there really isn’t a reason to keep schools closed. Plus, a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics encourages “having students physically present in school.”
FAVOR	My nephew came back from school with news of an alleged positive case of his physical sciences teacher, who also lost his wife to covid.  The school is continuing as usual, keeping things :zipper__mouth_face:  Why weren't teachers &amp; students tested upon returning to schools?

FAVOR	@thehill We aren’t in the clear. This will not “magically disappear.” Science is our arsenal, Fauci is our Patton.  The premature drive for normalcy-to send children to school-will be an historic, irresponsible strategy. Not until there is a vaccine are we safe.

AGAINST	@TexasTribune Even if it's ridiculous &amp; unnecessary? Even if it causes our students to fall behind, be at greater risk for child abuse, &amp; causes parents to lose their livelyhoods because they are unable to work? Closing schools is disgraceful &amp; history will not treat you kindly.

FAVOR	@realTiffyCat @scdhec I pray that SCDHEC stays transparent. I heard today that our incompetent governor is directing SCDHEC to change the way they report their numbers. to not give people enough information, so McMaster can do Trump’s bidding in opening our schools without restrictions.
NONE	@thehill @mcspocky Americans who lost their lives, due to Trump's maladministration of #covid19, over 134,000.  This did not need to happen, America is one of the richest countries in the world, BUT we have an Inept POTUS, and his entire administration grossly neglecting U.S.

FAVOR	@B52Malmet Our schools are offering either online only or 2 days in person supplemented with online. We chose online only for our HS Junior.  Just got word that the Univ. our college student attends will be online only.
FAVOR	2020: the year the president urged us to sacrifice children and teachers so that he can hopefully prop up the stock market by a few points thereby slightly increasing his chances of keeping a job he hates.  #SchoolReopening #schoolsreopening

FAVOR	@SaysHummingbird I hear I can’t breathe in a mask a lot. Boo hoo I’m sure a ventilator will be more comfortable. #COVID19 #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
AGAINST	@markknoller @CNN Good. We’re done with #Fauxi. Wrong on all counts. Don’t need him.
NONE	#DrFauci said #covid19 is "10 times more lethal than the seasonal #flu." The seasonal flu kills 250-650,000 people in the US, alone, every year. That means, if we don't get control of this, we could expect 2.5 to 6.5 Million people could die from #Coronavirus in the US, alone.
AGAINST	Teachers have been preparing and up skilling themsleves to connect with their learners . Preparedness to face the situation is the key to education and that’s what schools do #SaveOurSchools @CMOGuj

FAVOR	I will always trust Fauci and will never trust @realDonaldTrump. tRump is a mob boss and the biggest liar ever. I'd be surprised if Fauci ever purposely and knowingly lied. In this country it's not the #ChinaVirus it's the #TrumpVirus.
NONE	@kurteichenwald @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump @SenRickScott @marcorubio @GOP pass Care Act, fund schools and individuals. STOP playing your greedy political games with people's lives!!!!
NONE	Can anyone imagine a society without good school and good schools without excellent educators
FAVOR	@donwinslow @PressSec We ALL want schools to open, but we want it done when it’s safe. It isn’t safe now.
AGAINST	So where was this #DrFauci faggot in January &amp; February. I knew about the outbreak and it’s potential on January 6th. Where was Fauci? Why was he silent? You’re telling me this man was unaware of Coronavirus until recently? Ok then he’s not credible &amp; should stfu
NONE	@iam_johnw What’s with you’all never learning the lesson of jumping to conclusions. The dog pile thing is really ugly. You might want to work on that. This is just the beginning of folks losing it. We best have some empathy for the tragic back story we know nothing about :woman_facepalming_selector:

AGAINST	Thank you for flip flopping on the mask issue, helping cdc and who to spread their fear porn, and for playing a role in dismantling the American middle class.
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn getting nervous?  You'd better do your job and acknowledge that children die of COVID-19 and that this administration is the most corrupt in at least a century
AGAINST	Since when is a virus with a 99.7% survival rate a pandemic? Since 2020? Since Democrats figured out they have not one viable candidate to offer America? Since the Swamp started to drain? Since the NWO cabal was exposed by @realDonaldTrump?

AGAINST	@MarketWatch Please, find this guy a nice retirement home somewhere (not in New York, I’m not vindictive). His advice has been inconsistent and often terrible.
NONE	“The virus doesn’t read talking points,” @DrTomFrieden said. “The #virus doesn’t watch news shows. The virus just waits for us to make mistakes. And when we make mistakes, as TX, FL, SC, &amp; AZ did, the virus wins. When we ignore science, the virus wins.” #COVID19
FAVOR	@GovAndyBeshear Would you rather have loss of JOBS or loss of LIVES on your conscious? Especially with opening schools where most kids are attending. COVID cases are going to spread more rapidly than ever. Why take the “let’s wait and see approach?”
AGAINST	Since when does the government think homeschooling is the "thing to do"? I remember when they tried outlawing it!
FAVOR	Where is #DrFauci? #pressbriefing #COVID19 #WearAMask

NONE	If the US would’ve had a nationwide lockdown to begin with by now we would’ve gone back to our lives and we wouldn’t have to be worrying about whether kids should go back to school or not.
FAVOR	@MichaelArt123 I prefer people representing our country that believe in science.  If you’re not wearing a mask, you don’t believe in science.   I suppose stopping at a red light, wearing a seatbelt,  and wearing clothes in public is stifling your liberties too.
NONE	Torn between using scamdemic or election infection....
FAVOR	Our future is in the hands of our children, is not like am saying this because I left school with grade 7 but schools must be closed.
NONE	The moment I saw the press conference live streaming to reopen schools I was thinking
NONE	@GovMLG Lead in what capacity? The majority of your state is on welfare. Your education system is ranked #49. You have done NOTHING to change any of this. You put more New Mexicans out of work each week with your arbitrary decrees. #stopthemadness #openNewMexico

AGAINST	Nobody told the weasel about the briefing. Now he will run and cry to CNN about it.
AGAINST	@MattHancock This isn't rocket science Mr Cock. If less people have died than have for this time of year for the last five years then your virus BS has gone firmly out the window.
NONE	@realDonaldTrump I love you, I'm 60 years old and I know you are the greatest President of my lifetime. I thank God for you. :pray::pray:That being said, I cannot watch the #ChrisWallace interview because he makes me sick. I support you 100% #Trump2020 for the :earth_americas: #NoMask
FAVOR	@sanket True that! In fact the Virus is in its much stronger avatar and it probably has learnt to adapt to the weather. This one is more dangerous than the original version. We need more preparedness and more precautions.  #CoronaVirus
FAVOR	@duty2warn The GOP is the Party of Grim Reapers. Florida reported 15,300 new cases of #Covid_19 today. GOP and Betsy DeVos wants kids in school to triple the numbers. The right constantly lies about COVID-19 but are now smearing #DrFauci to cover up their lies. #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
AGAINST	@DanCrenshawTX Schools need to reopen. The science shows children who do contract Covid do not become ill like adults and they do not pass it.
AGAINST	It’s been four months, my kids have played with their neighborhood friends almost every day- none of us have COVID. Tell me why we can’t open up schools WITHOUT masks and social distancing?

FAVOR	@MollyJongFast Children are not allowed in school if they have a contagious disease.  Letters are sent home informing parents. Just in case. Asymptomatic covid Could quickly infect the entire school. Then the community. It is foolish to contemplate opening until testing is in place.
NONE	Most are invested in thinking about continued learning for children. But for that to happen, schools must be able to collect what it rightfully due to them and pay their teachers and help them continue skilling up. They need as teachers to continue
FAVOR	@GOP We are fine with opening schools with a PLAN, mandatory masks, contact tracing, onsite testing with same day results, required social distancing. PPE for teachers, staff, janitors, etc. It requires MONEY and the do-nothing GOP will provide none of that.
NONE	@flintcams Thank you. Xx

AGAINST	FIVE Democrat Governors are destroying the Airline Industry!  Draconian restrictions on air travel between 25 states are causing thousands of layoffs.  OPEN AMERICA NOW! @TheJusticeDept  @realDonaldTrump  @DonaldJTrumpJr  @FAANews  @GovMurphy
FAVOR	Why wait till someone on campus has the coronavirus then close it? That will just help the disease spread more.
