FAVOR	@DWUhlfelderLaw @Surgeon_General And evidently today according to our "leader", there is a decline. Lies, lies, lies. No testing over weekend so of course the numbers are down. I don't need a math degree to figure that out. But #DeathSantis got pat on back for job well done

FAVOR	It's you vs. the virus. The ONLY way to win is to stop it from spreading by depriving it of future hosts. That means staying the fuck home and wearing a damn mask if you MUST leave the house.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump Please help with THE PUBLIC MASK TYRANNY!!!! We defend you day n and day out! Please I’m begging you, help!!!!!

FAVOR	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO.
FAVOR	Is there still a pandemic or not? Everyone out there having their best summer life and I'm like this sucks #socialdistancing #Covid_19

AGAINST	@Hank_licious @realjuliasong @BMcAdory9 I've been saying that all along. If the masks work then let those that want to wear them wear them and those of us who want to be free not wear. It's a free country. Or at least it was.
AGAINST	@JohmBoFlavin @Cernovich They can't force you to wear a mask.

AGAINST	People listen. Let’s talk a little truth here. Do an experiment. Put on your mask and walk into a room with a scent, candles, freshener, perfume. Covid virus is smaller than that. If you can smell a scent the virus has no problem getting in.

AGAINST	@DVATW I went to Debenhams last Friday, mid afternoon. I realise they’re having problems at the moment, but in a huge shop, I counted 6 customers. Other shops are the same, numbers way down. The compulsory wearing of masks (for nothing) is killing the high street.

AGAINST	Mark my words- FL, AZ, TX are through the worst.  But it's not bc of masks.  It's bc it's been about 4-5 wks.  That's the cycle.  Just like it was in NY.
AGAINST	@10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @CMO_England This is idiotic. There are barely any hospital admissions let alone deaths &amp; no scientific evidence to support wearing masks. #PHE death stats were ‘misleading’ so end this madness. Give us back our freedom. #EndLockdown

NONE	@p25735 @ScottAdamsSays The experts and media portrayed Sars-cov-2 as a supernatural virus which you couldn't create immunity to, you could get a second time, would never go away (as all corona viruses do), etc. Temp check is what is done when I go for facial. Makes tons of sense.

AGAINST	Grocery shopping with husband at Kroger today for a couple of items for dinner. No masks. Yelled at by woman 10 ft away at register and when asked my manager if I needed a mask “no thank you I don’t need one”.

FAVOR	@EricEganTV @WKRN Good for them! So tired of reading constant stories of those who refuse to abide by mask mandates. Equally tired of abuse workers are facing to try to enforce them.

FAVOR	@julieasmyle @ChimerReilly @GovWhitmer They all had masks on. I don't like they weren't distanced, but every single one wore masks, unlike the ignorant a**es who whine because they are asked to think of others.  Make me.  Haha. #RIPJohnLewis #HeWasLoved

FAVOR	3. In many countries these are being handed free out at metros, supermarkets, town halls and doctor's surgeries. Home made ones don't usually clip over the nose so are pretty useless. Why is England so arrogant that it won't learn from other countries? 
FAVOR	We have thick smoke from CA fires hanging over the city today. So, I wore a mask on my hour long bike ride. My avg. HR was 144 (max 170). I have asthma. I can do an endurance workout with asthma while wearing a mask. Quit complaining and

FAVOR	Not wearing a mask has replaced confederate flag shirts as the ultimate indicator of white trash.
FAVOR	I'm not condoning violence, but why are all the stories about people catching a beating over masks about people who actually comply? You would think the non-mask wearers would be the ones on the run.:thinking_face: #MaskItOrCasket

NONE	New title Maskhole. I think I'm going to use this very soon. #coronavirus
FAVOR	Wearing a mask and social distancing doesn't mean you are "living in fear." It's like wearing a seat belt or using your headlights in the rain, it's for your safety and the safety of others.
FAVOR	@GrumpHatesTrump To all anti-maskers and covidiots, especially that idiot in the WH, and all the politicians. This will all be the cause of your downfall. Karma is coming soon!

AGAINST	@javadisciple @supitsshekinah This is why I don’t wear it. If I was told “we aren’t sure about the total effectiveness, but it will cut down on spread, and we are asking you to make a sacrifice and wear a mask” I’d be all for it. But no one is leveling with others like free adults so
AGAINST	So if we’re all wearing masks and cases continue to rise what does that tell us #MasksSaveLives
AGAINST	@2ndfor1st That is what most elders look like in their n-95 masks. Turns out, if you are older &amp; have breathing issues anyway, including physical restrictions like weight, it can make the mask deadly. If he leaves it on longer he could die. #oxygen
FAVOR	Y’all, wearing a mask is great. I can mouth the words to the weird song I have in my head and no one looks at me funny.
AGAINST	@RealBasedMAGA do you really believe "brown dog" is an oncologist ?  thats a typical agitator account.    anyway, please make sure the governor of Texas gets your message about the phony covid test results. this is going on everywhere. they have to keep the hoax going.
FAVOR	It shouldn't be a news headline that Trump has a mask on during a pandemic. It should have been a bigger headline when he had rallies and meetings without a.mask. #coronavirus 
FAVOR	@Mystere07623203 @va_shiva @Liberty13046 130,000 families know who had it. Another 100,000+ are hospitalized. I suppose you think they're all actors paid for by Soros and the Clinton foundation. 
AGAINST	@GovWhitmer, @gretchenwhitmer is expected to stricken her #Mask laws today, hilariously enough, this is what we need. She will keep digging herself deeper, when if she was in the real talks of Michigan, and not in her high tower of exemption. #maskoff

FAVOR	All well and good to have a ‘no mask, no ride’ TV advert @Uber but there’s no protection for your drivers if they need to enforce it against selfish people..plus the issue of simply not getting paid. Customers think beyond yourself and
FAVOR	@kenyadad12 The people who refuse to wear a mask (aka Cult 45) are truly ignorant and selfish. It’s not even debatable because it’s insanely simple, yet these folks think their “rights” are more important than anyone else’s. Classic trump mentality.
AGAINST	@Ilhan Hmm nah. Never will. Nobody likes you and you married your brother. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin #DemocratsRuinEverything #DemocratsAreCorrupt #masksdontwork
NONE	@JoyAnnReid @Cubfan13241 Don’t blame the governor, it is 45’s lack of leadership that has lead to these problems. Deaths didn’t start going crazy until businesses started opening up early, under pressure of federal government.  #TrumpsDeathToll157K #TrumpLiesPeopleDie  #extendthe600
FAVOR	@KAG45Patriot #facemasks are mostly effective when wore by the sick people. As it is difficult to know who is sick and who is not, if mass people #WearAMask in public places it can significantly reduce the spread of the virus.
FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd Yes... exactly... "harass cake eaters and bakeries" if that's your bliss. Really! But please do it without shouting. Follow the law, follow local regs, respect store policies, and puleeezzz wear a mask. :grin:

FAVOR	@SuzanneEvans1 1. Get Covid-19  2. Get intubated and ventilated. 3. Tweet to tell how much better it is than wearing a mask.  Haven't seen one of those tweets yet? You're not going to. Shut up and wear the damn mask. 
FAVOR	@WCheesemaker @StephenKing No. You’re missing the point. And from the way I phrased my statement I can understand why. I was attempting to point out masks work! They help stop the spread of disease. I should have stated it more clearly. I’m a scientist &amp; a big fan of masks- and science!! :relaxed:

FAVOR	@TheJordanRachel Your running won’t affect my weight. Your mask wearing will affect my health. If you haven’t figured that out, you’re an idiot. If you have figured it out, you’re incredibly selfish. I run to protect my health. I wear a mask to protect others. Get over yourself.
AGAINST	I want to thank the medical community for JUST NOW realizing, after hundreds of years of science regarding respiratory illnesses, that Amazon masks work. MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH! Let’s cure cancer next! #COVIDIOTS 
FAVOR	At this point I will happily take a couple of months of martial law just so that at the end of it I can get back to my fucking life! WEAR YOUR MASK PEOPLE AND PUT IT OVER YOUR GOD DAMN NOSE! I hate this fucking city #Nashville #COVIDIOT #coronavirus
FAVOR	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV &amp; only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin.
FAVOR	@AuthenticVegas @CityOfLasVegas @iheartmindy @realDonaldTrump I have cancer, I do not go out except for blood tests and chemo.  There are people in line at Quest with no mask, even though their sign says "no entry without a mask".  I would like to go out, shop, eat in a restaurant, but I am terrified.

NONE	This is how every county should be testing in Texas yet .@GovAbbott is buying into bad data and testing reports and taking orders from Fauci whose proven to be unreliable and a fraud.
FAVOR	Refusing to wear a mask radiates small dick energy.
AGAINST	@Charbrevolution Me too. The gov are going for the social shaming tactic ‘ your mask protects me and my mask protects you’. Same nonsence as with vaccines.
AGAINST	The mask can only help for so long!  After you fiddle with it for 30 seconds, it’s pretty much ineffective. So just stay away from me! :grinning:
FAVOR	@NPR Is that Tucker Carlson?  #COVIDIOTS
AGAINST	@ICMdoc @lyndsay_hopkins @ShippersUnbound Yeah.... Actually no, the guidance has been a joke &amp; the why has been for corporate money making.

AGAINST	LI’m no longer going to put up w this crap with the masks at PATH MEDICAL. I had a mask on, certified by the CDC!!! And they told me I need one of the ‘other ones’. Now we’re dictating which masks you can wear? These people are sick!

FAVOR	141 days into the US #COVID19 pandemic. With all the information we have about the benefit of wearing #masks, if you aren’t, you are responsible for the continued spread, deaths, illness, closures, financial ruin, and ongoing horror!
NONE	@gordongekko369 @Molly_NYC @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump No it doesn’t. A case means positive individual. The number of tests is tracked separately. Positives aren’t higher because of testing, but because more people are sick, super genius. Ffs, you can’t be this daft.
FAVOR	So many people on Twitter saying they won’t be wearing a mask. They need to stop being so dramatic and get on with it. I would rather not have another harsh lockdown in the winter. #WearAMask #WearADamnMask

AGAINST	Small local grocery store did not have sign requiring mask per state mandate and was pretty busy. Only about half of customers wearing masks. The dairy section looked almost empty. Love it and they will continue to get my business.

FAVOR	@Jerry_Kersey @JadeIsMad @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump You contracted it with the mask on, because other people aren’t wearing one. Your mask protects them from you. Masks only work if EVERYONE wears one!
AGAINST	@ConHome @MattHancock Just stop this. Release new death stats ‘from’ COVID-19 to correct the ‘misleading’ #PHE figures. Barely any hospital admissions/deaths. NHS has spare capacity. No evidence to support mask wearing.  This virus is of no danger to vast majority of people #EndLockdown
FAVOR	@bossmanomega22 @DeAnna4Congress Exactly a humanity issue! Thanks for recognizing that people need to put on mask to protect one another. This virus affects everybody differently.

AGAINST	@fliss1977 @dockaurG The idea is to create a new generation of even more ignorant people. Easier to control and manipulate by the fewer. I can't believe how easy is to brainwash people. Schools need to reopen normally!
FAVOR	Went to the gas station yesterday and I was the only one wearing a mask. Did I cough as I put my beer on the counter? Yes. But I resisted the urge to say “Is the kitchen closed tonight? It usually smells like cooking food in here.” So not a complete bitch right?
AGAINST	I just casually walked into Dunkin Donuts, went to the counter, placed and paid for my order and exited. All without a mask.  No one said a thing, even though they all had masks. We have to start living like normal human beings.
AGAINST	@AP He's been wearing a mask for several weeks and it still didn't keep him from getting it. Masks don't work. Plus, he feels fine but still has to self quarantine. WTF?
FAVOR	Yesterday the #LAPD gave out 300 masks in Hollywood. I am embarrassed to live in this City, a place where infections, hospitalizations &amp; deaths continue to rise &amp; 300 people felt that it was ok to leave home without a masks. It’s the City of idiots not ANGELES.
FAVOR	And all of this is over not wearing a damn mask to buy 2 cigars?!?! Yes this pandemic is tough for all of us, and it sucks when a parent loses custody of their child, but that’s not how you handle it. There are odd, tough jobs you can still get hired on even today.
FAVOR	@kaitlancollins @mkraju Hardly anyone wearing masks. Another bad message.
AGAINST	Just popped to a couple of local shops so showed them the respect of wearing a muzzle for the first time.  It was really horrible and didn’t take long before I was feeling short of breath. How have you lot been putting up with this? #masks

NONE	@simondolan These mindless morons have heaved themselves off their sofas to come out and threaten the rest of us.  According to @PHE_uk obesity makes the coronavirus more deadly.

FAVOR	@MrCannon_19 You have captured my high school students perfectly. What would elementary students look like? #WearAMask

FAVOR	@ABC So nobody wears a mask in South Carolina???
AGAINST	@CoreyBr54230981 @Surgeon_General You believe that?  It’s an arbitrary number.  No one goes into a store and stands in place.  More than 99% of your breath escapes the mask unfiltered.  2 ft or 20 ft matters not.
FAVOR	@MeaningsOfNames @DrLesterColl @Delta They were headed to the non mask wearing state of GA.  Their loser @GovKemp would surely be disappointed if they wore one. #shameonyou #GovKemp
FAVOR	Made my first shop visit today in months (wearing mask). Literally no one else is wearing one.
NONE	I miss concerts.  Watching @RealMeatLoaf 2011 show from GUILTY PLEASURES tour final show at Sydney Entertainment Center.  But no live concerts is worth it to  #StopTheSpread of #COVID19
FAVOR	@BreesAnna @JamesCranworth Our ancestors fought against people being gassed you complete sausage. A mask in a shop for 20 minutes is first world selfish mother fucking problems.
NONE	Y’all remember how stressful @jjabrams #LOST was?    It’s like a lovely vacation / get away from all we’re going through.  Ain’t nothing like a pandemic to make the black smoke monster look like a bbq back draft.    #perspective 
AGAINST	@jwildeboer @ShineALittleLo1 @bitcoinnovice @nadinebh_ No you don't!! And there is no evidence that muzzles or lockdowns have saved a life. But there's masses of evidence of lives lost due to lockdown (suicides) and cancelled life saving treatments. Enjoy your day

AGAINST	Hottest Day in the #UK Take your Masks off! Breathe! Get plenty of Vitamin D! :muscle::sun_with_face:

FAVOR	I put a face mask over the air intake of my car to be safe and my car broke down. Who knew that limiting the air intake is bad for your car. It’s ok for the human body though isn’t it uncle @DanielAndrewsMP ? #resignDanielAndrews #endthelockdown

FAVOR	@Politidope @1zzyzyx1 BOYCOTT 7-11!  Front Royal is known for non mask wearers. They have a demo derby, tractor pull etc coming up and I know the stands will be filled with peeps not wearing masks. The worst thing is 10 days later those kids go back to school.  #notuntilwearesafe

FAVOR	Not sure why there’s so much pant pissing about having to wear a face covering for a short amount of time. Judging by a lot of the folk moaning about it, a face covering is doing them a favour!  #masks  
AGAINST	A lot of kids will never have the memories of going to summer camp. Instead they’ll have memories of going to Walmart wearing a mask. Oh well...:man_shrugging_selector:
FAVOR	Hey so, something weird happened when I went to get my mums medication, some guy honked his car horn at me and gave me a thumbs up, was it because I was wearing a mask? #Covid_19

AGAINST	@GovMikeHuckabee @OutnumberedFNC @FoxNews Why don’t you retract mandates for children!!!  To wear Suficating Masks!!!!   There is know Scientific proof why schools shoul be closed. Kids have a better chance of catching and dying from influenza.  Better shut down schools during flu season!

AGAINST	@naijagyaldee This is what people are allowing to happen because they blindly do what the corrupt Govt. tells them, without question. This week it is masks, next it will be something else unless somehow the sane, intelligent people take back control of our country and our lives.
FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why is there no plan to stop or at least slow the spread? Mask mandates, close down to phase one in hot areas, something? Testing is great, but it doesn't slow the spread.

NONE	@NSWHealth @GladysB Masks yet?? Or are we just going to wait and become Victoria???
AGAINST	@profman60 @EndUKLockdown1 @ChrissieGrech @sainsburys @Tesco If masks worked we wouldn't have needed Lockdown....! Masks spread more disease because people touch them all the time, moving them up and down and then they touch things, gross! Wash your hands before touching mouth and eyes is the sensible advice!
FAVOR	@MaureenKTVU @KTVU Is there anyway to fine the @realDonaldTrump for not wearing his mask ever, or just the tax payers. #heshouldsentstandards #ohwaithedoesntlistentothedoctorsmybad
FAVOR	In March our amazing backyard neighbor died from COVID-19. Today I’m watching people (thankfully wearing masks) go through all his stuff as part of an estate sale. It’s all so sad. If we had shut down earlier, he would likely still be here.
FAVOR	Every non-masker should have to go to the bedside of someone in their community dying of Covid-19 and explain to them why they think it’s ok to not wear masks. #WearAMask #WearMasks #WearAMaskSaveALife

FAVOR	LOTS of masks in the mall today. YAY!! @CornwallCentre @RealTenille
AGAINST	Masks are as well hiding our facial features which otherwise make us recognizable. By making compulsory to wear them along with the social distancing, are they trying to dehumanise and disconnect us? #MaskeyeHayır #NoToMasks

AGAINST	@garethicke What MONTHS after the main event! Why were we not wearing face nappies in March-June. Cause we did not need them then and we certainly do not need them now. It is all to keep the FEAR going. Keeping it fresh in our minds, making it easier to give us a toxic vaccine. ffs

FAVOR	@Patzfan5112 @WADeptHealth @GovInslee Many people, including a massive number of idiots in Yakima County did not (and many still don’t) wear masks when advised and then mandated. Many others are only doing it halfway...as in not covering nose and mouth. Bottom line:
AGAINST	@DonFitzgerald1 @fmcoreega @MsResJudicata No. The fiber of the mask has holes that are larger than the virus being carried &amp; do not protect you or others.  The N95 fails to prevent sending virus out or receiving it in.  The mask is an agenda, fear based experiment to find out how quickly people turn to #sheep 
AGAINST	@A_McDonald68 Can you overcome the evil playbook of dems and prevent voter fraud?  We need you for 4 more! Also PLEASE sign an EO banning mandatory masks! We are tired of fighting this every time we go in public.  #TrumpVlog 
NONE	@GavinNewsom Be Smart Gavin! #Hydroxychloroquine Works! CA is going BROKE. Your STATS mean Nothing:see_no_evil:. Exaggerated Inflated Manipulated. Are those deaths from Other Diseases? Are those positives ASymptomatic? OPEN UP CA before it is Decimated by Homelessness Joblessness Depression

AGAINST	@Surgeon_General @RPIAthletics Please cite one study that shows masks are more than 1% effective at filtering aerosolized virus.  And don’t cite the ones only looking at unidirectional forward expression.  They admit almost all breath comes out the sides, top, and bottom.
AGAINST	I really think that not wearing a mask empowers others to do the same.   I think it is particular to time of day/place too. On eve  train tonight, far fewer people had them on &amp;  I was in a poorer area too. Has anyone else noticed any trends with mask compliance? #kbf

AGAINST	Mother Nature along with good hygiene is slowing the covid virus, not masks
FAVOR	I don't get why there r folks so against #Masks? China manage to eliminate #COVID19 bc of its strict on masks and isolation. Continue mask-free and going out when issued with stay home notices. And your city/state can nvr end #COVID 1/2 #MasksDontWork

AGAINST	@mycael101 @catturd2 @jaketapper Exactly. And I've not worn a mask at all, been in huge crowds without masks, been at a house party close quarters with someone who 2 days later tested positive and I still haven't caught it.  So the mask debate rages on...

FAVOR	@drsimonegold Instead of going on every right wing talk show and pushing dangerous ineffective compounds like some travelling quack, tell the truth.   The best way to deal with Covid-19 isn’t a drug.  It’s not contracting it in the first place.
FAVOR	Don't give in to the government attempt to control you!   Stop covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough!   Protect your freedom!  The government are controlling us. Where's the evidence NOT sneezing and coughing on people ACTUALLY saves lives.  #WearAMask

FAVOR	@sapiofoxy ‘Clowns’ trying to help prevent spread of a serious infection, and if ur seeing them they’ll be protecting u. Hardly something to ridicule people for. We need look after each other and masks are one part of this
AGAINST	@BBCNewsNI Number one priority is your own health not others. If you have a health condition and you think wearing a mask will protect you then it's YOUR responsibility to protect yourself not others! Healthy people should not be wearing any sort of mask!
FAVOR	@djrothkopf Bars, restaurants, sports, premature reopening, antimasking, and quarantine fatigue are all what make the US #1.  I'm still in disbelief that these public health measures are debated.
AGAINST	@PJB174 No masks because they know they are useless for spread of virus!  The only purpose is to spread fear!  #DoNotComply
FAVOR	@alexronald123 @BorisJohnson that's nonsense:  masks reduce the distance water droplets from your mouth spread, thereby lowering the likelihood of the virus spreading (the virus travels in water droplets) stop your whining, stop spreading misinformation and
FAVOR	@SamCoatesSky You are Not allowed into the UK Disney stores without a face mask as it’s company policy, they had someone on the door handing out masks to those without one. As a young person I am happy to wear a mask during this time and hope it becomes compulsory in shops. 
FAVOR	@GOPLeader It is because some GOP Congress people are not wearing their masks!!!For same.
AGAINST	@WVGovernor @WVNationalGuard Vote out RINO @WVGovernor @JimJusticeWV !!! We expected you to stand up for us against the Left’s Fearmongering! Even #FraudFauci admitted that masks don’t help &amp; can harm the wearer! Many people in WV have to work outside in the heat wearing masks! 
FAVOR	@Nitrozac @LizaYuzda @LaceyLaceyp @richardzussman @CBCtanya @Bernardo1130 and yet @DrBonnieHenry @CDCofBC still not a fan of requiring masks. It doesn't make sense. Even Trump and Pence have been wearing and promoting them and that's the bottom of the intellectual barrel!
AGAINST	@simondolan Went in Lidl in Letchworth. I was the only one in there without a mask. At the till, I looked behind me and a woman shopper was waiting. The next time I looked she had removed the mask from across her face to hang of her ear. As I left she had completely removed it.
FAVOR	What's with the no mask thing? Do you really think life saving health laws are unconstitutional? Are you saying its okay for waiters to not wash their hands before handling your food? Get with it folks! Just WEAR THE DAMN MASK #Masks
FAVOR	@JenniferJokes @rocko470033 @parkhurstcards Masks help to reduce viral load. You still might get Covid but you won’t get severely sick. Countries (eg: :flag_for_Slovakia: , :flag_for_Japan: etc) with mandatory mask wearing report new cases but look at their number of deaths-very low. If we’re smart, we won’t need lockdowns. 
FAVOR	Nothing like getting b*tched at by a Karen to ruin your afternoon. And of course, she was about a foot away from me and not wearing a mask. :face_with_rolling_eyes: Perfect.
AGAINST	You don’t wear a mask out of some noble notion you’re doing your part to save anyone from anything. You wear a mask because they tell you to, and you buy the fear. You’re not a hero out to save the day and we know it. 
AGAINST	@GovHolcomb Abby's is sweet &amp; Abby's parents are responsible for her. An entire state &amp; the healthy should never be told to mask up for those who may or may not need 2 stay home. Surgical/homemade masks don't stop a virus, never has, never will. Quarantining the healthy is ludicrous.
AGAINST	@Tepid_Safu @rgwarner @MayorofLondon Nope. I’m afraid they don’t.  *The virus is tiny and easily gets through a cloth or paper mask.  *they give false sense of security &amp;minimise hand washing *they prompt face touching *they are frequently worn incorrectly * they are a litter and infection hazard.
FAVOR	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.
AGAINST	People in the car alone, mask on, fogged up glasses, running red lights and shit. Fucking bozos.
NONE	@chico14436924 Dems are crazy and the people that vote for them are insane. If any political party let mobs burn down my neighborhood and endangered my family, I would never vote for them again. And guess what?This is way I will not be voting for a Dem again. #WalkAway #EndDemFascism
AGAINST	My 18 year old daughter proved today why masks don’t work and shouldn’t be encouraged or mandated ! She wore it on her head like a headband , wore it on her eyes, flung it across the room, and then I caught her chewing on it!!:joy::joy: 
AGAINST	Next time someone tells you to wear a mask, just respond with a confident "No." It's working. Stores are already realizing they can't enforce this. Politicians may not give up, but we can make their mask orders irrelevant. #NoMasks   Post your refusal story at

FAVOR	@CianchetteJack @TeamTrump @TrumpWarRoom @LaraLeaTrump I see a lot of robust bellies, no masks, no life preservers. You can almost feel the covid that’s inevitable. #COVIDIOTS
AGAINST	@IlhanMN Also because the majority of masks on the market, including the one your kid is wearing as a chin strap, aren’t medical grade and therefore do nothing.
FAVOR	I wish someone would tell the millions of medical staff world wide the masks they are wearing are:  &gt; Government tracking devices  &gt; Aliens that will attack and eat their faces.   I hope they find out soon. Thoughts and prayers.    #COVID19 #Masks

AGAINST	@sallyKP That is evil. That woman's mask isn't going to do much anyway. Unless she's wearing an N95 or better, what's the point? She's out in public at what seems to be a busy time. Then to say that to kids. Come on! I'm guessing she never got married, and never had kids.
AGAINST	@StatenIslandYRs @JoeBiden Where is #SleepyJoe going? And where is his mask? #hydroxychloriquineworks
NONE	So much for taking a baking class in VT in a couple of weeks. I could choose to quarantine first, but I have to work. Commercial rent forgiveness is not a thing.

FAVOR	@FIhornet C) We didn’t try herd immunity, it was abandoned immediately due to public pressure. You can’t compare the UK to NZ - the whole world travels through London. D) Masks are effective, but cloth face coverings aren’t, and that’s what most wear.
FAVOR	@HebOnTheWeb @caromaple Much as I would like to show my appreciation for all these brave souls who seem prepared to take a #coronavirus bullet for me, because the ‘arn’t afraid of the virus/flu’ think it’s a ‘plandemic’, ‘scamdemic’ or your just macho, you continue to spread it morons so

NONE	Any skincare suggestions for breakouts because of face masks?!:flushed: :mask:
FAVOR	@RightWingWatch What if, stay with me on this, the mask wasn't an affront to his freedom, but a statement about his compassion for others.  Also, he's f***ing idiot and we'd appreciate it if people like him didn't wrap their ignorance in our flag.
AGAINST	@yashar Idiots everywhere just falling in line w/the BS mask thing-wearing masks that DO NOT WORK to stop viruses. But hey, at least they make other morons feel better about their choice to fall in line.  This is beginning to look a lot like a religion. :man_facepalming: WAKE.THE.FUCK.UP. 
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto The Wuhan virus is now weaker than the seasonal flu. There are inexpensive, treatments. A vaccine is only a Big Pharma money maker. Masks are dangerous, they cause health issues. This is America, I don't need or want the Govt to make these decisions for me.

FAVOR	@DrEricDing I flew a few days ago. It was made crystal clear masks are be worn AT ALL TIMES in airport and on plane. Before we boarded @SouthwestAir nicely announced 'don't even think about not complying or you won't be flying'. To have the privelage to fly we must comply.
AGAINST	@BenIrvineAuthor I’m with you on that. I though Boris was a level headed politician, I’m starting to question that.  If you’re more comfortable wearing a mask for protection, then fien, wear one, but don’t force me to wear one too.  Masks only work if the person wearing it is ill.  
NONE	@Infinit45127710 Yes. My fav is the one that says it’s the only mask on the market to protect you from #COVID__19 ... #COVIDIOTS 
AGAINST	@dupjdpl @Sith_who_laughs @LouisianaGov You stay home while the rest of us LIVE LIFE WITHOUT MASK.  Y'all are a bunch of fucking sheep!   
AGAINST	@GovInslee I talk to a lot of people and we’re about to just quit wearing them. Enough truth and science out there to justify no masks. How many rights and freedoms are people willing to give up? We are there.
NONE	@SteveSchmidtSES @AmericanAir your not keeping the public safe.  Shame on you
NONE	Not a good day today!  UP Cabinet Minister succumbs to COVID-19. Union Home Minister tests positive. Tamil Nadu Governor tests positive. UP BJP President tests positive.  #StayHomeStaySafe
FAVOR	I live in a state with a Democratic governor. Masks in public places have been mandatory since at least June 1.  I shopped in 3 different stores today. Everybody was masked, and I didn’t hear a single “but muh freedums.”
AGAINST	@naijagyaldee Individuals completely incapable of logic or thinking for themselves are going around trying to intimidate people to wear masks. Unacceptable. He should be identified and charged under Section 4 of the Public Order Act for threatening behaviour at the very minimum.
FAVOR	For anyone claiming that fear is the killer and not covid: fear is an incentive for self preservation. Fear for others creates responsibility. It doesn’t have to be negative. It also helps you be a mask wearing informed human.  So yes I am afraid.   #COVIDIOTS
AGAINST	Your toilet cleaner being washed into my water is a chemical!  That's selfish to pour that in there.  Do you see the hypocrisy?  Seems we can find many things to call people selfish for.  #NoMasks
FAVOR	People in India are no longer serious about this situation. There are cases increasing everyday and people are getting careless. I am disappointed. So if not for your wear a mask for others.
AGAINST	@GavinNewsom You really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really DON'T need to wear a mask  #MaskOff
AGAINST	B &amp; Q and the off licence with no mask today. One other couple with no mask in B &amp; Q who smiled and said "Hello". No staff wearing a mask in B &amp; Q. Same with the man serving in the off licence:thumbsup:
FAVOR	@Dickeys Does @Dickeys require masks at locations or is it a manager discretionary decision ? #MaskUp #SafetyFirst
AGAINST	@w_terrence Mask violators? The left has severely brainwashed citizens this is an example of how much control they still have. It was never about health. #MAGA
FAVOR	@HomelessnessSD @victv This is ridiculous. I’m all for religion, just safe from my couch. As a San Diego women who got covid from a restaurant in Carlsbad. (Negative now). Wear a damn mask people, I almost died from this crap!
AGAINST	@davidicke I've had enough of this madness,I've seen and heard of false covid-19 cases.What happened is our care homes to people we love, is unthinkable.Small business are going down (myself included) and more.We need to take are country back.  We need to do something now!
NONE	@lsumner37 @axios @NYGovCuomo Same. So proud of our Gov. &amp; fellow New Yorkers! I’ll forget how Hov Cuomo would end reminding us that we were   Strong Smart Tough  Loving  Man, that always made me feel like we were going to get through this. Now we have to just keep it that way! #nytough 
AGAINST	Getting you used to a mask so you won't mind the burka quite so much.
FAVOR	I will be angry if I happily man ED wearing N95 entire time, stopped counting high-risk procedures or + pts, batch shifts to sequester in hotel to protect #CHD 13yo daughter, test 9x neg, all in last 6mo only to get #COVID19 from stranger w/ no mask.  AL pls
FAVOR	A mask is not a political statement ... it is an IQ Test!
FAVOR	Every day I hear the experts tell us, to wear a mask, social distance and avoid crowds. So how come we aren't doing it?? Trump keeps saying the virus is under control, but its not. .Abby if you stop liking to everybody we could get this thing under control.
AGAINST	Masks vs seatbelts. I know two people who were killed in a car crash (in the same car) several years ago. Both were actually killed by their seatbelts. One was decapitated by it. (They may also have died without them but we'll never know).
NONE	@simondolan Nowadays people will film their own mother dying if they thought would get loads of likes &amp; increased followers, where are all vids &amp; live films of people showing us how horrific it is/was whilst having #coronavirus, weight loss pics etc there is zilch #coronaviruscon
NONE	@BernieSanders The 14 days to stop the spread are over. It’s time to take our
AGAINST	@punmasterflash I have a problem in my county, I refuse to wear a mask and now I am not allowed to go into the stores to shop for groceries or to any place. If we all refuse to wear masks, no body can buy anything, they loose businesses and money. 
FAVOR	Another question...do the people wearing the masks below their nose know it is also connected to their lungs?
FAVOR	@ananavarro @nanelvisfan This pandemic, like any crisis, seems to squeeze the best and the worst of us out of the shadows. And he probably preaches about What Would Jesus Do. I’ll bet he’d wear a f**king mask.#COVIDIOTS
NONE	@tylerweichel @Prem_S Read and share the article too.  More people have to stand up to this authoritarian regime.
AGAINST	@ChristineBrett8 I am a teacher, and have just written to my union to cancel my membership because of the way they are supporting the despicable idea of children wearing masks.
AGAINST	Why do I refuse to wear a mask? Because...IT’S BEYOND FUUUCKING STUUUPID!!!
FAVOR	Ordered a mask that had a cute chain attached so you don’t lose it during the day :raising_hands_medium-light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	@Kr8cken @BradleyWhitford I did...  And it was at least 107° in #Tucson today  - so anyone outside the southwest can kiss my a** if they aren't wearing a mask "because it is too hot"  #WearAMask #Arizona #coronavirus
AGAINST	@IlluminateDark8 All except for the “put on your mask” part:joy::joy:. I don’t do that kind of shit
AGAINST	I have noticed that especially millennials see these face mask thing as a trendy one. Different colour, style. How pathetic is that?
AGAINST	@saundees21 @ this point, the ONLY people who gain "Protection" wearing a mask are the CRIMINAL ANTIFA, who can maintain a semblance of anonymity and HUMAN TRAFFICKERS.
FAVOR	@MikeoxlongUSA @10DowningStreet But far fewer, as they tend to adhere to the droplets of moisture in your breath and these get trapped in your mask.  You DO realise the point of a mask is to protect others rather than yourself, don't you?  
FAVOR	Face masks will now be compulsory on public transport says Minister @Ross_Shane1. Great that he's put an end to the 'maybes' and 'perhaps' ' which have delayed the decision by weeks.
FAVOR	All of you maskholes who say masks violate your personal freedoms, how you gonna justify that to your kids in December when they can’t go visit Santa at the mall? Mask up now. #COVID19 #maskup
AGAINST	@wjordan256 Let me guess if George Floyd would have had a mask on he'd still be alive.
FAVOR	26yrs old, finally figured out a skincare routine that works, hairstyle and clothes that I actually like, healthy eating habits and my career. I am FLOORED that I can’t go out to celebrate my glow up lol. Wear your fucking masks people. #WhatWomenReallyWantIs
FAVOR	“Non-medical, fabric masks are being used by many people in public areas, but there has been limited evidence on their effectiveness and WHO does not recommend their widespread use among the public for control of COVID-19.“ - World Health Organisation, 3rd August 2020
AGAINST	@sacbee_news Thanks for the admission that masks DON'T WORK!!
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto Covid19 virus size: from 0.06 to 0.14 microns, average is 0.12 microns  N95 mask (best one) filters 95% of particles down to 0.3 microns  Surgical mask filters to 1 micron  Fabric masks, at best, filters to 3 microns  So tell me, how do masks stop viruses?   
NONE	Can someone please do a "Downfall" parody of the mask situation? Long overdue if it hasn't been done yet. #downfall
FAVOR	@mdnij34 NO! The rules are the rules...No mask...find another way to your destination.
NONE	If there is more cases but there is declining deaths then isn't that herd immunity achieved?!...  #manchesterlockdown #lockdownextension #lockdown
NONE	“Practice Media Distancing” stay at least 50’ away from any TV or Radio that’s playing the news! #FakeNews #FakeNewsPropaganda #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #coronavirus #COVID19
FAVOR	@1TreeSantaCruz @hossehenad @tedcruz @AmericanAir YIKES! @AmericanAir is usually my preference.  Hard N.O. If they don’t enforce their mask wearing policy!  
FAVOR	Don't recommend going to Bottles and Stuff on Newburgh and 5 Mile. They're not enforcing/following the mask ordinance.  #Maskholes
AGAINST	Ppl in Wisconsin, call Speaker Vox and tell him HELL NO on this new face mask mandate, we haven’t been wearing them and shouldn’t have to be forced to do it...they can be voted out too if they can’t defend their constituents
FAVOR	@iheartmindy That’s because you’re a Karen and a trump lover. If you really cared for the people that deserve to live on this planet. You would wear a damn mask. Good luck for when you might need a ventilator soon. Us Normal people are going to wear masks to survive.
AGAINST	Am I the only one a bit worried about seeing legend Francous Pinaar, in a black mask, kneeling with a raised fist. It's very disturbing. Very wrong. This image is being imprinted on childrens brains....stop it now. #kbf
AGAINST	COVID-19 is SARS2 there is nothing to fear. Hospitals are getting paid to diagnose anything as COVID-19. This IS being used to make @realDonaldTrump look bad. It’s not working anyway.  #MasksWontHelpYou
FAVOR	There's many reasons someone may not wear a mask. The only one that should concern anyone is that it's none of your business. Protect yourself. #COVID__19 #MaskUp
AGAINST	Wearing a mask to stop the spread of Covid is the equivalent of adding a chain link fence to stop mosquitoes from coming in your yard.
FAVOR	@Newsweek These people with mask issues.  OMG.
FAVOR	@CheyenneNDN @Glowysoe @RobynFlowers18 @OGKBEAR @Dadilicious2 @KingRezizt @WeinreichHolly @realCheeto1 @NicoleNunn20 @ccsllew @AmateurMmo @Pittsburgbitch @leahbake @Duke_of_Phale @Burgh_bitch @cookiem89151957 @TroianoNic @JTSand138138 @TrumpBear4 @comeundone0 @AndyPadrutt @BResisting @JoeBiden @MeidasTouch @Eiggam5955 @brianlewis3282 @waltsimsjr @onit1977 @jenjones207 @BigPixieKiss @Flyin_Nrs @Peatches66 @Boomer818 @Jeff_resist @babaloo2 @TruthfulReal1ty @BradyBoo75 @AngBonCan @Wikweko @Brentp56 @WilliamFPeters2 @BackNBlack1975 @CapAmerica1111 @BogdanoffElaine @TCRG2012 @YetiEye @100Mohawk @BrahmaGreg @Rob83753057 @RandomFSM I don't get the fight against facemasks. Ppl have worn clothes, shoes, hats, etc for years. Ppl wear seatbelts &amp; helmets. Athletes wear padding. Men wear condoms. No one ranted that rights were being violated when all of that stuff became a thing.
AGAINST	@OANN Democrats call for a Nationwide "muzzle" Mandate, right Nancy? #COVID19
FAVOR	@waltermasterson @RexChapman Dude...don’t where your girlfriend/boyfriend’s mask next time.  #COVIDIOT
FAVOR	@TheTollington @AGildedEye @TomDCoates @NHSuk Thank you. I'm nowhere near you to come in:wine_glass:later, but appreciate yr efforts! I'm not front line acute (community hospital) but still had patients test +ve. Ppl are naive. Still threat. Easy transmission, horrible disease. Long term effects. V much not over. #2metres 
NONE	@NikkiHaley Starts with bringing the virus #s down. #testingtracingtrackingisolation once the #s come down, schools and businesses can re-open safely. This ain't rocket science. The alternative is more of the same, rinse and repeat. #COVID19sux #159Kdead
FAVOR	A to Z #NoMasks  Reason you r a Non-masker You are: Arrogant  Brainless Careless with others  Dumb Egotistical  Fox News Watcher Germ gigolo Hypocrite  Ill-informed￼ Jerk KKK sympathizer  Lame  Manic Narcissist￼ Oppressor  #Covid_19 #DrFauci #coronavirus #MaskUp 
AGAINST	@BeysBaeee @AlanMcleanCdn @thebobert @CP24 Dude you realise I can post thousands of articles anti mask right?
FAVOR	@funder I would hope the mask-less boobs are put on the No Fly List.
FAVOR	What’s wrong with people? Ware a mask and stay the heck away from others. It’s pretty easy! #COVIDIOTS #PhysicalDistancing #StopTheSpread #FactsNotFear #WashYourHands
AGAINST	Take the time to observe people. It’s truly free entertainment. Ate dinner tonight and watched these two people sitting together eating. Ome was lifting their mask each time they drank. No words. True insanity.
NONE	@hossehenad @tedcruz @Princeton should be proud. @Harvard_Law please stop accepting people of poor character
FAVOR	I come from 6 months into the future and let me tell you all you looked really cute in your christmas themed facemasks.  #christmas #facemask #facecover
AGAINST	@simondolan @bmstores Ooh, this issue has me conflicted; yes, masks for kids are abhorrent, but profiting from the stupid is so tempting... ultimately, i guess my moral compass would force me to do the right thing and boycott them though. A fool and his money... #idiots
FAVOR	Of course I have my first Karen sighting at the grocery store no mask buying a  cake. Brawl in self-checkout she leaves her station the store associate says I can use it I say no thanks and the four people behind me in unison go us either.
AGAINST	@WBTV_News Wait .. but I thought masks work !?
FAVOR	Also I’m sure since you are refusing masks, you will refuse any vaccine that comes out. I would also appreciate it if you stay the “f” away from me, my family and friends #COVID19AB
AGAINST	@dahboo7 And I can’t figure out why the govt wants everyone in masks of all things they could mandate? Why masks? Just to watch sheep follow fear and obey? There must be a reason. And Disney mandates 2 yr old and up to wear masks? There will be dead children! I don’t get it.
AGAINST	@petemorristwit I went into my local city centre today, only went Into one small shop, I wasn't wearing a mask neither was the assistant. Looking in other shops as I was walking past only about 30% of the staff were wearing masks but all the customers were.
FAVOR	Over 155,000 Americans have succumbed to Covid-19 and too many more will.  Your right to not wear a mask is disrespectful to all front line workers and your fellow citizens.   Your right to not wear a mask contributes to our country’s horrific toll.
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn Trying to be a smart ass!!!  Dr Fauci is the only expert we need!!! #TrumpDeathToll137K  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe  #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie  
FAVOR	I work 10 hours in a 96 degree wearhouse walking 20,000+ steps a day and lifting heavy boxes and I wear a mask. STOP COMPLAINING YOU CANT BREATH WELL ENOUGH TO WALK 30 MiN WITH A MASK. 
FAVOR	The gloves are officially off! I've had enough now! People blaming Front line NHS workers for this sh*tfest is where I draw the f*cking line! They are NOT where your blame lies! Management that implement and GOV that demand it! ENOUGH! #COVID19 #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	Oh look China getting more new cases. You still think that mask is saving you or anyone else.  You're less protected because most of you are ignoring social distancing rules, constantly handling your mask.
NONE	@HighlanderMSP @brawday @Feroxbill1 It seems that some people can't think beyond themselves and their needs. They will also be the people who complain if there is another lockdown, effectively caused by their lack of compliance. 
FAVOR	When people say “ depends on your view” about wearing masks means “I don’t give a flying f@ck about your view”. #entitled
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Look at all you assholes not wearing a mask.
AGAINST	Why is it #Hydroxychloroquine works everywhere else, but not in the #USA per #DrAnthonyFauci?   Because he doesn’t benefit financially from HCQ!  #WakeUpAmerica #FraudFauci
FAVOR	Hey @Target on Madison Avenue why are you not enforcing the mask mandate? Most of the people in the store today were not wearing them. I'm a frequent shopper but now I've grounded myself from in-store shopping. DO BETTER.
AGAINST	@iamdihealer @TheDemocrats @GOP @POTUS @GovInslee why are we ignoring Dr. Emanuel? Because it’s all about political war against @realDonaldTrump #voteliberalsout #OpenOurSchools #OpenAmericaNow
AGAINST	@PunishDem1776 HELL NO TO YOUR MASKS AND YOUR BULLSHIT AGENDA!!!!
FAVOR	Don't be a COVIDIOT...
FAVOR	@camstewarttheoz “...believing their “right” not to wear a mask was more important than killing innocent people.  ...Dave did everything he was supposed to do and you did not.  Shame on all of you and may Karma find you all.”  :pensive:  #Covid19 #Coronavirus
