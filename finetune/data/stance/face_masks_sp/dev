NONE	@EricDJuly Translation: Grandma touched her face after opening a door. Grandma didn't wash her hands. Grandma had a pre existing condition.  Why wasn't Grandma social distancing?  FEAR IS NOT A VIRTUE
FAVOR	@MotherJones Schools are petri dishes for any infection like flu .Any study that has been done abt kids is flawed because we protect our children,since March they have not been interacting with other kids. Reopening will cause outbreaks.Teachers,Staff,families  will be affected
FAVOR	PPL ask why 9/11 wasn't stopped. Just look at the lack of preparation and response from our government to #COVID19. Experts warned politicians about #terrorism, experts warned about #pandemics. This is our #WTC bombing. 9/11 will be the #SecondWave. Will we be ready?
AGAINST	@WSJ Be sure to ask Fauci about his financial interest in remdesivir and any COVID-19 vaccine.  Doubtful he will want to disclose this.

NONE	@Phreadys Absolutely not.  The least evil thing he’s done is to be in a conflict of interest.  That alone is enough.
FAVOR	What about the kids are being forced to go back to school because their parents are virus/pandemic deniers? Our kiddos are more aware than some give them credit for. That’s not an environment that promotes learning. That’s an environment that can create PTSD.

FAVOR	@JenniferJJacobs @doug_hanks @chucktodd Dr. Fauci saved us from this being worse.   He was the only guy well-liked enough by both parties to get the right thing done.   When this subsides, he'll be recognized as a true hero.  Woulda been much worse w/o his guidance.   #DrFauci  #COVID19
FAVOR	#coronavirus is going to keep surging if we don’t listen to the advice and follow the guidelines. Yes it’s boring, restricting but many people’s lives depend on it.
FAVOR	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren.
FAVOR	Where's #DrFauci already! #SenateHearing #coronavirus

AGAINST	@MartinSLewis @EndUKLockdown1 Whichever side of the fence u sit on, this lockdown is bollocksing small independent stores. Shops that rely on browsing &amp; comparing 1 shop to another.

NONE	@because_logic @Patter82Mike @B24Maria @UrielMWare @threeinct @catturd2 @CBSNews Percentage wise, the popular vote was a tie.
NONE	@tiaremarz Good morning my lovely friend  :rose::leaves: @tiaremarz :rose::leaves:  Your always welcome :kissing_heart::sparkling_heart::sparkling_heart:
AGAINST	If the US is so Pro-Life and cares about innocent babies, then why the fuck are trump and DeVos so hellbent on sending our kids to their doom at COVID filled schools?
FAVOR	I can tell u for free, @MYANC have so many tenders linked to schools, closing schools will mean closing thier Pockets, They rather see teachers and children with chronic illness dying of Covid-19 than losing thier bite on the 500 billion relief package.
FAVOR	After the weird #RushLimbaugh #SOTU Medal of Freedom thing, @realDonaldTrump fix its image by awarding it to #DrAnthonyFauci . @JoeBiden will YOU get it done? Ask @DrBiden! #Biden2020 #COVID19 #CovidUpdates #MAGA2020 #Fauci #FauciMedalOfFreedom @FauciFan #DrFauci   #AnthonyFauci
NONE	@realDonaldTrump Deflecting any way you can so people don't notice that over 138,000 Americans have died because you have failed to do anything during this pandemic except useless, nonsense tweeping. #EnemyOfThePeople #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsKillingUs
FAVOR	No vaccine, no school!  Kids are required to show vaccine records to set foot on any public school campus. Now we are letting that slide so they can pass around COVID and risk dying?
AGAINST	@OregonGovBrown I find it disturbing that at the beginning of the outbreak we had a month of lectures on how masks don't work, especially many from Dr. Fauci and I am wondering how anyone has any faith in him knowing he lied.  Random cloth coverings are not going to stop the spread
FAVOR	@TMZ @TooFab This is just so sad. My heart goes out to these people friend's and family, because they have to deal with the grief, because people try to act like this is nothing, and it's not nothing. Please #StaySafe, #stayhealthy and

AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump I know you think #DrFauci is on your side, but boy are you ever wrong. You're playing right into his hand. If you continue to listen to his partisan hacks you will not be voted into office again. #ReopenAmericaNow #leadership #COVID19
AGAINST	@DavidJHarrisJr He should know, he is in cahoots with them. This man is evil! #FearPimp #ArrestBillGates #GatesOfHell #FauciTheFraud
AGAINST	The brutal truth is that doing nothing and allowing the virus to do its worst would have been infinitely preferable to the misery and devastation being caused by the govt's insane actions. #COVID19 #COVID__19 #COVIDIOTS #Covid_19
NONE	@SenTinaSmith Unfortunately, this is common. Polarizing epidemic responses increase risk that healthcare workers become political targets! #AIDS and #Ebola provide lessons the U.S. ignores with #COVID19. Politicization, stigma, and racism are hazardous to our health!
AGAINST	Please @TuckerCarlson invite Dr. Stella Immanuel on your show very soon...   #FauciTheFraud
AGAINST	WHY did fauci on 60 min say Masks should not be worn by healthy people? And today he never mentions his HYPOCRISY :joy:
NONE	I was thinking schools and teachers will be rewarded for their tremendous efforts after coming out from  Covid 19 problem but the advisors of Govt think differently. @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj
AGAINST	@RonDeSantisFL You're not very smart are you? You politicised coronavirus at the expense of American lives. Closing up businesses again are you? You're not very smart.  A word is enough for the wise. #coronavirus

AGAINST	#DrFauci has been in charge of infectious disease for 30 years?   If that’s true why isn’t HE responsible for the response to #coronavirus ?  #CoronaUpdate @realDonaldTrump
NONE	@HeyTammyBruce He never had it.
FAVOR	@MSNBC All countries in the western world opening schools but let's see..we don't follow the science to open schools but we followed science to shut down..oh ok now that makes sense.
FAVOR	@ASlavitt And yet our #LiarinChief has not met with #DrFauci in 2 months. Instead he sends out the idiot sycophant @PeterNavarro45, who has zero medical training, to try &amp; force @US_FDA to push #Hydroxychloroquine on the public. These people are tryin to kill us.
AGAINST	@SRCC Stop allowing State Govs to keep most biz closed.
NONE	@JeffreyGuterman Go home and spread it to their parents, siblings, grandparents, neighbors, friends...  That’s obviously ok with this #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	. . . so about 30 non nursing home deaths. So the non nursing home death rate is approximately 0.0079 percent. This is not grounds to close the Loudoun County schools.  #COVID19Hoax
NONE	I hope we all learn from this experience... what @realDonaldTrump did yesterday in his coronavirus update was propaganda! He is playing politics with our lives ! Hopefully in Nov we can express accurate our disgust for these actions ! #WhiteHouseBriefing
FAVOR	@MinnesotaDFL Huh. Not to many, compared to all the worried parents, schools,teachers,and staff. @mngop , you don't even meet in person and hold legislative hearings on line.
AGAINST	@chuckwoolery @catturd2 Fauci has never been right about anything.
NONE	RT if you support Rand Paul. -- #DrFauci #COVID19

AGAINST	@CNNPolitics New York --  411k cases 32,167 dead  .0783   USA --  3.78 million cases 142k dead  .0376   Fauci touts New York as the "model" of success. :person_facepalming:
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Lame-o president not talking about how to actually control Covid or his new agenda, hes too busy trying to pat himself on the back with relevant propaganda,his ego is a fragile and inadequate barrier between him and the real world #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #TrumpVirus
NONE	@Zee24Kalak @DixitGujarat Do you think its right for the Gujarat Government to stop Private UnAided Schools from charging any fees till they reopen, while teachers are teaching online?  Looking forward to hear your thoughts?
FAVOR	#Fauci grew up a working class kid from Brooklyn, made it all the way to #Regis #HolyCross #ColumbiaUniversity Med School; he battled HIV/AIDS, SwineFlu, Ebola and COVID-19 and Trump cowards think they can scare him away? #DumpTrump2020 #Biden2020

AGAINST	@kylegriffin1 Meanwhile #DrFauci was having experiments done in a Wuhan lab with bats from the caves that scientists say the #CoronaVirus came from The Independent reported on that.
NONE	Coronavirus has me refreshing Twitter like I'm waiting for a snow day smy
AGAINST	So there is no #Covid_19 in Private schools?
NONE	@charliekirk11 Agreed!
AGAINST	If you’ve ever lived in a college dorm you’d know that COVID-19 is no match for the bugs that live in every college kids’ sink #washyourdishes
NONE	@MPRnews Interesting... is this the next reason you will use for #Minnesota's #COVID__19 number dropping @MDHCommMalcolm &amp; @GovTimWalz? We can read you like a very bad book.
AGAINST	Can someone tell me how I can get Fauci himself to tell me everything will be okay but that I should stay home still? #StayHome
FAVOR	@eNCA @SABCNews only PUBLIC schools will be closed??? What happens then to the PRIVATE school kids, are they not prone to contracting COVID-19, or are they moving their learning online? What then of the POOR kids???
FAVOR	Schools in Eldoradopark and Edenpark are closed as principals agreed with the parents that although school time is lost it's better for kids to repeat a grade instead of burying children #SchoolMustClose
FAVOR	WHY ARENT U CLOSING SCHOOL FOR CORONA VIRUS. No primary children with weak immune sustem needs this wtf
AGAINST	@Melissa20753729 Never! It’s a #Scamdemic which the brainwashed #sheeple and fascist elected officials like @GovMLG are perpetuating for nefarious reasons!
FAVOR	During a global public health pandemic, you listen to health experts- This isn’t debatable. The American people deserve the truth, and that’s what Dr. Fauci gave them. We were not prepared for the #coronavirus, even though we knew warned. Remember come November.
FAVOR	We have to wait for somebody to actually get the coronavirus in our school for us to close? Shouldn't we be closing the schools to prevent the spread of this?are schools that desperate for money to the point that they will wait for somebody to get infected?
NONE	@RealCandaceO If #Coronavirus starts bringing the dead back to life, I’d love to see how they whip out models that somehow tie back to a 500% death rate.
AGAINST	@CNNBusiness There is nob”new norm” you faithless hacks. There is only the fiction propagated by you, the rest of today’s media circus and the Democrats.
AGAINST	@DineshDSouza Any chance you can get @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @GregAbbott_TX to understand this &amp; not lock us down again. "I'll take how to lose a reelection for $1,000, Alex." #SuppressTheVote
AGAINST	0.02% chance of dying of #Covid and @GovInslee keeps our state in an “indefinite” lockdown. I’ll take those odd, thanks.
AGAINST	'If it saves one life...' the mentality behind demanding everyone wear #masks. Let's apply that same logic to #Hydroxychloroquine.  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #Fauci
FAVOR	@KristenhCNN #DrFauci has not been wrong!  #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
