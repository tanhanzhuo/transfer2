You have made yourself so foolish writing such a stupid tweet.I suggest you make yourself useful during this pandemic and not undermine the safe advice given by @DanielAndrewsMP .
AGAINST	It’s a shame the media &amp; pols have lost any shred of perspective during h1n1 pandemic the WHO estimated up to 1.4 billion ppl got the virus w 500k deaths ... did we cancel sports, business, life? Absolutely not we lived and moved on
NONE	@iam_johnw What’s with you’all never learning the lesson of jumping to conclusions. The dog pile thing is really ugly. You might want to work on that. This is just the beginning of folks losing it. We best have some empathy for the tragic back story we know nothing about :woman_facepalming_selector:
AGAINST	@Ljubica1 @NeilClark66 @CllrBSilvester So will you accept any and every law that is imposed on us just because he is the PM?   No matter how stupid, how pointless or how dangerous? Do you really think the title PM gives him total power over our ever move ? #notmypm #NoMasks
FAVOR	DON'T RELY ABSOLUTELY  on N95 , sanitizer or PPE   Only guarantee for covid-19 prevention is social distancing  Avoid crowds in any means
