NONE	@donwinslow This is nothing but the truth. Did Twitter censure the bounty Hoax tweet Trump put out, no they didn’t &amp; that tweet is a total lie. NATO and allies were briefed along with Trump himself. So no, @TwitterSupport, this video speaks the truth &amp; nothing is embellished.
FAVOR	And now #DrFauci is going into 14 days of self isolation because he too was exposed to the virus. Great job with the White House Coronavirus Task Force gang. We all need to hope that Dr. Fauci will be okay! #Covid_19 #coronavirus

NONE	@Phreadys Absolutely not.  The least evil thing he’s done is to be in a conflict of interest.  That alone is enough.
AGAINST	Mad the way they want you to wear masks in shops but everywhere else its sound not to. If thats the case no one should be allowed to touch stuff unless there buying it then? :thinking_face::joy:
AGAINST	I wore one yesterday because I felt scared by mask zombies  tutting and sniping  at me  when I  didn't wear one the day before.  On medical grounds,  I'm exempt  anyway . I'm NEVER  repeating yesterday's  experience again and will not wear a mask again.

FAVOR	@BBCNews 1. You are reporting 78% uptake on masks in many EU countries and 21% here while Brits stay at home to afraid to go out. Could the reason for this be the lack of mask wearing itself? I know its why I won't go out!
NONE	@FoxNews @ainsleyearhardt #COVID19  &amp; school.  More kids die from the flu each year.  More kids die at hands of abuse as at home not school.  #OPENAMERICANOW  use context!!!!

AGAINST	Please @TuckerCarlson invite Dr. Stella Immanuel on your show very soon...   #FauciTheFraud
AGAINST	All people who are wearing masks, and still feeling ok, you must be young and healthy.   The elderly seem to be dying a lot (as reported by MSM) they have ALL BEEN WEARING MASKS.   My heart goes out to all those who have been deceived by out world leaders.

FAVOR	Online teaching is also a service &amp; teachers need to be paid. Schools need to survive. Online learning helps increase computer literacy &amp; proficiency - essential skills for school and for life. Your order is regressive.

NONE	@JenniferJJacobs So he has a Cold? #CORONAHOAX #Scamdemic #FakeNumbers #FalseScientist
FAVOR	The colder it becomes the higher the level of Covid-19 cases rise...our children aren’t coping at all. Although the curriculum has to be covered mara not like this,come on now! Most of the learners are in hospitals right now, so what’s the use grand sharp?

FAVOR	I'd rather a child be held back a grade than to wipe out their immediate family members with this contagion. #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus #Covid19
NONE	Most are invested in thinking about continued learning for children. But for that to happen, schools must be able to collect what it rightfully due to them and pay their teachers and help them continue skilling up. They need as teachers to continue
AGAINST	@IngrahamAngle @stephphilip8 I'd like to grab that puny old madman by his Dumbo ears and heave him into a trash compactor.
NONE	@Vthomas_3 No Tests = No COVID-19
FAVOR	That’s a really good point made on @morningireland - if schools close will elderly grandparents end of minding children and increase their vulnerability? #COVID19 @Education_Ire #COVID19ireland #FlattenTheCurve
AGAINST	@JordanSchachtel Time to cut off #DrFauci from the decision making process. Thank him for his service and move on. #Economics have ALWAYS been a part of the healthcare decision making process. Why did we stop becz of #Coronavirus? When did we decide it was OK to come #Socialists? #endthelockdown
AGAINST	My mother is from Europe, moved here 40 years ago. Sterilization wasn't known to her, which is why her immune system is better than the average US citizen's. I see this from many people around me as well. Dr. Anthony Fauci is a liar and a fraud.  #coronavirus #COVID19 #DrFauci
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump get rid of Bill Gates buddy Fauci &amp; higher  Dr. Scott Adams where he actually knows the data &amp; facts of the #ChinaVirus  Bill Gates loves Epstein Island Fauci is his buddy in crime. I do not want pedo's telling me how to care for myself or my kids!!
NONE	I wish these so-called elite doctors would not only advise #SocialDistancing but also help people understand how to build up their immune systems but oh no, all they wanna push is big pharma vaccines.
FAVOR	All of you maskholes who say masks violate your personal freedoms, how you gonna justify that to your kids in December when they can’t go visit Santa at the mall? Mask up now. #COVID19 #maskup
NONE	@JaniceDean @dbongino I’m sure when he saysNY did it correctly,he’s referring to #KillerCuomo stopping the spread by sending the elderly to an early grave.

AGAINST	@ICMdoc @lyndsay_hopkins @ShippersUnbound Yeah.... Actually no, the guidance has been a joke &amp; the why has been for corporate money making.

NONE	This is like amputating a leg to cure a scrape on your knee.   Is this stupidity or malice? Both?  #COVID19
AGAINST	You know @realDonaldTrump you did it all wrong. You where suppose to demand that all schools stay closed, that way all schools would be opening!
FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln This COVID-19 data move away from the CDC has cemented my decision not to send my kids back to school in the fall. With the facts being covered up, there's no way to make an informed decision on risk.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Yet, you seemed to spare plenty of time for #DrFauci to come to your #PressConferences, or should I say, #MAGA #rallies? What are you afraid of Mr. #RealityShow #FakePresident? The #truth about how you #failed the American people on your handling of the #CoronaVirus? Just #Resign

AGAINST	@SaraCarterDC BS this guy has created chaos in the country!! Enough with games being glorified and real people being trapped in their homes masked !!

AGAINST	I am all set with #DrFauci the stuff that comes out of his mouth on #Coronavirus he contradicts himself a month later.  #Trump needs to set this guy free and like NOW!!
NONE	Across India, a whole spectrum of parents and the government have taken to systematic outrage and criticising of school's charging fees in the lockdown period. They say the phones, laptops and broadband charges are expensive and unnecessary.
FAVOR	@ewarren @JillSchupp Where is your mask?
NONE	If schools aren't going to open this year, can I get a refund on those school taxes I paid??
AGAINST	@8rareddy Classic!  The king of #COVID19 I’m sure they all got a chuckle out of that one.   Have you looked at this mans background and crimes against humanity?  #FauciFraud
FAVOR	@MBellmoore @edmontonleon @kindermeg You're a moron Mitchell. But I scrolled your TL, so it's not exactly a surprise to me. Don't like the mandatory masks, feel free to stay home, away from the people are capable of critical thinking

NONE	@NYGovCuomo #WashYourHands  #SocialDistance (no boat parties)
NONE	In regard to this, the Gujarat Government decided that parents did not have to pay fees and that term fees paid so far since the lockdown be refunded by schools to parents. This decision come as an extremely insensitive and dangerous step.
NONE	@Thomas1774Paine Dr. Judy’s book Plague of Corruption is nuts.
FAVOR	People who like to sew: a fat quarter of fabric is the perfect size to make two pleated masks :) cut it in half then in half again and double up two squares to make one mask. Make pleats By making 3-4 folds, sew the edges, and add ties. Done. #normalisemaskwearing

AGAINST	@TorieWatcher @DeAnna4Congress @JoeNBC @WillieGeist @morningmika @JoyAnnReid @sunny @donlemon @maddow @cindymccain This Dr Fauci belongs in Gitmo.
AGAINST	Masks are being proven for the rise in COVID-19, places which are now experiencing rising figures generally have mandatory masks. People are touching faces and are helping spread Coronavirus. The UK’s figures are rising, due to this very reason. #hancockmustgo #kbf
AGAINST	@StonyPlainAB if you don’t follow the ridiculous mandatory mask decision, your economy will boom!  @doniveson. We will bring the business to you!
FAVOR	Raging at the impudence around me. I keep meeting +Covid people who don't wear a mask whose family refuses testing and wearing masks but STILL go around the community. This is not a joke your SELFISHNESS is killing your loved ones, caregivers, my friends, humanity.
AGAINST	.@marklevinshow What you’re doing like you ALWAYS do. You’re putting COMMONSENSICAL, CRITICAL-THINKING to all of #COVID19 #FearMongering #’s. That has taken over the raines of our damn country, AND @realDonaldTrump &amp; @Mike_Pence are under the modeling spell of #DrFauci &amp; #DrBirx!

FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Trump lies, Americans die. Dr Fauci is our hero, he’s never surrendered to Trump &amp; the WH pressure of concealing the truth, like the others. Dr Fauci has endured tremendous resistance to keeping us informed. Without Dr Fauci we would be blinded to the pandemic.
NONE	You know you live in the United States when the higher educations get to close in midst of the coronavirus outbreak, but not the lower educations! :thinking_face:
FAVOR	I wonder if the people concerned about Co2 accumulating in their #masks and effecting how they breath, are the same people that don’t believe in the science behind the #ClimateChange?   
NONE	#DrFauci says “no evidence” of transmission of #Coronavirus from household pets to humans. #PressBriefing
AGAINST	@DavidAFrench @Jennanjack There’s never been a mask war. I wear one in public buildings, it’s about unconstitutional mandates. These are things all Americans use to agree on. And dumb ass #DrFauci lying in the first place.

FAVOR	Let’s agree that if you choose NOT to wear a mask in general public settings, then you forfeit any health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage and medical services by the front line workers the moment you COVID positive. Sign here.. #publichealth #COVID19 #insurance
AGAINST	#Covid19 killed 58 children under age 18. most are asymptomatic.  in 2017-18, the seasonal flu killed 188 children in the same age bracket. if they want to rely on data to open schools, I'm all for it. seems like a slam dunk to me.
FAVOR	My school only washes lunch tables with pure water; NOTHING ELSE. Fast and efficient way to get coronavirus.
FAVOR	Kenyan Education Minister recently announced that schools in kenya will remain closed until 2021. And yet in SA we have people like #angiemotshekga who think SA schoolkids are exempted from succumbing to the virus.
NONE	@RNSompura @mehtasumeet @Francis_Joseph @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh When we teach our students online, we teach them with 100% chapter clarity, we are covering up 100% syllabus. So its not only about cost bare by schools. Its about their teachers' 100% dedication. So i think the comparison is not correct.
AGAINST	@johncardillo @BernardKerik Fauci is the root problem of everything. How he hasn't been silenced may well determine this election.

FAVOR	.@SRuhle @FoxNews As a registered nurse, I value the important expert public health guidance provided by #DrFauci &amp; the stupid #FoxNews idiots &amp; cult followers are dangerous the wrong minded public health critics raise the risk of themselves being #COVID19 infected
FAVOR	@MaraJade_Sith People need to strap up and MASK up!! Americans sacrificed so much during WW2 and now they can’t even wear a mask at Target for 5 minutes without having a hissy fit!!
FAVOR	@HebOnTheWeb @caromaple Much as I would like to show my appreciation for all these brave souls who seem prepared to take a #coronavirus bullet for me, because the ‘arn’t afraid of the virus/flu’ think it’s a ‘plandemic’, ‘scamdemic’ or your just macho, you continue to spread it morons so
FAVOR	@jimdonovancbs3 @SEPTA No need to be patient. Not wearing a mask in public (as mandated by PA Governor) is the equivalent of swinging around a gun with the safety off; somebody’s going to get hurt. That said, I see Philadelphia P/O watch people walk around w/o masks and they say nada!
FAVOR	PPL ask why 9/11 wasn't stopped. Just look at the lack of preparation and response from our government to #COVID19. Experts warned politicians about #terrorism, experts warned about #pandemics. This is our #WTC bombing. 9/11 will be the #SecondWave. Will we be ready?
AGAINST	If you're a doctor and openly lie about life saving measures that has cost people lives you should be arrested not fired. #DrFauci #hydroxychloriquine
AGAINST	#Trump saying no live events until August/Sept. Not sure if this is his own made up shit, or if from #DrFauci Either way, we've got a lot of empty arena shows coming &amp; that's assuming someone from #wwe or #AEW doesn't get #COVID19 which could change everything #Wrestlemania
FAVOR	@drdave1999 @TweetOfBleep I'd like to learn what Fauci / #DrFauci said that was wrong. #Trump's list of wrong is extensive - whether on #coronavirus, history, geography, and so many other things.
FAVOR	@CarolCHinz The plot twist in the Covid story might be that kids wear masks better than adults! :satisfied: I’ve seen lots of chin protectors lately on grown-ups.
AGAINST	@RandPaul Get stronger as I don't remember anyone voting for #DrFauci!  #ReopenAmerica
FAVOR	Better to be safe than sorry. #OnlineClasses offer continued learning in a safe environment. Let schools function and provide education. It's easy to destroy with such senseless orders.
FAVOR	@thekenshain @TheJLV Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"
NONE	@TimRunsHisMouth What is that? He starts making fun of him and switches to being all smiley?! #CreepyJoe
NONE	@realDonaldTrump It "would be so great" if you resigned today.   Over 135k lives have been lost to COVID-19 &amp; you continue to do nothing.  You also think most have forgotten about the Russian bounties on our military, but we haven't.    #TrumpTraitor #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie

AGAINST	@GovAbbott I’ll bet that if the Feds were offering :moneybag: to open schools, you’d mandate they open ASAP. Stop the delay in #MclennanCounty
FAVOR	@donwinslow Trump is like the mayor of Amity Island in the movie Jaws. Demanding schools open is like demanding the beaches open
NONE	@meangene2030 @globetrotter764 @DeAnna4Congress Did #GeorgeFloyd die OF #COVID19 or WITH #COVID19?
NONE	@washingtonpost @RealDonaldTrump #DrFauci Donald, The #WashingtonPost can't be serious about what they wrote. I mean, there is over 1 million cases of the #Coronavirus #COVID19 currently in the United States. So how old is this news article and tweet? As it stands, the WP made an A$$ of us all.

AGAINST	Went shopping today w/o a mask.  Clerk was probably forced to have one but, kept pulling it down to come close and talk to me so we could actually communicate.  When they backed away for "social distancing" they pulled their mask back up.  Felt bad for him.  
FAVOR	@SoyBoyRoy1 @realDonaldTrump So the foxtrot uniform charlie kilo at least I'm wearing a MF mask. I have plenty. Worry about your germ spreading President who has no respect for the health of others. At least I respect my fellow American by wearing a mask. Do you? Good bye

NONE	The school and college are starting and colleges are increasing fees in this lockdown,they are not going to teach us practically nor they can pay attention every student,why are they increasing fees and taking all fees together,please do something about this sir
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Why do you continue to be such an idiot? Testing has nothing to do with more cases. The cases are there; it’s just whether you are aware of them or not. If you aren’t aware, people contribute to additional spread. This is why we’re not at better here. Believe science.
FAVOR	So. What are we MISSING while Donald &amp; betsy promote reopening schools?  Tax returns? Rigged 2016? Rigged 2020? The siphoning off of USA $$$ to Russia &amp; China?   MARY TRUMPS BOOK?   Donalds escape hatch getting readied?
AGAINST	@jaketapper Then maybe you should talk to the DOCTOR who said masks weren’t needed in February &amp; March!!!!!!   #DrFauci
NONE	@brhodes @realDonaldTrump You were silent for the #CoronavirusPandemic, does that mean you are  resigning #COVIDIOT -in-chief ? #TrumpLiesAmericansDie  #TrumpLiesKidsDie

FAVOR	Schools must shutdown I'm not sending my child to school
NONE	Due to the long shut-down, parents are finding it difficult to pay the school fees. Schools are refraining from pressurising parents on humanitarian grounds.
NONE	@nick_ramsey can't she just email the binder out to everyone and skip the propaganda sessions?  #PropagandaBarbie #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirus #ETTD
AGAINST	@CBSNews Fauci is a fraud and a liar. He’s an actor that’s only out for fame and fortune.

FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln I just said you must have masks. Some can say Lincoln Project, perhaps Wear A Damn Mask. They will fly off the shelves. #LincolnProject
FAVOR	Without a #vaccine for #Coronavirus what good does #flatteningthecurve do? Once we stop #SocialDistancing the infections will rise won’t they? Haven’t heard #DrFauci speak to that yet.  I want him to talk, not the #FakePresident. Im just a dummy pipefitter in need of an answer.
FAVOR	People in India are no longer serious about this situation. There are cases increasing everyday and people are getting careless. I am disappointed. So if not for your wear a mask for others.

NONE	Before asking schools to not charge fee for providing service of online education, gujrat government should have arranged free online education to all students of gujrat. Very bad and sad sermon
FAVOR	And yes, I've decided to homeschool &amp; I know that's not an option for everyone, but it's very blasé to say "Just keep your kid home" because those kids &amp; teachers will be spreading it to their families &amp; others &amp; into the community. Reopening schools is a big mistake.
AGAINST	@ProfessorSnarf @AlexBerenson @WHO Tests have also shown that oxygen levels decreased with the wearing of masks. I can’t breathe in a mask and am also depriving my body, mind and vital organs of life dependent oxygen when wearing a stupid tyrannical face mask. 
NONE	@ExileOC I just also can't understand why she accepted masks from Taiwan if she wasn't going to use them. They shipped over 20,000 face masks! #LieCheatSteel

AGAINST	STOP :stop_sign: wearing mask :mask:!! There is no standard, even medical grade will not stop viruses. They are mean to produce fear and submission to government rule. If we all stand up they will loose control.
FAVOR	Masks look to be part of our lives for some time to come, so it's more economical (and eco-friendly) to buy one or two cloth masks that you can wash and wear again. They're widely available (look online) and come in a huge range of patterns and colours.
AGAINST	Please reopen the schools
NONE	@yvonnebilowus Covid was spreading before and after protesting and not to mention the Karen's and Kyle's who refuse to wear a mask because "it violates their constitutional rights." Wonder if those fools wear seat belts. :thinking_face:  What's that Bible verse about no Greater love?  #BLM
FAVOR	@RhapsoDani I hope quarantine doesn’t mean you don’t get out for walks almost daily, which is good for you &amp; critical for kids; if you social distance it doesn’t present a serious risk. Those w underlying conditions should be able to get a KN95 mask, which protects the wearer 
AGAINST	The Left is super supportive of rape survivors when they choose an abortion but calls them “selfish bastards” when they can’t wear masks due to trauma. Keep it up Dems. #VoteDemsOut #RedWave2020 #NoMaskMandates #MyBodyMyChoice

AGAINST	Mask mandates are unconstitutional! #RecallGavin2020 #RecallGavinNewsom #FireFauci
FAVOR	I believe #DrFauci. #COVID19 isn't under control. The pandemic is taking American lives &amp; devastating our economy because @realDonaldTrump has denied facts &amp; science every step of the way. He couldn't demonstrate leadership in a conga line. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
AGAINST	Went in three charity shops, A Greggs (:pensive:) and my local music shop today.  No mask worn, no fucks given. #COVID19
AGAINST	@Linda36758099 Sheeple on the radio this morning complaining that the police are not fining those of us who are not wearing masks. Shit bags!

FAVOR	@supergeenie @RBReich We NOW have Thousands of maskless churchgoers congregating together on the beaches of hot spot California. No masks. For civil liberty. I guess the constitution guarantees the Unalienable right to spread their disease.
FAVOR	@36WorkingMan36 @realDonaldTrump Ok, well. Fauci advised wearing masks. Trump spent 4 months denying that was needed and even went to medical centers without one. Trump compromised a batch of tests by not wearing PPE inside the lab. Trump has failed.
FAVOR	Public schools will start out with remote learning at the beginning of the school year here in North Texas.  Private schools have not made the same announcement.  So my kid will not be saturated in neither COVID nor smug privilege while learning this year.
FAVOR	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back
FAVOR	Here’s a thought... Am I right?  America is currently close to 1 in 16 deaths from Coronavirus... old mate Rand Paul wants to look at Sweden’s system... who are currently at 1 in 8 deaths. To overlook the medical experts medical opinions... #DrFauci #CoronavirusLockdown #America
FAVOR	@GaydosKTAR Trump has cancelled the RNC Convention in Jacksonville, FL due to concerns about #covid19.   Gov.

FAVOR	I just saw a tweet that said something like “I don’t want to wear a mask cause then it’ll be normalized.”   If you don’t wear a mask NOW, it WILL become normalized and become part of every day life even after this. So wear it now, so we don’t have to later.
NONE	@Colin_H_Turner He doesn’t have our best interests at heart. He’s clearly compromised any shred of principles that he maybe once had, pushing for shutdowns until his financiers have a mediocre vaccine they can make billions off of down the road.
FAVOR	Trump is NOT an educator and he's NOT a doctor why would anyone listen to Trump over our educators who have been in the classroom?? We know the nature of students and we know students Will Not social distance or keep their mask on.... They're Children

AGAINST	@DeAnna4Congress Fauci is heavily invested with Bill Gates as far as a vaccine is concerned. They stand to make Trillions if our government makes the vaccine mandatory! Fauci is an imbecile.
NONE	2. It's definitely World War 3!   Coronavirus is the Invisible Enemy!  Mass graves... being dug out... that sounds like a War to me.   But how do we win?   Where do we run to?   How do we survive to tell the story?

FAVOR	I just heard on the radio, that SA will close a school IF a case of Covid-19 is confirmed. Isn’t that a bit like closing the gate once the the horse has bolted???
FAVOR	What's the meaning behind the #fauciwink? #supportpublichealth #wearamask
NONE	@LanaMurphy Out on bail, does that send the right message?  Is this on the same day the largest on the spot fine was created?  Sending some mixed messages here, is the pandemic and wearing mask a serious matter or not? #COVID19Vic

AGAINST	@WashTimes Given how wrong Dr Fauci was during previous pandemics (SARS, etc) going back almost 40yrs he might just be a quack milking the moment (bad enough) but given his noted love &amp; support for Hillary Clinton he might be trying to steer Trump into political suicide #COVID19 #DrFauci

FAVOR	"Schools will now be the experiment," Carroll says. "We're going to see a bunch of schools open with varying levels of control, and then we will see what happens." See what happens? Our children dying is not an experiment.!

FAVOR	@Laurie_Garrett @CDCgov @WhiteHouse So grateful for the clarity and courage with which you speak. The seeming capitulation of the CDC to White House pressure is chilling. The greed and incompetence driving this "push" to reopen schools is horrifying. I hope to god people listen to you.

AGAINST	@IngrahamAngle @KathyMillerDC @bigleaguepol This is because he positioned to profit immensely from a vaccine. When was the last time #Fauci treated a patient? Answer... decades! He needs to be prosecuted for causing the deaths of thousands of Americans?

AGAINST	A few people recently told me on FB, with regard to a diff of opinion on the effectiveness of masks against Covid, "Your opinion doesn't matter. Keep your mouth shut and do as you're told." Now think about that. That may be THE scariest thing I've EVER heard.  #COVID19

AGAINST	Every lockdown has had One Common Clause “Essential Services” to be on.  So are you saying Education is no longer “Essential”? When did education become a luxury and not a necessity? #TeachersLivesMatters #RighToLearn
NONE	@SaraCarterDC People are not dying from influenza, heart disease, or pneumonia now a days, if they could throw car accidents in there with the covid-19 they would but paper trail would be too long.. yes its a virus like many others but our bodies are built to fight them.
FAVOR	Putting this out for the world out of true curiosity. For people who choose not to wear masks. What would you have to see in order for you to put one on? #facemasks
NONE	@duty2warn But it’s a hoax, with #’s made up by Dems   #Karma
FAVOR	I am sick to death of you selfish fuckers openly defying store policy and walking around with no mask and daring  someone to challenge you. To the teen whose father dragged her into his narcissism, I apologize for my language. But fuck you too.
AGAINST	How many #coronavirus patients has as #DrFauci or #DrBirx personally treated? 1?? 2?? None??? Zero??  Yet the World Listens: They have no hands on knowledge of #COVID19 only DOCTORS with REAL PATIENTS have KNOWLEDGE!! #SaturdayVibes #SaturdayThoughts
NONE	@CNN Fact: In 2018-1.5 million people worldwide died from Tuberculosis. 10 million people fell ill with Tuberculosis and we weren't mandated to wear masks. “World Health Organization “
AGAINST	My question to South Africa is....till when are you going to sit at home and wait for things to go back to normal,what if things never go back to normal,what if the vaccine takes 10 years to reach you,think about that too.
FAVOR	@CP24 Why are we NOT talking this seriously in Canada? Why are we so arrogant to think that we are immune to this!? Why would the convention take place??? This is insane. #COVID19
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn And what exactly are you doing to make schools any safer, Senator?  Teachers and students need PPEs and testing.  Most school don’t have nurses or even money for sanitizers and tissues. You want all kids going back to school without safeguards?
FAVOR	I don’t get why we are waiting for coronavirus to get to our campuses before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the campus so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it
AGAINST	@drdavidsamadi @TheDamaniFelder I wish they would replace Fauci with you!!
NONE	Where is #DrFauci????  #COVID19
NONE	@Janet4II Hell fucking no
FAVOR	@brad_dickson My son teaches in Japan. They wear masks because they are a polite society. School closed asap in Feb. Did remote learning. But as of early June, back to in school learning due to so few cases. Masks work.

FAVOR	@ScientistMel Also sorry that just hit my funny bone I know you dont have an opinion either way :grin:.  Also everyone #WearAMask
FAVOR	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV &amp; only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin.
FAVOR	This is so stupid. Someone has to fricking get corona virus in order for the school to close :face_with_rolling_eyes:
FAVOR	@FoxNews @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson Why must you continue to downplay #COVID19 and push to destroy #DrFauci? This is real and serious. #BoycottFox

FAVOR	To anyone that thinks schools should open in regions with outbreaks, I invite you to become a teacher and put your money where your mouth is. There will be plenty of openings in the next two months. You're only sharing a classroom with 40 to 300 people per day.
AGAINST	#DrFauci wants fear.  Fear makes people stay home. It lessons herd immunity and prolongs the whole cycle.   That damages the economy more and hurts POTUS.   Then Dems come riding to the “rescue” with this digital certificate/mandatory vaccine BS. #coronavirus #Covid_19 #COVIDー19
FAVOR	Don't recommend going to Bottles and Stuff on Newburgh and 5 Mile. They're not enforcing/following the mask ordinance.  #Maskholes

FAVOR	@Reuters @WritesMore Guess they were too busy watching @FoxNewsSunday to have seen the video of the man who refused to wear a mask, tested positive, died with regret over his bad decision. 
FAVOR	Sorry but if the worst thing in your life right now is being expected to wear a mask to help keep people alive, shut up and put it on, please.

FAVOR	@StopandShop Hey there..“No Mask No Service” is not being enforced in your Hempstead trpk and Wantaugh ave location. Have to stare down folks with a chinstraps every turn I make. I care about my senior mother that I take food shopping! This is pitiful! #StopAndShop
NONE	Educational Department said that many schools have either not paid any salary or paid only 40-50% salary to their staff during the period of the lockdown. I don't know where they got the data from. I am a teacher and I have received 100% salary, on time.
AGAINST	@Marsha250 After #DrFauci's admission this is no more than a bad flu season @POTUS is the one media will blame for unneeded panic  We've told our prez for three months to #FireFauci   I still suppt @realdonaldtrump bt he must #UnlockAmericaNow     #COVID19
FAVOR	@texan_maga @HLAurora63 @FoxNews Hes not ...he hadny firex Fauci yet.   Thats on him.
FAVOR	In my opinion, we should have home school or distance schooling for our children. It’s not just the Corona Virus we need to worry about, but violence. Our kid’s will be picked on or beaten on just because of skin color! Bullying will increase.
AGAINST	Any one else notice how the people tut tutting at non mask wearers and pub goers, are the same ones who in ordinary times wouldn't know a good time if it bit them on the bum. You know the sorts, you usually see them sporting high viz vests at the village fete.
FAVOR	I'm privileged to stay home &amp; still work, allowing my kids to stay safe. Most people aren't that lucky. We need schools CLOSED and RELIEF for workers who can't stay home with kids. The economy returns with MANDATED MASKS &amp; a flattened curve, not the other way around.
FAVOR	Wearing a mask and social distancing doesn't mean you are "living in fear." It's like wearing a seat belt or using your headlights in the rain, it's for your safety and the safety of others.
AGAINST	Save schools
FAVOR	Insults were hurled at @MmusiMaimane and we were cyber-bullied for supporting the call for schools not to reopen under unsafe conditions. Y'all are a confused bunch. Honestly.
AGAINST	@simondolan @bmstores Ooh, this issue has me conflicted; yes, masks for kids are abhorrent, but profiting from the stupid is so tempting... ultimately, i guess my moral compass would force me to do the right thing and boycott them though. A fool and his money... #idiots
AGAINST	The World needs almost 69 million new teachers to reach the 2030 Education goals. How will we hire and retain good talent in our schools if we cannot pay them well?  @CMOGuj @imBhupendrasinh  #SaveOurSchools

AGAINST	@GovInslee I don’t care what anyone thinks of my choices. No one should. You are creating an environment of fear, tattling &amp; abuse regarding the masks. All the while IGNORING your responsibility regarding the riots. Get rid of these #AntifaBLMDomesticTerrorists
FAVOR	@cityoftoronto Maybe get a washable, reusable mask.
AGAINST	People are going to start getting sick soon from all the mask wearing, I already spoke to one woman today who had collapsed from lack of oxygen.
NONE	If Private schools have earned for many years and so should not take fees for a year than logically speaking Government is collecting Taxes since 1947 so they should also give all services like petrol, electricity, water for free for one year. Shouldn't they?
NONE	@JudicialWatch @hevasomefnu Why did Hillary not go in front of a grand jury, for lying while under oath to congress?  #EndDemFascism #ObamaGate #WalkAway #AllLivesMatter #BLMTerrorists #EndShutDown
NONE	If the fees are to high then bann the electricity bill and gas bills. Can you do this? How can you say this that fees are to high? If you want good education then you have to pay the fees. That's why people their first choice is private schools not government
AGAINST	@thehill #FauciLiedPeopleDied he changes his prognostications when it SERVES his needs. First he says Masks NOT necessary THEN they are:joy:. He SAID years ago #Hydroxychloroquine was GREAT today he says NOT. #FauciTheFraud

FAVOR	@joshi_speaks @zoneanthony @anubha1812 I think best option for parents who are not satisfied with online classes is to shift to government schools or take a drop of one year. Many parents are happy with the online classes and let them take the advantage of it.

AGAINST	@RandPaul @GovRonDeSantis @NYGovCuomo Nope. @DrAnthonyF is enjoying the power he now has. Instead of helping he is doing nothing but circumventing the President and holding his own news conferences. He won't even question Cuomo's piss-poor actions/decision on NY nursing homes

AGAINST	And we do not know when these physical classrooms will happen. Parents cannot manage with apps at home, and the skilled teachers are preparing to normalise as far as possible. Till now it is ok. What if schools dont open till December? Year gone?
AGAINST	@RedNationRising Do they forget there’s cameras everywhere or are they that brazen?  Rhetorical question, they know the media will cover and dumb sheep will still scream “ wear your mask!!!”
AGAINST	@Theresa_Chapple @jsrsba Honestly I seriously doubt they died FROM covid.   Would be nice to know details. Do you know how many children died from the flu and also on the way to school last year.  Also how many died of child abuse during lockdown ? Life’s complicated
FAVOR	@Walgreens @WAGSocialCare just left your Grayslake store. Shift leader Shannon wearing only a thin silk bandana instead of a proper mask. DO BETTER!

NONE	@MamblamOBB @Dajody1 @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Dems applaud mediocrity and failure.
AGAINST	Trying out @Walmart curbside grocery pickup so I won't get scolded or kicked out for #NoMask. Not sure if this is convenient or dumb. The pickup process they gave me acts like either I or the store employee is scared to death of #Covid19 #WuhanFlu #ChineseVirus.

AGAINST	@newsmax Absolutely not. The cdc is saying this isnt even an epidemic anymore as deaths are way down. This clown needs to be fired and jailed for destroying millions of lives with unnecessary lockdowns.
AGAINST	@drdavidsamadi When are we all going to put an end to this and just refuse to wear a mask and open our Country up?!
NONE	How do you sleep at night @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WhiteHouse with so many of our citizens sick and drying? Your line in the sand is a mask? Your line in the sand is a mask!!!! Pathetic! #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
AGAINST	@LewisHamilton Then use your position to fight for the right of all human beings to live their lives freely, to go where they want, to breathe the air and not wear a mask. Next race do us all a favour and dump the mask. Make a stand for humanity. 
FAVOR	@hoaghealth Your own doctor, Dr. Jeff Barke, is now infamous for not wearing a mask and telling anyone who will listen to his numerous media statements to also not wear a mask. Why does he still have privileges at Hoag? #NewportBeach #HuntingtonBeach #Coronavirus
AGAINST	@chuckwoolery @TTysonToni1 @gatewaypundit This is all part of a large misinformation campaign. Trying to classify as many deaths as possible in the category of Coronavirus makes the numbers inflated and distorted. It also wreaks of politics.

FAVOR	I have an idea. Everyone has their temperature taken at the entrance of the bar. Everyone not wearing a mask gets it taken rectally.
NONE	2. The leadership from gov on this has been appalling on this. We need a CLEAR info vid put out on SAFE mask wearing &amp; storing as I've seen some ridiculous examples of misuse which is probably worse than not wearing one!

FAVOR	@MarkRuffalo I’m spending the summer holiday in Northern Italy where masks are mandatory in stores. I thought it would be bad but it’s not especially when you know you safe lives.
AGAINST	So there is no #Covid_19 in Private schools?
FAVOR	Wearing masks during the pandemic is obviously a necessity, and those that aren't are just selfish or moronic. I wear a neck gaiter mask and it doesn't bother me at all, in fact it makes me feel better (probably due to my anxiety) - Am I alone in feeling that way?

FAVOR	@LaVeterinarian @NeilClark66 Exactly. This is why I have no sympathy for anti-maskers who get COVID and die. They are selfish assholes that don’t understand or care about simple science. Your mask doesn’t protect you, it protects me, and my mask protects you.
AGAINST	I just casually walked into Dunkin Donuts, went to the counter, placed and paid for my order and exited. All without a mask.  No one said a thing, even though they all had masks. We have to start living like normal human beings.
FAVOR	If you can find a better place to buy gas than @Wawa - do so. I went to buy pretzels at Lionville 113 store and a white male was brazenly in the store without a mask. You need to refuse service to people not wearing masks. #WearAMask

NONE	The Federal Government has on Monday, 13th July, 2020, released guildlines and requirements for the reopening of schools at all levels though no date of resumption is yet to be announced.  The big question is can students cope?  #CNUI #COVID19

AGAINST	@KateBolduan @CNN But make no mistake. Wearing a mask is UNHEALTHY and makes society as a whole more susceptible to more illnesses and viruses, causing individuals to chronically inhale what their own bodies are trying to expel.

FAVOR	@GOP Look what happened in Israel when they opened schools. And they had Covid under control at the time. It's fucking raging here.
FAVOR	#DonaldTrump is misleading the public and #Republicans allowing it. We must stop #Trump by voting home out of office.  This is awful. #DrFauci is a truth teller &amp; now he is silenced. Just like in China. #COVID2019 #coronavirus #Corona #cnn #MSNBC #nbc #bbcamerica #WashingtonPost
FAVOR	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT

NONE	@DoniTheDon_ About damn time.
FAVOR	@donwinslow @Fythia Trump wants schools open so he can say things are opening up. Trump thinks that opening schools and opening the economy will help his re-election bid. Trump does not think about the children at all.

FAVOR	I didn’t realize DT maliciously hid the CDC recommendationthat NO SCHOOLS should open. How can anyone in education ignore experts? Hoping school districts send a clear message to politicians NOT to play politics w/our children. This is not a good experiment.
AGAINST	I bet I wake up to masks being mandated :mask:   At least not wearing one won’t land people fines or citations; yet.   #COVID19
NONE	Given that the govt has an established track-record of  measures which push large sections of the population into precarity, would it not make sense to question whether lockdown is a continuation of this pernicious theme? Deafening silence from the left, IMO! #Plandemic

AGAINST	@WeAreCanProud This goes beyond any logic. So if In 3, 4,5 maybe 6 months there have been no new cases anywhere they still think we should be doing this crap. Wake up people, there is more going on here. If they would only commit to thresholds I would trust them more. #FakePandemic

AGAINST	FYI: I emailed local mp @DehennaDavison a couple of weeks ago about how making masks mandatory would adversely affect people's mental health, especially among the already vulnerable, leading to suicide rates going up. Got a calloused copy &amp; paste reply. #bloodonherhands

FAVOR	I guess I should’ve know any effort to flatten the curve that depended on an overwhelming majority of Americans to refrain from being self-centered was doomed to fail.
FAVOR	@cher WI Gov Evers just passed mandatory masks statewide effective today. GOP state legislators already fighting the mask law and threatening lawsuit to WI Supreme Court to overturn. New WI SC Dem Justice just took seat today. So GOP may not succeed:double_exclamation_mark_selector::pray:
FAVOR	@donwinslow Thank you for creating such a poignant reminder that children should not bear consequences of adult failures.  #COVID19 is more of a threat than it was in March when schools closed.  For now
FAVOR	@Walmart start protecting your employees and customers and start regulating and mandating masks. I probably have it already as well as 8 other associates in my neighborhood market.  Please at least pretend you care.  They actually help. 
NONE	@ClayTravis @JohnCooper4Nash It’s not about masks. It’s about the Teachers Union twisting the tax payers arm for more money. Where does it all end?  Money obviously doesn’t fix failing government schools.

FAVOR	@CNN @DrSanjayGupta | #DrFauci's projection of "only" 100,000 to 200,000 deaths by #COVID19 is based on "aggressive" implementation of #SocialDistancing and #IsolationAtHome from now on.  How's that going Florida, Alabama, Texas et al?

NONE	Why only private teachers are always targets by the people who are not sending their children to a good school and always opposing the functions of good schools. Government teachers are receiving their full salary in account in every month with doing nothing.
AGAINST	@catturd2 @Dslayer298 Unfortunately, until @realDonaldTrump kicks the soapbox out from underneath Dr. Fauci, the Democrats will still have their go to excuse, to continue their state shutdowns and mask mandates. Why President Trump is keeping him around goggles the mind.

FAVOR	@MaryEllenKlas @GovRonDeSantis FL #Covid19 cases are going :arrow_up: not :arrow_down:. @GovRonDeSantis re-evaluate that. The workers within the school system are mainly in the "high risk" Bus Drivers, Teachers, Aides, Administration, Custodial, and support staff.  #SocialDistance in already overcrowded classes??
FAVOR	@W7VOA @GOPconvention You do realize adults work at schools, so chances are my colleagues, their family, my family and myself have a high risk in contracting the virus and possibly dying.
NONE	I will NOT get any VACCINE for #COVID19,
FAVOR	— frickin’ idea what they’re talking about and how people like her are part of the problem. Sure, masks aren’t the cure for #COVID19 . But it certainly helps in being a preventative from the spread of the virus. So, again, #WearAMaskPlease.

FAVOR	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump @US_FDA @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @POTUS If you’re dying from #coronavirus #COVID19 why can’t you try ANYTHING YOU WANT @US_FDA ? #RightToTry #Remdesivir too expensive and doesn’t work well enough.

FAVOR	Spent some time over in England (specifically Derbyshire) for a week. I've a few observations. 1.) From what I saw, mask use in pretty much ubiquitous. 2.) Going into shops is logical, organised and polite. 3.) Coming back to Wales, hardly ANY people wear masks. Scary.

FAVOR	@JenniferJJacobs @doug_hanks @chucktodd Dr. Fauci saved us from this being worse.   He was the only guy well-liked enough by both parties to get the right thing done.   When this subsides, he'll be recognized as a true hero.  Woulda been much worse w/o his guidance.   #DrFauci  #COVID19

FAVOR	Trump wants you to hurt your own child by opening schools for his reelection.
AGAINST	@AlexBerenson Teachers unions suck! Open up the schools!  They were open months ago in Europe, China and everywhere else in the world. Kids don’t spread the virus per the European study.  And mask don’t work (even the fraud Fauci said in March)
AGAINST	@KOCOAbigail maybe a better story to air would be the Giants pitcher chose to stand during the national anthem, or maybe the great Dr. Fauci had his mask down and lied about taking a drink.  #OpenTheSchools
AGAINST	@Mr_PharaohMan No! I went in the dollar store and they made us wear a mask! I was in there for maybe 10 minutes and I almost passed out! The lady at the register made me take it off, and told me I didn’t have to wear one! It’s obvious there is a medical reason some of us can’t!
FAVOR	@ASlavitt Wait unti @GovTimWalz allows schools to reopen. #NotMyChild
AGAINST	@10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @CMO_England This is idiotic. There are barely any hospital admissions let alone deaths &amp; no scientific evidence to support wearing masks. #PHE death stats were ‘misleading’ so end this madness. Give us back our freedom. #EndLockdown

AGAINST	@BenPBradshaw Because the best scientists, virologists and biological experts taken from WWII have gone.  What replacing them now are politicians, capitalists and warmongers masqueraded as #coronavirus experts.   #DrFauci will tell you more.
FAVOR	Went to the gas station yesterday and I was the only one wearing a mask. Did I cough as I put my beer on the counter? Yes. But I resisted the urge to say “Is the kitchen closed tonight? It usually smells like cooking food in here.” So not a complete bitch right?

If you want to place blame
FAVOR	@kylegriffin1 Neither should we think that #RandPaul knows more about #COVID19 than the experts. But given the choice, I'll bet my life on #DrFauci and the other experts. It's what they do. If you follow Rand Paul's advice instead, good luck, and I'll see you on the other side. #GOP

NONE	I’m not sure what the right answer is on schools opening.  We need a better debate than privileged people and/or those with no school age children adamantly against it vs. an incompetent president blindly pushing for it.
FAVOR	I mean, I get it, a mask is uncomfortable, it fogs your glasses, it gets hot, it becomes a nuisance after wearing it for a long time; but gosh, it shouldn’t be politicized! For your heath’s sake &amp; that of others, wear it! It may save your life. #WearADamnMask

FAVOR	@MollyJongFast Children are not allowed in school if they have a contagious disease.  Letters are sent home informing parents. Just in case. Asymptomatic covid Could quickly infect the entire school. Then the community. It is foolish to contemplate opening until testing is in place.

FAVOR	@RepDanCrenshaw The countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. The US has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.

FAVOR	When the virus 1st arrived, I heard get a mask. Went to look for 1 and they were nowhere to be found. I got shamed for trying to buy one. Now I've come to the conclusion that the mask is part of the psyop and not really protection. Now I get shamed for not wearing one.

AGAINST	@mamaadams23 @StateHealthIN If your mask works, why does everyone else need to wear one? :woman_facepalming::face_with_rolling_eyes: You need to stay home and hide under your table. Or take a look at the overly inflated graphs that are still dropping despite the fear porn being pushed.

AGAINST	@ClarkeMicah   Great article in the DM this morning. The most realistic and truthful assessment of this ‘mess’ so far. Good job! Masks are unhealthy, unproven &amp; unnecessary. The only reason for masks is to differentiate who is scared witless and who is not. 
FAVOR	@Politics_PR The most interesting thing is how the ones who’ve hollered about the masks being unnecessary and that the virus isn’t real are the ones now getting coronavirus. Know who aren’t getting it? Most people who’ve been wearing masks the whole time.

FAVOR	Don’t be an ignoramous; wear a damn mask.
NONE	Perpetuating the idea that Convid-19 was created by the Chinese government as an act of war, is just as wrong as claiming that millions of Americans will die from the #coronavirus.  Fear mongering on both sides is wrong and should cease.  @RealJamesWoods

AGAINST	@ramcct @JohmBoFlavin @RichardGrenell This is how the #DeepState gets us... they realize that the majority of America, and in this case, the globe, has a short-term memory. Just look up how they literally changed the definition of "Quarantine" to mean "keeping healthy people away from the sick".
FAVOR	@RuekaA @cher I know the literature says children 10 -19 are at most risk. but with this novel virus, everyone is at risk. That's why masks are important for adults. they can't go around spreading this to everyone thinking children are immune. One life is one life too many.
NONE	George Floyd showed the world that Corona virus was a hoax.  He saved all the children in the world.  They can go outside and play and go back to school.  Look at protest rallies how large they are. @cspanwj @realDonaldTrump #TeaParty #breakingnews #breaking #news
FAVOR	This is a wakeup call! Coronavirus can destroy the private education industry that took decades to stand on its feet. If we let it collapse now, it will take decades to build up again.

NONE	I'm watching the #Senate committee questioning #DrFauci and other members of the #CoronavirusTaskForce, and its kind of interesting, in its own way. I like seeing them testify face to face, but the #SocialDistancing adds a little more flavor to the proceedings.

AGAINST	How does #DrFauci know that #socialdistancing stops #coronavirus or any :microbe:? This is first time ever when humans do this experiment. Also how does he know that #StayHome works too? Are there studies say that these methods help to stop pandemics? I hear this for the first time.

FAVOR	When the orangutan in office starts wearing a mask you know shit just got real. #WearAMask

NONE	@Oregonscene95 @WalshFreedom Fact
AGAINST	Fauci the fraud is trending because he's seen sitting in empty MLB bleachers with 2 other people, mask around his chin? #covidiots are out in force today...such a stretch to find something to pin on this #AmericanHero
AGAINST	If you think masks work to protect you from covid (doesn't, says so on the box) then why do you care if I wear one?  If you need to social distance and wear a mask at the airport, then why do u sit right next to someone on the plane and can take the mask off to drink? 
FAVOR	Teachers are taking our  schools to students' homes.
NONE	@WarRoomPandemic @realDonaldTrump The FDA has found hydroxychloroquine to be ineffective for COVID-19. Facts matter @realDonaldTrump

FAVOR	@battletested5 That’s seem to be what many see as the obvious thing to do. Lest we not forget that the moment he does that...access will completely shut down to him. He is not just on the #Coronavirus task force but oversees at @NIH He’s no good to anyone locked out. #DrFauci #RockAndAHardPlace
AGAINST	@brizy83 @ClarkeMicah @Cicero_Speaks @deb_cohen I'm sorry this link is essentially an opinion piece. Read the paper it links to &amp; read the caveats, the paper leans towards high grade masks being useful in medical situations, it adds nothing &amp; provides no evidence for the use of face coverings in public. #KBF
FAVOR	@YourAnonUnit Just wear your mask it's not that hard:heart_eyes_cat:.
FAVOR	Gov. should take a decision for teachers and students of schools Nationwide otherwise their is already too much pressure on them, many kids are so depressed that they are choosing suicide bcoz of this scenario. Gov. Should do something until it becomes so late
FAVOR	@TessEractica @NotSteveOkay @VABVOX @KoriWasinger @ABC I saw that. This is yet another reason why we can't open schools. These anti-mask folks ruin gains made, even work in schools and have kids. No way would I want my kid sitting next to some whacked out anti-mask kid or get an anti-mask teacher.
AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump That is not what they said. And you know that. They want schools to open safely ONLY if the spread of COVID-19 in an area is under CONTROL. But given the GOP and this administration’s completely botched response in handling this pandemic, that will NOT be possible.
NONE	Imagine people saying teachers must not get paid if schools shut down, yet some people get grants just for having babies:put_litter_in_its_place::put_litter_in_its_place: #Angie #COVID19SouthAfrica
NONE	@MedicVet68 Wow. The #TrumpMurder was worse than I thought.  His #TrumpVirus is killing thousands.  He is trying to kill as many as possible with a systematic #TrumpGenocide . How many have to die before he is stopped.
NONE	@JoeBiden This tweet right here is why I would fire
FAVOR	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.
FAVOR	@JeffPassan @markasaxon Gee it's almost as if the MLB's plan to safeguard players, coaches and officials from a highly contagious and deadly virus with no cure isn't actually working. #COVIDIOTS #TrumpVirus #StayAtHome
NONE	Shame on you Dr. Ron Paul-you are a doctor.   A doctor pulling the I’m a”free individual nonsense” that is going to destroy this nation.   “We shouldn’t assume a group of experts know what’s best”- Dr. Ron Paul is honestly the STUPIDEST thing I’ve ever heard. #  #COVID19 #DrFauci

AGAINST	@johncusack @highbrow_nobrow @POTUS Coronavirus. It’s probably coincidence that #DrFauci weeks after downplaying the drugs PROVEN EFFECTIVE that cost $20 and save lives, is now PROMOTING REMDESIVIR. Imagine that.

AGAINST	@KurtSchlichter Fauci: “I don’t see how this is relevant [to the spread of Covid]. I’m not gonna comment on this!” When the head of the Covid task force’s playing political games like a partisan Democrat, you know the country’s in trouble. President Trump thankfully knows he’s a hack.

FAVOR	@Acosta We are worried about kids bringing #coronavirus home to parents, grandparents. How is that point lost at #foxnews? #cnn #msnbc #TheFive #Hannity #coronavirustaskforce #whitehousebriefing #DrFauci #Fauci
AGAINST	As the risk of COVID-19 is getting lower and lower , school should reopen with proper SOPs.
NONE	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits.
AGAINST	Why are @Surgeon_General and #DrFauci both so insistent that masks should be mandated by local and state governments? When did doctors weigh in on federal vs state rights? Do your jobs - report the facts and give medical guidance. Not constitutional law analysis.

NONE	@cspanwj Did the caller suggest that #DrFauci  talked about #hydroxychloriquine  effect on #COVID19 in 2005?
NONE	It is nice to see @lisamurkowski is taking this seriously.  Although she isn't wearing a mask, she's letting her roots be known!    Since she doesn't want to be a Hotspot in Alaska, hopefully she does more than express her concern. #DrFauci #TrumpMeltdown #COVID19

AGAINST	If anyone claimed to be an “expert” on fixing cars and every time they tried to do it the car broke down 5 minutes later, they would be fired.

FAVOR	@JoeBiden Follow your own advice, then. You did an entire press conference with the mask hanging from your ear.
AGAINST	@steveLapointe16 Reality check. Fauci is famous for HIV but never got a cure. Owns 4 patents for HIV research. Has attached HIV to Coronavirus, that's why this can be deadly to a weak Immune system
AGAINST	@simondolan Went in Lidl in Letchworth. I was the only one in there without a mask. At the till, I looked behind me and a woman shopper was waiting. The next time I looked she had removed the mask from across her face to hang of her ear. As I left she had completely removed it.
FAVOR	On the coronavirus I trust the advice of Dr. Fauci over @realDonaldTrump all day long. #COVID19
AGAINST	Thanks for spurring a lockdown that led to millions losing their jobs and govenrment pumping ridiculous amounts of money to the economy.  When we go through our Weimar hyper inflation phase, just remember to thank fauci

FAVOR	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids!
FAVOR	I'm 60 and I wear a mask.  My mom is 89 and she wears a mask.  Don't tell me you are too old to wear a mask.
AGAINST	@CNN And that’s why Fauci is done. He’s Bill Gates’ ventriloquist dummy to push his liability free, unavoidably unsafe, never safety tested, gene manipulating vaccines.
AGAINST	Biden guilting the American people by implying if you don’t wear a mask, you don’t care about people and you’re automatically going to infect everyone is absolutely disgusting.   I didn’t think this guy could go any lower.   #NeverBidenHarris
AGAINST	@DanCrenshawTX Schools need to reopen. The science shows children who do contract Covid do not become ill like adults and they do not pass it.
AGAINST	What's the difference between public schools and daycare?  Teacher Unions.  Get our children back to school!  #notmykid
FAVOR	@donwinslow @PressSec says that the administration won’t let science stand in the way of opening the schools.   This can not stand.
NONE	@NationalForests Was out in Evergreen, CO this past weekend.  Lots of people wearing masks -- some groups didn't seem to be carrying them. Mask people stepped to the side.  Many non-maskers did not alter course.
FAVOR	@ossoff Well, the reopening of schools should go smoothly. I was told that anyone with a fever can return to school 24 hours after it breaks. There’s no testing, not even a doctor’s note required for staff and students to return.   #NotMyKid

FAVOR	It’s sad to be sure but #DrFauci and his excellent explanation of the progression of the #COVID19 infection numbers and impacts, with lag times and “conversion rates” between stages, is the best gut level analog of the #marketing funnel from real world experience.
AGAINST	@PabloDeGrate @TB_Times Can you recruit nations in a class action law suit? If so the teachers should speak to the teachers in Austria, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Israel, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea... all which have opened schools.
FAVOR	When you are sick, listen to what your doctor told you what to do. This nation didn't do it , people are sick, they seek advise from politicians , they listen to dumb leaders, that is why the other country said about us: "most American are stupid" #DrFauci #coronavirus

AGAINST	@sallyKP That is evil. That woman's mask isn't going to do much anyway. Unless she's wearing an N95 or better, what's the point? She's out in public at what seems to be a busy time. Then to say that to kids. Come on! I'm guessing she never got married, and never had kids.

AGAINST	Rumors that long term wear, and continued re-use of the same mask has caused Legionnaires Disease in some cases.
FAVOR	@ASlavitt And yet our #LiarinChief has not met with #DrFauci in 2 months. Instead he sends out the idiot sycophant @PeterNavarro45, who has zero medical training, to try &amp; force @US_FDA to push #Hydroxychloroquine on the public. These people are tryin to kill us.
NONE	@ThomasaMArnold1 Covid-19 is extremely contagious and is projected to cause 300,000 deaths in the U.S. by the end of the year.  So, yes... I am up in arms about that.  Furthermore, Covid-19 is expected to cause even more chronic illness, including chronic heart disease.

FAVOR	@davidnwelton @mkraju @SherrynAdair @SpeakerPelosi It’s time for people to act responsibly. There is enough evidence that masks work. Adults shouldn’t have to be told to wear a mask. It’s not a political statement it’s what makes us all safer.

FAVOR	Kids need to brave the pandemic and return to school ASAP so future Republicans can also have educated people to ignore. #RepublicansAreKillingUs #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica #RepublicansAreTheProblem #COVID19
FAVOR	@markmobility There is no covid surge from any demo. Masks masks masks work.  Wear a mask. Get it on.  #covid19 #getiton 
AGAINST	Whatever happend to Dr. Death Fauci? Hospitals will be overwhelmed! #COVID19 #coronavirus #DrFauci #Plandemic
FAVOR	We have to wait for somebody to actually get the coronavirus in our school for us to close? Shouldn't we be closing the schools to prevent the spread of this?are schools that desperate for money to the point that they will wait for somebody to get infected?
FAVOR	@Pointer77352595 @Mind_Spy This is really funny, ..but it can't be right when that's how 'not wearing a mask' makes you feel.  I dread going into shops now.
FAVOR	Thanks for the great masks, @hvaleche @GreggPbc #MayorDaveKerner #RobertWeinroth #MaryLouBerger @voteMcKinlay #MackBernard. Got mine today. You're saving lives.
NONE	I don't get why the ask us to wash our hands before the clean our school. We deserve a clean school. Start a petition for all I care but keep our school clean because when one of us gets Coronavirus they are gonna get on us for not washing our hands.
FAVOR	@GOPLeader Republicans are refusing to wear masks. Coronavirus doesn’t care about politics, how wealthy you are or who you chose to pray to.  Kev, when are you going to demand that fvckwit in our Oval Office gets off the golf course &amp; comes up with a plan?  #TrumpHasNoPlan
NONE	Many times Twitter doesn't allow you to send love to anti DemocRAT tweets. Twitter really SUCKS! @realDonaldTrump #COVID19 #MAGA #KAG #FakeNewsMedia @FoxNews @CNN
FAVOR	The only constitutional right your mask is violating is your right to get sick and die.  Wear a mask you fucking ape.
FAVOR	@SaraMulcahy1 @SnowinginFL @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Yes, it does, a positive test without symptoms (Asymptomatic) can &amp; has been proven to spread the virus. Thats the importance of wearing  masks, so you dont unknowingly spread the virus. #asymtomatic  #COVID19
FAVOR	Today our school released their “return to learn” plan. The plan is fine, however recent FB postings of school sanctioned activities with no masks &amp; no social distancing makes me pause. I will make whatever sacrifices are necessary for my children to learn from home
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump You know why, stupid? They wear masks, wash their hands, stay 6’ from each other &amp; follow #DrFauci’s suggestions which you don’t.  Tell Americans to do the right thing &amp; schools will have no trouble opening. Pay attention to people smarter than you! There are many!
FAVOR	@CovfefeKatie Katie, This is great if you are gathering info and making a list. If schools don't open parents should pull there kids out of public school and seek a better alternative. #kidsfirst
FAVOR	I have grandparents that have heart defects and lung problems and they can’t risk getting covid-19 because they WILL die from it. We can’t sit here and wait for someone from my brother’s school to get the virus because that puts my grandparents at risk. Please
FAVOR	@DeanObeidallah @TheDeansreport @CNNOpinion Imagine being such a selfish asshole that you place your desire not to wear a mask as more important than a human life.
AGAINST	@thehill Dr Falsi is a fraud and a clown show
AGAINST	@AP He's been wearing a mask for several weeks and it still didn't keep him from getting it. Masks don't work. Plus, he feels fine but still has to self quarantine. WTF?
AGAINST	Well folks, that weirdo #NealCavuto can skip his Viagra tonight. He finally got to see @POTUS wear a mask. The way the media reacts to this proves it’s so much more symbolic than health related. There are some crazy ass lunatics out there. 
FAVOR	@drsimonegold Instead of going on every right wing talk show and pushing dangerous ineffective compounds like some travelling quack, tell the truth.   The best way to deal with Covid-19 isn’t a drug.  It’s not contracting it in the first place.
FAVOR	CSUN, do the right thing and protect your students! What are you waiting for?????? Other Universities are allowing their students to have the option to take classes on line... WHY CAN’T YOU??? @csunorthridge #CSUN;#COVID19;

FAVOR	With a total of 595 deaths in the US yesterday, OVER ONE-THIRD were in Florida! #COVID19 #FloridaCovidEpicenter #TuesdayThoughts
FAVOR	373 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus in the UK and six deaths. The numbers are only expected to rise - surely the safest options would be to temporarily close schools whilst more research is done on COVID-19 ?!
FAVOR	Please tell the government to shut down schools and pay teachers without bringing up the child support grant as if it's not important yona. I don't understand why people always attack people who earn grant, it's for kids, they are innocent they need it.
AGAINST	**I WILL NOT WEAR A MASK**  Masks Deplete Oxygen, Raise Co2 Levels &amp; Destroy The Immune System!  Do Real Research &amp; Be Informed... Not SHEEP To Power Drunk Propagandists &amp; Agenda Driven Fake News Media! They Will Lie For Power &amp; Wealth!  **I WILL NOT DIE FOR AN AGENDA**

NONE	"Lock down for thee, but not for me" Borrowed from the great Tucker Carlson. #COVID19 #Cuomo
AGAINST	@Solution911 Wouldn't a windowless room be a fire hazard, I would be more concerned about that than catching a virus that even if it was there would easily filter through your weak paper mask did they not teach you to not be judgemental of patients? #MentalHealthAwareness
AGAINST	Open #texas #Schools is a must for our kids!!
AGAINST	It’s been four months, my kids have played with their neighborhood friends almost every day- none of us have COVID. Tell me why we can’t open up schools WITHOUT masks and social distancing?
FAVOR	Our three kids are not returning to the physical school until there is a vaccine.  The world needs to adjust, instead of trying to do business as usual. We are following science, not an agenda.  #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Asshole We want Dr.Fauci to provide the covid information. Not some Illiterate moron who will provide bs information.  #COVID19  
AGAINST	@NYGovCuomo This is true which is why Politics shouldn't be involved. Too much govt involvemement destroys everything.  Democrats have totally politicized coronavirus even using students as pawns. All data shows children are not spreaders.
AGAINST	Alcohol was banned with immediate effect because it provides no tenders for creedy comorates, school will proceed due to the fact that they have tenders in schools, ppes, feeding schemes, transportation, etc
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump My 2 teenage sisters, my nephews and many more did not learn one thing since the schools closed here in California. The only 2 children I knew that their teachers actually taught them something was two 7 year olds; one in California and the other in Colombia.
FAVOR	Oh, I can’t tonight. I washing my masks. #SocialDistancing
NONE	Schools are doing their best to ensure that  education for children is not disrupted. I support my children's school and all self financed schools wholeheartedly.

NONE	@va_shiva @MIT He isn’t ready for this type of challenge, he understands the systems approach and fears it because it will collapse his house of cards!  Hold him to the fire @va_shiva

AGAINST	@JoeTowe27804629 @BeverlyZabo @Jack_02_Feehan @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump Democrats are so ignorant. All we do is laugh, just like the mask. Lmao
FAVOR	@GEEPENNIN They brag about being the “pro-life” party yet are doing nothing to protect our children in their own schools, whether it be from this pandemic or from school shootings - their hypocrisy knows no bounds....
AGAINST	@RonMilnerBoodle Oh, that dirty Fraud-ci, his corruption runs DEEP. Follow the $
FAVOR	To #RandPaul @RandPaul: A Kentucky child with #COVID19 is on a ventilator, not that you care. Btw, #DrFauci is to end-all as you are to slime.

AGAINST	You don’t wear a mask out of some noble notion you’re doing your part to save anyone from anything. You wear a mask because they tell you to, and you buy the fear. You’re not a hero out to save the day and we know it. 
AGAINST	@FOX10Phoenix the boys &amp; girls clubs are OPEN for business &amp; the Governor @dougducey can't figure out how to open Schools !!!! Do you see the insanity in your story just now? #OpenArizona

Your charts are beautiful.#MasksSaveLives
FAVOR	@jaketapper Science is NOT on the side of reopening brick and mortar schools!!
NONE	@business Oh I am so excited that our government just purchased the most dangerous/untested vaccines ever made for an epidemic that has been extremely exaggerated while  ignoring the autism epidemic caused by the vaccines they forced on our children. Get your shot of sickness,
FAVOR	It may not be a representative sample, but it was still really gratifying seeing nearly everyone at the @MortonArboretum wearing masks yesterday on the paths.
FAVOR	@suzydymna @realDonaldTrump That’s a laugh. Trump has failed Americans. His incompetence is epic. Failed to act last January when he learned of Covid19. He has no plan for recovery.  145,000 Americans are dead. It took trump 6 months to recommend mask wearing.
FAVOR	#MASA Make America Safe Again! Wear a mask and listen to Anthony Fauci! Oh yeah and #Biden2020
NONE	@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Here’s an idea :bulb:. Stop watching :tv: and tweeting.  How about doing some real work like worrying about the coronavirus pandemic?!?
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump I know you think #DrFauci is on your side, but boy are you ever wrong. You're playing right into his hand. If you continue to listen to his partisan hacks you will not be voted into office again. #ReopenAmericaNow #leadership #COVID19
FAVOR	@DiPasqualeDeb @denisewu @hsbanik @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump But the kicker is that he canceled his convention because of skyrocketing COVID-19 but it is ok to send kids to school :thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:
NONE	If all are adopting  new techniques  of working  than why private schools  can not?   Please think over the resolution made on ' No school No fees'. We teachers  are working  hard beyond our boundaries, leaving all personal family responsibilities to serve kids.
FAVOR	@WhiteHouse If its not safe for his convention its not safe for our children to be in school #TrumpVirus #RNC2020
FAVOR	It’s time for #DrFauci to resign from the #TrumpPressConference and go on his own. He should testify before Congress and hold his own pressers about the #coronavirus Right now he is the most trusted man in the USA. #COVID19 #VoteBlue2020 #Biden #wiunion
NONE	@anubha1812 Regular audit is done by Income Tax Dept and Edu Dept. It is assuming to hear that everyone outside the official system can do a better job. Please don’t speedy falsehoods. 95% of private schools charge less than RS 1000 per month
FAVOR	When in Heaven, a man stood before God and asked, “I put all of my faith in You. Why didn’t You come and save me?”  "God shakes his head. "What did you want from me? I sent doctors to guide you; masks to protect you; and a vaccine to raise your immune system."  #DrFauci

NONE	@stavridisj Shame on an Admiral that’s not honorable to his Country. To purposely mislead should strip him of all medals. #COVID19
AGAINST	First they included BPL students in private schools through RTE. Than they controlled fees through FRC. And now they don't want schools to collect fees and yet give education. What habit and trend are we creating for our future?
FAVOR	TL/DR:  1. Consistent &amp; correct wearing of masks 2. Avoid crowds &amp; keep a distance of 6+ ft  3. Stay away from crowded places 4. Be outdoors rather than indoors 5. Wash your hands. Use sanitizer if you can't wash. #WearAMask

AGAINST	Hell no to your mask mandate  
FAVOR	Schools won't shut down because the government is if certain the problem is with alcohol and cigarettes
FAVOR	3. In many countries these are being handed free out at metros, supermarkets, town halls and doctor's surgeries. Home made ones don't usually clip over the nose so are pretty useless. Why is England so arrogant that it won't learn from other countries? 
NONE	@SteveDeaceShow @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump WTAH, Mr President. #FireJared I’m very sorry he’s your son-in-law.... QUIT LISTENING TO A LIBERAL....

FAVOR	I don’t even HAVE a child, and I understand that is imperative we keep schools closed until it is safe for students, teachera and staff. This shouldn’t be hard to grasp.

NONE	So much for taking a baking class in VT in a couple of weeks. I could choose to quarantine first, but I have to work. Commercial rent forgiveness is not a thing.
AGAINST	@LeahR77 Yeah, no conflict of interest with any of these “health officials”. Nothing to see here people... #FireBirx
AGAINST	@Qpatriotsoldier @GovPritzker This is great video. Last week someone told me this woman has things wrong. I asked her what specifically was wrong. She could not answer. The mask lovers have some psych issue that is driving them to be irrational.

NONE	It would be great if we had a national service requirement and your two-year commitment would be covered (no pun intended) by wearing a mask for eight weeks. #SaveOurBusinesses
AGAINST	@LionelMedia Masks are useful as a sorting tool, the people wear them refuse to research and are of the newly lowered "average" IQ level or below.
AGAINST	@krushowy @TorontoStar Just put chains and chain students to their desks for the whole day. Masks do not work.
AGAINST	@John99601526 @EntheosShines @Drrramina Your argument fails to acknowledge that hypoxia involves the body not getting sufficient levels of oxygen. It does not mean you’ll pass out. What it means is your organs aren’t getting the oxygen they need to function at an optimal level. And that includes your brain.
NONE	If teacher hardwork will not be evaluated than it is not fair ..The schools those you are doing hardwork at this pendemic situation must be supported by the parents and all the govt decision
NONE	@GeraldoRivera You think the virus is bad, wait until that vaccine hits. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #SocialismKills #NoVaccine

AGAINST	@DonFitzgerald1 @fmcoreega @MsResJudicata No. The fiber of the mask has holes that are larger than the virus being carried &amp; do not protect you or others.  The N95 fails to prevent sending virus out or receiving it in.  The mask is an agenda, fear based experiment to find out how quickly people turn to #sheep 
AGAINST	Almost 15 Lakh teachers are unemployed due to closure of schools.
FAVOR	Finally went out after dialing it WAY back after the shutdowns.  I’m very happy to report everyone in sight is wearing a mask, socially distancing and not a single Karen/Kevin. Still a little gun shy about being out, but I am encouraged.
FAVOR	At least this Tweet Storm establishes one thing as a country of parents, teachers we are united that we want our children to learn and have governments not dictating the terms. We trust the schools that we have picked for our children and want them to guide us

FAVOR	The people who refuse to wear masks in public also probably refuse to use toilet seat covers in public restrooms...:man_facepalming_medium-dark_skin_tone: #facemasks #COVID19 #wearamask
AGAINST	@CDCgov needs to answer some questions,  since their "guidelines" are wreaking havoc on our country. Before, Fauci said no need to wear masks before since he "wanted to save them for med staff". Does that mean he no longer cares if med staff have masks? Why not??
FAVOR	@MikeoxlongUSA @10DowningStreet But far fewer, as they tend to adhere to the droplets of moisture in your breath and these get trapped in your mask.  You DO realise the point of a mask is to protect others rather than yourself, don't you?  
NONE	@metrorailgp Let’s stay safe and protect one another   
FAVOR	@CDCDirector @NBCMontana Until the guys standing behind you wear a mask all the time your words are meaningless. @VP @POTUS How hard is it?
NONE	@charliekirk11 @TavorX95 Where is his allegiance?
AGAINST	@CAgovernor @GavinNewsom Stop screwing up our kids over a virus w- 99.9% survival rate!  You are out of your mind! Let's get back to normal asap. Open all schools same as last year.   Covid is a proven NOTHINGBURGER. End of story.  Stop your psychological assault on our children.
FAVOR	Any district that opens up in August for F2F better not ever use the term “data driven” ever again to describe their academic mission statement if they choose to ignore the overwhelming amount of data telling us to stay home. #SchoolReopening #COVID19
AGAINST	Got a #mask today in case someplace gets pushy about wearing one. I may put this on long enough to look ‘em in the eye and that would be it ! #COVID19
FAVOR	@donwinslow I’m a special education teacher and I will probably have to go into school each day, but I will not send in my twin 15 year old daughters. My 78 year old mother lives with us so I will quarantine myself in my room when I get home each day.
NONE	@chrisbergpov By the way the Wuhan Institute of Virology was specifically studying “Bat Coronavirus” The real question is why did he later in Early March decide to Over React and this cause more Cumulative Deaths in US by our Reaction? Again
FAVOR	When my 5 yr old nephew sees a mask in our hands he asks if we're going somewhere, he reminds his big brothers to bring a mask when they leave the house. He's adapted. He was excited to start school this year, but I'd rather homeschool all of them than send them in.
NONE	@IngrahamAngle So what was that Lockdown in March/April/May 2020?  Biden's lockdown?
FAVOR	If @realDonaldTrump wanted an actual campaign manager he would let Dr Fauci mange the Covid-19 outbreak so people weren’t dying as a result of going to work @FauciFan #Fauci #TrumpIsNotWell
FAVOR	People tweeting from their smart phones about how masks are a form of government  control is hilarious to me.
NONE	Problem: Trump did nothing to stop the initial spread of the Coronavirus  Response: It was ______________ fault.  Trump's answers:   China's WHO's Obama's Hillary's Dem's Comey's Dog who ate my Coronavirus response plans  #FireTrump

FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump I assume all of the Sheriffs, who weren’t social distancing or wearing masks, had Covid tests the past two days to confirm multiple negative tests?   As a Republican, I know we can do better Mr. President.
NONE	@realDonaldTrump yes you are murderously sad #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
FAVOR	There are so many cases coming from schools and lots of other people are getting infected do they want us to die school must shutdown now school must shutdown or we are all going to die :sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob:

FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Can America have a "do-over"?  With your handling of this horrid, insurmountable, and climbing loss of Covid-19 lives! Can America have a do-over?
NONE	According to Peter Navarro's "logic" we might as well take paracetamol with our bleach to cure #CORONAVIRUS.... it doesnt hurt so take it.... My God what kind of idiots are in the White House. @JohnBerman @CNNPR @NewDay and btw Peter, the viewers dont listen to you
FAVOR	@HomelessnessSD @victv This is ridiculous. I’m all for religion, just safe from my couch. As a San Diego women who got covid from a restaurant in Carlsbad. (Negative now). Wear a damn mask people, I almost died from this crap!
AGAINST	@GTnate56 Good question.  Perhaps schools will open soon. We must make our voices heard.  It is not the time to be quiet.
FAVOR	Teachers are already underappreciated and paid nothing as it is. Now teachers are expected to fight a deadly disease like #Covid19 ? Teacher lives matter, student lives matter, black student lives matter. All lives matter. Teachers and students are not an experiment
AGAINST	@kylegriffin1 @JuliansRum No need to, Fauci is in Bill Gates/Soros’ pocket. Fauci is a fraud. Trump has other advisors he can rely on for the actual truth of this plandemic.
NONE	Coronavirus has me refreshing Twitter like I'm waiting for a snow day smy

AGAINST	What about the transmission of the #coronavirus by #OralSex or #Intercourse. Why hasn't #DrFauci said anything about that? If it's true then someone should test @BillClinton to see if he is spreading it.
FAVOR	Get use to being uncomfortable, so ADAPT to NEW NORMAL! WEAR THE MASK! 
FAVOR	PSA:   Your mask should cover your nose. Otherwise, it does nothing to protect anyone.  #WearADamnMask #CoverYourFace

NONE	@drsimonegold @maelfyn Covid Is hoax
NONE	Not watching Trumps covid19 briefings he is not a scientist or medical doctor and his lies. Besides its only  a reelection show. He just CAN'T CARE.  Its not part of his make up.  #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	@Hardees it’s a little disheartening that most of your employees in your Athens, Tennessee store were not wearing masks!!! Care more about your customers!!! #StopCovid
AGAINST	@Lrihendry Schools are shut down but teachers still getting paid. No wonder teachers don’t want schools to reopen.
NONE	Please leave the political B/S aside.  If you have kids 6th grade or under would you send them to school? #vote

AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump when will you put real doctors on your task force. Deep state Fauci has it in for you. It's getting late....
FAVOR	I want my kids out of school now. If coronavirus comes into this home it will be through the petri dishes where they spend their daylight hours.
FAVOR	Work from home should really just become the norm this year.  At work people dont wear masks or maintain social distance and the urge to throw a tantrum and swearing at such #COVIDIOTS is making me crazy.
NONE	@Acosta We are NOT in this together. Its us Americans vs you commies.  Fuck off
FAVOR	We still need to engage on the matter of schools We support teachers on this one   #mbali  #TsongaDrive  ##SchoolMustClose
AGAINST	@murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump There is no substitute for human interaction, @murray_nyc    Virtual learning certainly has some benefits, but students are not getting certain things from virtual learning. Combine that with social isolation and the impact that has on kids.
NONE	@JillSaidIt I heard that this weekend. I told them the death certificate can't lie. It may list they died WITH covid, but doesn't say they died OF covid. Not sure I got anywhere, but I tried. #COVIDIOTS
FAVOR	so our school canceled school for a day so we could go support the basketball team, but reinstated it after corona virus concerns??? show me where that makes sense
NONE	I support teachers #Covid_19
FAVOR	I know I have like zero followers, but I had to quit my teaching job today because so many #COVIDIOTS think it’s a hoax and my school is going full steam ahead and opening face to face with NO face masks. I’m devastated. I loved my job.
AGAINST	Please follow @drdavidsamadi.  Let's get him to 100,000!  He is a top doctor standing up to #DrFauci and the lying #Coronavirus fraudsters.  Great follow to hear the medical TRUTH about what is really happening.
FAVOR	@RandPaul just insulted #DrFauci, science, poor parents, and wants to put kids at risk. But I'm sure not his kids. #SenateHearing #coronavirus
FAVOR	People who don’t understand accountability, think they can never do the wrong thing. Be accountable, do right for our kids, teachers and schools
FAVOR	@HaileyHiggins @fox13 We cannot afford another economic shutdown. We cannot put those vulnerable at further risk than we can reasonably mitigate. The simple, inexpensive, and mostly effective solution that can curb the virus spread is wearing a mask in public. Stay open and help the vulnerable. 
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto The Wuhan virus is now weaker than the seasonal flu. There are inexpensive, treatments. A vaccine is only a Big Pharma money maker. Masks are dangerous, they cause health issues. This is America, I don't need or want the Govt to make these decisions for me.
FAVOR	I believe its Gods grace that's being shown through #DrFauci in how to properly approach and flatten this #Pandemic   Minorities, be careful and smart....please:pray:  I don't believe that these rich CEO's care about a human life more than they care about their bottom line. #COVID19

FAVOR	It's not about you, Nichols farm. It's about your disregard for others in the form of not being willing to comply with wearing a mask. It's about protecting the market, the 17 other vendors, and the customers, not about a "personal vendetta".
NONE	@donwinslow #TrumpFailedAmerica  and  the #TrumpVirus  is running rampant through America.
FAVOR	@HonorDecency Locally, the mayor of Tucson, AZ-Regina Romero-She put her foot down and made it mandatory to wear masks in town and closed down business and did not open them again in limited ways early-that' why the numbers are better, here-#SocialDistancing
AGAINST	How are people just cool with politicians mandating unconstitutional mask mandates which is completely not backed up by science?
AGAINST	@rezaaslan This shouldn't be a partisan issue...time to put our kids future first...The flu is far more dangerous to our children than COVID, studies have shown they are minimal spreaders of the virus and the rest of Europe has opened schools with no problems. #flattenthefear
FAVOR	@GavinNewsom pls doing an ad campaign on how to wear your mask properly. So many ppl are not. Especially those making an$ handling our food #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	So let me get this straight: you have to wear a mask or everyone will die unless you’re sitting and eating or protesting, which makes the virus safe? Also, mask= safe, shirt over face=everyone dies? It’s not just that the rules are wrong, they’re arbitrary.
NONE	@WildBil19258248 @JoeBiden Hello Comrade WildBill19258248, how is the weather in Siberia? I hear it is very hot. Has that killed the Coronavirus like Dear Leader  claims?  #TrumpVirus #CoronaDon
FAVOR	10,000 Floridians will die in 2 months from #coronavirus. All because Ron #DeathSantis and the #GOPDeathCult did not want to wear a mask when they came within 6 feet of people in public spaces. #DesantisFailedFlorida #TrumpFailedAmerica. Now they want to kill my kid?
FAVOR	@Rschooley @Souldiva72 Not testing the theory on any child of mine.
FAVOR	The Republicans didn’t care about gun violence in our schools, why would they care about a virus!
AGAINST	2.) wear a mask then insist on one.. it goes on &amp; on.. so why wouldnt his boss @POTUS question his expertise.. he hasnt been right yet.. locking people down for 3 plus months should never happen&amp;that was his brain storm it just goes on.. he is a @BillGates follower&amp;
FAVOR	#COVID19 is the criminal in the shadows holding a gun to your head, Trump is the drunken idiot telling you the gun is empty and Dr. Fauci telling you it’s not worth risking your life. Who’re you gonna listen to? #TrumpFailsAmerica #trumpisafool #WearAMask

FAVOR	@redfreedom2020 @donwinslow Taught 30 years. I can tell you that schools are a Petri dish for germs. Kids don’t follow/understand hygiene standards like adults do, and they constantly touch one another. Normally our bodies fight it off. Not with Covid.
NONE	@RonWyden I'm good with NO further stimulus checks at all. How about we drop the fake plandemic game and #OPENAMERICANOW ? #openoregon  #trump2020
NONE	@uscpsycho But the whole thing is just a Democrat hoax to make that grown man who wears orange make up look bad...  Thr #Marlins are just making this up.

NONE	@LindseyGrahamSC @DanaPerino @FoxNews Fuck you traitor! #LindseyGrahamMustGo #TrumpHasNoCredibility #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	@aging_collins @donwinslow No, its a really simple visual demonstrating that our children and families are at risks. None of the people advocating for schools opening have children who will be impacted by this. Trump, DeVos, Pence...
AGAINST	My morning train to London. Still on about 1/4 full and at least 90% wearing masks.  When are people going to wake up and take back their lives?   #newabnormal #covidhoax
AGAINST	@Beth2002 @KeepAmericaFre4 @ChuckCallesto Let them. I just smile at them and am always polite...drives them even more crazy.   A lot of folks I know admitted they don't believe in the "science", they just wear one because it eases the fear of others. I call BS. Masks perpetuate the fear.
AGAINST	@sallyKP @RealMadDadMAGA I haven’t worn a mask since June aside from at the pharmacy/doctors/Er.  I am immunocompromised w/heart &amp; lung problems so don’t want strep, the flu or anything else.  I am just outside of Seattle under the Inslee Regime.  No one questions me because I act confident.

FAVOR	You won’t wear a mask? If I get it from you, and I pass it on to my elderly mum, you’re a dead man. #COVID19AB  #COVID19
AGAINST	Why is opening schools a political issue now? Families of kids with special needs are really struggling without school or in person services. Zoom makes my son’s sensory issues worse. Do ye want to come over and hold him while he screams? That’s the reality of it.
AGAINST	Just got back from a trip to Lidl and Asda. Number of mask wearers similar to the number of non-mask wearers last week - approx 95%. A little girl was pirouetting and nearly hit my trolley, she smiled at me and said sorry, I smiled back. Fuck your masks. #NoMaskSelfie
AGAINST	Mark my words- FL, AZ, TX are through the worst.  But it's not bc of masks.  It's bc it's been about 4-5 wks.  That's the cycle.  Just like it was in NY.
NONE	CNN has whipped up an army of outraged Twitter Libetards after it slammed a network of local news stations for airing an interview with scientist Dr Judy Mikovits who blames Dr Anthony Fauci for creating the coronavirus and turning it loose worldwide.
FAVOR	#DeadlineWH @JonLemire Nothing #DrFauci said wasn't known by anyone who was paying attention or has intelligence/common sense so he lowkey exposed incompetence/failure of the media to speak truth to power. Trump has gotten away with lying for far too long. #SenateHearing #COVID19

FAVOR	I am so fucking tired of GROWN ADULTS whining and complaining about having to wear a mask in our restaurant. I'm sorry..are you not an ADULT? is it too hard to be a fucking grown up?!
AGAINST	@GovHolcomb Abby's is sweet &amp; Abby's parents are responsible for her. An entire state &amp; the healthy should never be told to mask up for those who may or may not need 2 stay home. Surgical/homemade masks don't stop a virus, never has, never will. Quarantining the healthy is ludicrous.
NONE	@WTNH hahaha.  Per capita NY, NJ and CT boast the highest death rate!
NONE	@CJ_isnowblue Keep him home. No in person school until there's a vaccine. Schools won't let kids attend without vaccinations. Why is this any different? Covid19 can be a lifelong Illness awa deadly Unless you want to risk your families health and lives, keep your children home.
NONE	@RedNationRising @Lrihendry So no MASK or SOCIAL DISTANCING for
AGAINST	@SusanStJames3 He should be fired immediately and arrested for hiding his involvement with HIV coverup in the '80s, the HCQ coverup of his findings of efficacy in '15 &amp; his involvement with Gilead for Remdrsivir and Gates with his vaccine. All of which he got Rich from. #FraudFauci
FAVOR	@DNCWarRoom @IMontoyaResists There is no way my 3 kids are physically going back to school in the Fall. They all want to, but Trump has purposefully bungled our response to Covid so badly schools can't reasonably be made safe right now.
AGAINST	Can we PLEASE STOP making commercials with people wearing %#*’ masks! This NOT NORMAL! It will NEVER BE NORMAL! Quit buying them as accessories! Just STOP IT! #SayNoToMasks #MasksOffAmerica #MasksDontWork
FAVOR	I don't care that I have to go to school, I just prefer not to catch a disease that, even though because I'm a child and the survival rate with #COVID19 with children is high, could be brought home to my house and kill my parents. I know it's unlikely, but still.
FAVOR	@cspan But, #DrFauci is a leader on the #coronavirus task force. @RandPaul. You however, are not.
FAVOR	@CDCDirector @CDCgov Re-opening schools in the middle of a Pandemic is a colossal mistake and you are losing credibility by recommending this. Thousands of kids could get sick badly and Teachers could lose their lives. But you and this administration don't care about American People
AGAINST	Would you go under open heart surgery if your doctor was wearing one of the dirty masks people wear to “protect you from catching Covid19”? #COVID1984

AGAINST	@Daniel40288460 @Lee46587076 @warriorfactor @ACurrentAffair9 ppl with low immunity are dying. They'd likely die of influenza as well. Masks lower ur immunity. U inhale 02 (oxygen) and exhale CO2. What happens to the CO2 around ur mask? U just breathe it back in again increasing ur level of C02. This will lead to more sick ppl!

FAVOR	@TheJordanRachel Your running won’t affect my weight. Your mask wearing will affect my health. If you haven’t figured that out, you’re an idiot. If you have figured it out, you’re incredibly selfish. I run to protect my health. I wear a mask to protect others. Get over yourself.

AGAINST	@BillSchammert The problem buried on this fear mongering whine is that it is based on the assumption that schools are for teachers and staff.  They are not.  Schools are for the students who still need to be educated and need the social interaction and opportunities they provide.

AGAINST	#DrFauci completely contradicts Trump by stating #coronavirus did likely come from a bat, not from a lab as #trump insinuated.
AGAINST	My school shut down denying me access to my professors due to corona virus over exaggeration...... 2-3k$ for this month down the drain :)
FAVOR	@jaygirl1980 So many educational 'categories' of students classified 'special needs.' Vary by state. Learning disabled to multiply 'handicapped' &amp; so much more. Some are more physically vulnerable to COVID. If schools accept some, how to tell parents NO to others? No easy answers.

AGAINST	@UReinke @justjoysworld @AllenGlover53 @Jesus2016comic Well, since it is obvious you haven’t picked up a book in 42 years you should learn a few things about masks and the fact that the #CCPVirus is 125 nm in diameter and the best mask in the world will only filter out something bigger than 300 nm #MasksDontSaveLives

AGAINST	@CathyJoeGPT @chuckwoolery He advised against travel ban from China early. Thank goodness Trump has great instincts.   Says Masks don’t work. Then says wear a mask, Even though it’s a fact that surgical masks (much less cotton covers) don’t block #ChinaVirus - read the warning on the box.

How many fatal underwear-wearing incidents have you heard of? And what does this lady do when it’s her time of the month?
AGAINST	@nicely_nick @LockdownNo I'm not wearing a muzzle. I don't care how much Boris stamps his boots.

FAVOR	Im still waiting to hear a real and truthful example of anyone who’s “medically exempt” from wearing a mask. Like prove me wrong but if ya have a heath condition surely getting the virus is hella worse than being a bit uncomfortable no?
AGAINST	Masks are as well hiding our facial features which otherwise make us recognizable. By making compulsory to wear them along with the social distancing, are they trying to dehumanise and disconnect us? #MaskeyeHayır #NoToMasks 
NONE	Schools are not hotels- pay when u stay. Education makes your kids life.  Fees need to be paid. What about teachers salaries? #CMOGujrat #PMOIndia
FAVOR	#DrFauci believes more than 80,000 have died from #COVID19, at home, in the beginning &amp; were never counted.  This had to be the time period when Trump &amp; his allies were calling it a bad cold and/or a hoax when people were already dying.

NONE	Wear a mask, what more can we ask
FAVOR	Everyday parents choose to send their kids to schools understanding there are risks, be it bulling to shootings. My Sons school was locked down 4 times last year, 3 guns, 1 bomb threat. Schools haven’t been safe for awhile. This is simply one more thing to consider.

AGAINST	@ParrishBrenton Vulnerable stay home, but you don’t make all students suffer for a few.   Under your analogy, then, the 90k who died in 2017 weren’t worth shutting the schools down?  We all know that students are still socializing, protesting and not staying in their homes 24/7.
NONE	@drdavidsamadi How about let’s FUCKING QUIT the LIES about STUPID MASKS and SOCIAL DISTANCING instead?  And fire that weasel!!
AGAINST	@lydbloo @Lordgreyofponty It's had the opposite effect though. Visited 3 towns at the weekend, mask free, and saw few shoppers out and even fewer inside the shops. Ghost town in most apart from the cafes. They seemed to be doing better.
NONE	@drdavidsamadi @Acosta The science is NOT on the side of opening schools. I am so very sick and tired of Republican lies and spin. It’s got NOTHING to do with CNN. Sadly for you, some of us read and interpret for ourselves. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

AGAINST	In the USA, Walmart, Home Depot and other retailers WALK BACK face mask mandates, will now serve mask-less customers. No doubt they were losing substantial revenue. Hopefully the same will happen in the UK.

FAVOR	1/ I’ve got a solution. Why don’t then school districts just give us our summer vacation early. We could end school mid March and resume school in mid June if #coronavirus is contained. The 2019-2020 school year could be finished during what would have been...
NONE	@DrJenGunter Thank you, Dr. Gunter. Also @SuzanneEvans1 haircuts are neither inevitable nor inevitably long. Haircuts are a choice. 
FAVOR	@Canucks Where can we get the Canucks logo masks?
FAVOR	Flock everyone not wearing a mask and not following directives from *real* public health officials.  You're stupid selfish a$sholes.  We're currently on track to  +230K deaths by November. If everyone wore a mask, we are likely to save FORTY THOUSAND lives.
NONE	@piersmorgan the absolute voice of reason. #coronavirus
NONE	@GovernorTomWolf Go away.
FAVOR	@LeChatNoire4 My friend, who is immune compromised, went into a Publix today. Publix stores in FL have a mask mandate. Shoppers wear a mask to get in &amp; then many remove them. She was accosted today by an anti-mask person. I don't know what the answer is but this has to stop.
AGAINST	Well @henrymcmaster you can just have your people fine me $100 cause it is unconstitutional to require masks. #ConstitutionOverCoronavirus #MyChoice

AGAINST	@Gagan2627 Let's be careful what we wish for. If govt schools were working fine, India would not have needed private schools. School owners pay teachers, rentals &amp; other expenses from the fee that parents pay. With FRC, anyways, there is control on fee. What more is needed?
FAVOR	@MuellerSheWrote @jlblueskies Oh please. We all know if he spoke up sooner he would never have been given a platform to tell us Any of the truth. We need #DrFauci and it is a shame he has been sidelined so this fraudulent administration can continue to manipulate truths. #COVID19 is beyond politics.
AGAINST	We will surely save our schools.
FAVOR	I will always trust Fauci and will never trust @realDonaldTrump. tRump is a mob boss and the biggest liar ever. I'd be surprised if Fauci ever purposely and knowingly lied. In this country it's not the #ChinaVirus it's the #TrumpVirus.

FAVOR	Anti-maskers are 100% that person you went to high school with who never left your hometown and spends their weekends day-drinking at water parks. #maskdebate #WearAMask
AGAINST	Schools have to open back up. I understand parents who are concerned, but please, understand the children for whom it’s the only place where they can get a warm meal, for whom it’s a place that keeps them off the streets. Schools offer more than books and tests.
AGAINST	@SenKamalaHarris School closings affect poor &amp; POC who can’t afford private schools, tutors &amp; daycare. If you care about education you should demand that schools open or give vouchers for daycare, tutors or private schools. Not all kids learn online not all parents can help.

NONE	Lack of testing is a huge Trump failure!!! #VoteOutHate and ignorance.
FAVOR	@hartfordcourant Reopening schools in a few weeks... will teachers be eligible for workers’ comp when COVID infects us? I’m heading back in a few weeks with protections like “recommended distancing when possible”. Who will sub for sick teachers? This is crazy. #NotMyKid

FAVOR	@NBCLA Im scared to go to school #LAUSD needs to stop being money greedy they aren’t thinking of those kids who have low immune system and who can easily catch the #coronavirus and spread it
AGAINST	Watching people ride bikes, drive cars or jogging with masks on is nothing more than a statement to a person’s loyalty to the “state” - for those on the left too dim witted to know what that means - to the government and bureaucrat edicts.  #covidsheep 
FAVOR	As the virus continues to spread uncontrollably, nearly half the riders in my #metra car today don't have masks. Mandates from the govt and promises from the agency do no good if conductors don't remind riders that masks are required and hand them out as needed.
FAVOR	Covid-19 cases rise so highly meanwhile the people awareness of Covid-19 has been rapidly going down at the low level. Whenever I went outside, I saw most people didn't wear mask. That also indicate how people stupidity is rapidly going up at the high level

NONE	Ok...so...Did I hear #DrFauci correctly??  They started developing a vaccine for #COVID19 IN JANUARY?? :face_with_raised_eyebrow: @realDonaldTrump Why was a vaccine in development if the #coronavirus was "a hoax" and if it was "going to disappear??! :rage:
NONE	Save schools, Save the future... #SaveOurSchools
FAVOR	@RichieMcGinniss @JackPosobiec Look at how young they all are.  No wonder they don’t want schools to reopen.  These kids would have to be in class. @realDonaldTrump   Also, I don’t think this is 6’ social distancing.  Anyone got CV #s in this city?
AGAINST	@d_mos77 @AldiUK It won't be easy but it's possible! It's hard when the local shop insist on masks and debit cards too!.... They're anti business!  555

AGAINST	@DeniseMarlaine In fact, is there any sheriff anywhere who will enforce mask "mandates"?  How could they?  They enforce actual legislation, not dictators' tantrums.  
NONE	@MBOKSR_MAGA @IminHisbook @realDonaldTrump Haven't you noticed? He keeps them around long enough to ruin them. He's about done w/ #DrFauci. So you'smd rather have @JoeBiden? I'd rethink that strategy.  #COVID19 #CoronaVirus  #Trump #KAG #WWG1WGA

AGAINST	@TweetingFingers @VictoriaPolice You are a very obedient comrade.  Congratulations.  You have been conditioned well.  To raise your social credit score even further, I encourage you to conduct nightly mask patrols and send reports about your neighbors' mask conduct.
FAVOR	Just went to the gas station. The only person other than me wearing a mask was the cashier who was actually in a booth behind glass. I don't get it. The indifference is startling here.
FAVOR	@Daniel_Lewis3 You’ve got to tip your hat out to #DrFauci and #DeborahBirx for enduring #POTUS nonsense. They’re true heroes for thinking about the #American people. They’re guiding us through the #COVID19 CRISIS
NONE	Not collecting fees would make it impossible for schools to continue their essential operations such as digital education delivery, maintaining buildings and infrastructure, increasing sanitation measures. Schools need fees to pay for resources

NONE	I thought the we were talking about the people with regards to the coronavirus nonsene #TheDeceived
FAVOR	Oh, it’s going to be “a safe reopening of the schools.”   We can all stop worrying. Donald Trump says it will be safe, so it will be safe because he says so. When has he ever been wrong before?  What is his strategy? That it will be safe. Simple.    #TrumpsAmerica

FAVOR	@SamCoatesSky You are Not allowed into the UK Disney stores without a face mask as it’s company policy, they had someone on the door handing out masks to those without one. As a young person I am happy to wear a mask during this time and hope it becomes compulsory in shops. 
AGAINST	#DrFauci is hilarious!!! :smile:  At a hearing, with no one next to him, wearing a mask.  Takes the mask off....puts it back on...takes it off again.  Folds the mask up...puts it on the table.  Touches his face continuously!  ...but I should take it seriously.
AGAINST	Why anyone sticks up for dr. Fraudci is beyond me. I dont trust a damn thing that little weasel says . Hes just trying to keep everyone scared so he can make millions off the vaccine. He becomes irreverent once this is over
FAVOR	@tirghrathoir @ResisterSis20 This guy is a pastor?  No church I want to ever go to. He’s a fucking moron. Suggestion: If he or any member of his family EVER needs surgery, the surgeon, anesthetist, nurses, ...should NOT WEAR MASKS!  No way in hell Jesus will let this guy in. #COVIDIOTS

NONE	@MatthiasRex999 @CNN They just need to remember - when  they say these things about the Administration’s #coronavirus response...they are including #DrFauci &amp; #DrBirx in these smears. And the media will have no problem stepping on or over them to report anything that criticizes #Trump.

AGAINST	@Traderlebowski @katrinagulliver @BenAltitude @JoeSilverman7 Dude, how do teachers get paid?  Here is a clue,  property taxes.  Teachers are no better than nurses,  doctors,  police,  cashiers,  bank tellers,  and so on. Teachers needs to get back to work. Wear a damn mask.
NONE	Teachers put in a lot of effort; during classes, students listen to the teacher and it's a good mode of education in the current scenario. How do we expect schools to pay them without any fees.
NONE	Trump and the GOP know they're on their way out of power. They're running the COVID-19 response into the ground so Biden's term will be mired in the chaos of 2nd and 3rd waves of the pandemic. Their anti-science politics are indistinguishable from mass murder.

NONE	@realDonaldTrump on #FoxNews “It’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right . . . You know why? Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else.”  Same logic with a broken clock-it’s right 2x a day but it’s still very wrong! #Gaslighter #Lies #coronavirus
AGAINST	@javadisciple @supitsshekinah This is why I don’t wear it. If I was told “we aren’t sure about the total effectiveness, but it will cut down on spread, and we are asking you to make a sacrifice and wear a mask” I’d be all for it. But no one is leveling with others like free adults so
NONE	The world is flat, dinosaurs never  existed and ‘science should not stand in the way’ of schools reopening.

The one who on Feb 26 called travel restrictions "irrelevant", the one in March who minimized the #pandemic on CNBC or the one who mocked the usage of masks on 60 minutes saying they don't do anything. Sounds like the dude never left the 80's  
FAVOR	Thank you #DrFauci  We all wonder why there isn't a #StayAtHomeOrder for all of the United States #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic
AGAINST	@amymiller Yes. But, in February I found a Chanel lipstick color that is literally to die for. Literaly. Therefore, I will not ware a mask. Perfect color and sheen - so, FU. I would gladly die to wear my lipstick.
NONE	@TheSolariReport Oh btw, Gov. Lee, just mandated masks in Nashville. Vague, and how are they going to enforce with a flyer that explains. He caved to dem Health Dept.  Judy Mikovits, PHD in virology, would be laughing.

AGAINST	@Birdle_2963 @yogagenie Ask AIDS patients from the 80s how they like dear old Dr Fauci
FAVOR	@Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse Dr. Fauci deserves nothing but respect. Will there come a day when Trump actually starts putting American lives above his own personal ambitions? Start listening to people who actually know what they are doing? It never had to be this bad.  #TrumpVirusCoverup

FAVOR	Everyone is so "Pro-Life" until parents just want to keep their child(ren) safe during a pandemic and government officials demand we re-open schools. Tell me, is it a "return to normalcy" when their classmates start dying?

NONE	@EMichaelJones1 It's my opinion he woke up his own viruses by wearing a mask, and he got a fever to try and kill it off. I don't know how old he is, but if he gets the annual vax and got run down with the mask. It's all keeping it going, and going,  on and on until they find out
FAVOR	#Fauci if we're not to gather in large groups, why are schools still open? If we can't do same things as months ago, why are we endangering our kids still? #coronavirus #COVID19
AGAINST	Anyone opposing the shut down of schools is crook.
FAVOR	For those so “pro-life” you want me to sacrifice my children and myself (teacher) for “normalcy”. Funny how the D’s are accused of making masks political, while Trump &amp; ilk sacrificed 100k Americans &amp; are now coming for the children to win an election/raise economy!
NONE	Let us not forget the CDC has quietly listed the COVID-19 mortality rate as .4% and we're being forced back into our homes because of a "2nd wave".   #Plandemic2020

NONE	@NeilClark66 Gosh Neil it’s very depressing reading these comments. They seem unintelligent &amp; vindictive in equal measures.
NONE	@1972patriot @TommyBattle It’s also about keeping schools closed so the economy can’t fully recover  When/if schools ever open again, they’ll place ridiculous demands on students &amp; teachers alike &amp; that’ll put a tremendous strain on the system that can never be met  #Shamdemic
AGAINST	I’m guessing now that after the riots with their mass gatherings are over it signals that the coronavirus lockdown has ended and everyone is going back to work? #COVID19  #DrFauci  #COVID  #California
FAVOR	Watching press conference on #COVID19 with @POTUS. It appears he is more interested in reporters being #nice and brown-nosing than offering #hope or #truth to the public. Only trust #DrFauci.
FAVOR	@marcorubio There is no absolute here.  Kids need schooling which is education, not "need to go back to school" which is a place.  The cost of life outweighs the cost of being at a place every time. Stop word-smithing your way around an issue that could kill thousands.  
AGAINST	@jejquade @HealingWarrior1 @EmmaRoulstone Masks have been mandatory since May in Spain, infections are up,local lockdowns enforced. Follow that logic.  Muslim women wear full face coverings in public.The Muslim community are still suffering the greatest rate of infections in the UK   Follow that logic

AGAINST	#DrFauci should be FIRED! He used bad models to engage in fear-mongering &amp; hysteria. Now he's saying @realDonaldTrump to blame for needless U.S. deaths because he didn't shutdown country MONTH earlier. Yet in Jan &amp; Feb #Fauci said #COVID19 was NO PROBLEM. Fraud! #MAGA #FireFauci
AGAINST	Anyone else find it suspect that Walmart sold masks and then announced they were requiring "facial coverings". Now my local store isn't selling them. Extra money for Walmart by preying on your media-induced fear. They knew masks didn't work, but they took your money.

FAVOR	Until we move from “me” to “we”, COVID isn’t going anywhere and is only going to get worse

FAVOR	@MichaelArt123 I prefer people representing our country that believe in science.  If you’re not wearing a mask, you don’t believe in science.   I suppose stopping at a red light, wearing a seatbelt,  and wearing clothes in public is stifling your liberties too.

AGAINST	#DrFauci the "certain populations" narrative surrounding #covid19 is very disconcerting.  How many of that population are we willing to let die for the greater good?
NONE	@KarluskaP 7 Apr 2020 Tuesday news briefing #DrBrix at 1:39:25  “Some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death. “The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19 we are counting that,”  #DrFauci Tries to clean.
NONE	@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery It's amazing how @realDonaldTrump says he didn't rape anyone but won't give his DNA to exonerate himself.  It's amazing how Trump said he would release his tax returns but hasn't. Even more amazing are the @GOP #cowards letting him get away with it.

AGAINST	@xoKaylaNicole @QANONRealNews The fact that you have a health issue that should legitimately keep you from wearing a mask, yet you will go so far as to judge one's Christianity for not wearing one seems odd to me - like your brain is turned off and you can't think for yourself.  
FAVOR	@AvantiWestCoast I’m in coach F en route to London Euston from Sandwell &amp; Dudley and two people opposite me do not have a facemask on? What is the process as I feel that it is irresponsible and also they’re not following the strict guidelines like others. #covid19
NONE	@SteveMa35404308 @AndreasPrucha @BuckleBD @ProjectLincoln @finnie_me Omg you just said your wife has been battling cancer and that you won’t wear a mask? That’s so irresponsible. My oncologist has been clear about being careful. I pray for her living with such an idiot #WearYourDamnMask #ScienceMatters
FAVOR	So @realDonaldTrump and @vp have decided to wind down  the coronavirus task force.  Makes sense.  The press conferences have been a disaster as Trump hijacked them, and he can't control #DrFauci , he can control the head of @HHSGov.  Trump doesn't want accurate info out there.
FAVOR	@Acosta @PressSec  1. Read real science. 2. &amp; other countries can reopen schools because THEY did the hard work: shutdowns, masks, tests, tracing &amp; isolating. We didn't. 3. Look at Israel. They are closing up schools now.  Children over Trump's campaign, please.
FAVOR	First #DonaldTrump wouldn’t let #AnthonyFauci testify before #Congress bc #DrFauci was ‘too busy.’ Now, he will let him testify, but not before the ‘Dem. House.’ What doesn’t he want you to know? #MAGA, #KAG2020, when will you wake up &amp; see how #Trump has failed? #coronavirus

FAVOR	@JoeBiden So again, you're going to ignore what's happening in Portland, OR how unauthorized Federal agents are abducting citizens and detaining them without cause? Or are we supposed to also forget that you are in favor of opening schools back up? #PortlandUnderSiege
FAVOR	@julieasmyle @ChimerReilly @GovWhitmer They all had masks on. I don't like they weren't distanced, but every single one wore masks, unlike the ignorant a**es who whine because they are asked to think of others.  Make me.  Haha. #RIPJohnLewis #HeWasLoved
NONE	Stop this ridiculous, completely unfouned #COVID19 BS!  There is NOTHING suggesting a 2nd wave.  We have all we need to know.  The data shows the elderly and immunocompromised need to be careful.  Everyone else, full steam ahead.  Do not give in the lies. #CovidGate
FAVOR	@MeredthSalenger These #KarensGoneWild are part of the reason #COVID19 keeps getting worse, spreading more &amp; not slowing down! She thinks she’s had it with the stupid, huh? I have bad news for all who think like her.....they’re the stupid! #WearADamnMask #BeBetter #KindnessMatters

FAVOR	"You don't make the timeline. The virus makes the time line." - Dr. Anthony Fauci  If only our president would listen to #DrFauci, the immunologist he selected to serve on the #COVID19 task force. He doesn't listen because he cares more about reelection than saving lives.
AGAINST	@2DBeachGirl @ksbw Yes it is, that was over the 4th of July weekend when they shut the beach down &amp; the "so-called manditory" masks signs went up hence WHY I took the picture! It's sad &amp; a joke even after ALL the #truedata they still can't pull their heads out of their asses!

NONE	@HansMahncke Wonder where he was/is getting his information from? :thinking_face:
NONE	@BetsyDeVosED keep fighting for the kids. Chris Wallace was unhinged and emotionally illogical in your interview with him.
FAVOR	By not quitting and remaining in #Trump's crap Admin, #DrFauci has become irrelevant. Why is he allowing himself and his brilliant career to be ridiculed by Trump on a daily basis?  If he quits, he becomes the unfiltered voice of #Covid19, speaks without fear, and exposes Trump!

FAVOR	I challenge @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @BetsyDeVosED  to attend schools 5 days a week, 7 hrs a day when schools reopen. Come on in, sit in a desk, use the kids' restrooms, navigate the crowded halls, ride the bus, sit in the cafeteria if it's so safe.

AGAINST	@CDCemergency When will you and the @WHO stop pandering to the political conspiracy about masks.  Your misguided information to the general public should be seen as nothing less than criminal!  This has never been about the virus - it's always been about control.  #NoMaskMandates
AGAINST	@AngelaTeague12 @KTULNews Considering the younger population is much less impacted by the virus, there really isn’t a reason to keep schools closed. Plus, a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics encourages “having students physically present in school.”
FAVOR	I am sick to my stomach over the thought that there are districts informing #teachers to update their wills and having both children and teachers sign waivers over dying. We are not at a point of safety to open schools properly.
FAVOR	The WH found their scapegoat because trump failed in preventing the spread of #Covid19, &amp; 137,000 people died, &amp; the economy collapsed!  
FAVOR	You know the best solution if public school systems refuse to close down, to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for every parent and child call in sick.  Even if your child is not sick, someone will be if schools remain open during this pandemic.
AGAINST	Masks aren’t required. Follow OUR @realDonaldTrump guide and let “then” box themselves in. Ask me about not wearing a mask and I’ll ask you about HIPAA violations, ask me about my kids not wearing masks and I’ll ask you about child abuse and mental abuse. #MAGA2020

FAVOR	@NBCNews Every time #DrFauci says what the public is thinking and agreeing with, puts him that much closer to being shown the door by #Trump. If Trump fires Dr Fauci, I hope there is a public outcry of EPIC proportions. Truth to power, Dr Fauci! #TruthMatters #COVID19
FAVOR	@Patriotize Yep masks only worn in the O.R. and infection contagion risk areas of high risk patients. And they were not these cheap ass blue and white paper masks they were N95 respirator masks. :pray::flag_for_United_States::heart::frog:

AGAINST	Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker as well as Massachusetts State Democrats are trying to get Fed funding for daycare. Now if they can open daycares they surely can open schools. I believe coronavirus doesn't discriminate between toddlers n school-age children.
NONE	@Thomas1774Paine This guy has been breathing his own CO2 for too long.

AGAINST	@CNNPolitics Fauci is a fraud. He said coronavirus was nothing to worry about. Then said masks are harmful. Then said masks should be mandatory. Then said everything needs to be shut down. He also gave money to the Wuhan lab that released the virus.    #FireFauci
AGAINST	They didn't close the schools when the Swine Flu was going around, so they shouldn't close the schools for Coronavirus! If I didn't get time off school because some people had a cough, then neither should they!

AGAINST	@Chase2929 @Kevin_Shipp I am saddened by the Christian's promoting the mask charade. I refuse to give in!
NONE	School is said to be our 2 home. If home needs to maintained than even schools need maintenance. No fees is no solution.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov They will@make sure that schools do not open and also make sure there is a second wave. Unless you stop this madness, the economy will falter again and you will not win the election. ACT NOW! #sheeple

NONE	@BelkissObadia Except that mask is on the wrong person.
FAVOR	Yesterday the #LAPD gave out 300 masks in Hollywood. I am embarrassed to live in this City, a place where infections, hospitalizations &amp; deaths continue to rise &amp; 300 people felt that it was ok to leave home without a masks. It’s the City of idiots not ANGELES.
FAVOR	@iheartmindy That’s because you’re a Karen and a trump lover. If you really cared for the people that deserve to live on this planet. You would wear a damn mask. Good luck for when you might need a ventilator soon. Us Normal people are going to wear masks to survive.

AGAINST	We aren't against teachers we are just against this system. Just think, education that is a base of the future of an individual is fully dependant on apps. Ans for that schools are taking fees and  teachers aren't paid if they are unable to teach online.

FAVOR	@AprilDRyan I have no children but am friends with numerous teachers and librarians. Although they desperately want to return to schools, they don't think returning now will do anyone ANY favors. They are also outraged that the fed did NOTHING to stop or plan for this.
FAVOR	Gawd, @CNBC dissing Fauci really?  Let me guess, Bannon is on later telling us it's all a hoax. Just talk about stocks and leave the conspiracy theories to Fox.
FAVOR	Quoting Sadhguru, edited for this context - "No one is expecting Online Education to be perfect, but Schools are constantly striving to be better; in the best way possible under these circumstances to bridge the GAP in learning. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS."
FAVOR	@IAmHighOnHeels Watch till the end and #mask up everyone!   #MaskUpCanada #Masks

AGAINST	@DanaPerino Fauci should not dictate shutdown length! After 9/11, we reminded not to overreact by saying, “Don’t let the terrorists win.” Nnow, by slamming the brakes on daily life, our actions are letting the coronavirus win.

AGAINST	@Manny_Alicandro We all must be unmasked.
AGAINST	Next time someone tells you to wear a mask, just respond with a confident "No." It's working. Stores are already realizing they can't enforce this. Politicians may not give up, but we can make their mask orders irrelevant. #NoMasks   Post your refusal story at

FAVOR	@kromagin @cbigg81 @DinosaurJaime @OliviaNiland People on the side of keeping kids out of school for another year are harming children far, far more than opening schools would regarding this virus.  I’m beginning to think those teachers don’t really like teaching and shouldn’t be teaching.

FAVOR	@ChrisWickNews A virus is much smaller than shown.  How-ev-er, a virus needs water to survive. The virus rides on airbourne water mist from a cough. Each drop is about 150 to 800 microns.   It would not pass through the mesh of the mask, no matter how dense your intelligence.

FAVOR	@DrsuzanneH You see it's because of populistic morons like yourself that we have trouble getting this virus under control!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	Just back from the High St. Refused to wear a mask. Turned away from shops, as were many others. People walking around like dehumanised zombies.  Just as the High St was getting back, this nonsensical mandatory mask policy will finish it off.  #NoMasks
NONE	@MikeHolden42 @JesseRodriguez @DafnaLinzer Just sad. Be safe
AGAINST	Ekalavya gave his thumb to learn from his guru. That is the value our culture places on education, in whichever form it comes. Please allow schools to continue and do not take this away from our children. @vijayrupanibjp
NONE	@realDonaldTrump Fauci is openly contradicting you.
AGAINST	Only 3 people inside a packed Home Depot without masks on and two of them were my husband and me. No Karens reared their ugly heads but I was fully prepared for it. Not today, satan. #StandYourGround
AGAINST	@BenIrvineAuthor I’m with you on that. I though Boris was a level headed politician, I’m starting to question that.  If you’re more comfortable wearing a mask for protection, then fien, wear one, but don’t force me to wear one too.  Masks only work if the person wearing it is ill.  
NONE	@GovNedLamont Since Lamont can't make up his own mind about almost everything, I hope Fauci doesn't tell him to shut the state down again (Because Lamont isn't a REAL leader and he'll probably do it).
AGAINST	I am in the airport wearing a clear face shield. It is the closest I will come to wearing a mask and only because I need to fly. My :red_heart_selector: breaks looking at these sheeple in their masks. It is so sad to not see smiles &amp; expressions!:cry:

FAVOR	@PTI_News The Schools n colleges should be closed pan India,  for at least a fortnight owing to the threat of coronavirus. Else We would be putting a lot lives under threat. Do not want an Italy like response #COVID19india
AGAINST	@lorraine @JohnBarrowman @ThePaulaWilcox @itvcorrie Well you really sold your soul to the devil #Barrowman. Not only are you a Scot who fakes an American accent, you're now telling people who don't wear masks that WE'RE selfish and are stopping you getting back to normal :joy: News flash THERE IS NO NORMAL.

FAVOR	@W7VOA @GOPconvention Children over age 10 have been shown to transmit the virus at the same rate as adults.   There are a whole lot of kids age 10-18 that are going to carry the disease all through their schools and out into the communities. #GOPDeathCult
FAVOR	@TrumpWarRoom @weijia Not the science is in the way to reopen: the virus is! Very little evidence &amp; data because kids are not tested that much! They get infected or are asymptomatic carriers. In EU: small groups, alternated classes, masks &amp; washing hands, not before September 1.
NONE	@FoxNewsSunday  Chris Wallace said Trump predicted a possible vaccine for C-19 by January, but what he did not say is that  #DrFauci said the same thing in the recent update.  Chris Wallace on a campaign to destroy Trump! #FakeNews
AGAINST	.@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump .@VP .@Mike_Pence I love how you’re getting these 2 on the record sir. That’s right...put them through the gauntlet and make them ANSWER QUESTIONS. Because you’ll need these sound bites from #DrFauci &amp; #DrBirx.:wink:  #COVID19 #CoronaVirusTaskForceBriefing

AGAINST	@koa_zar @ezrateach @Rasmussen_Poll Once the actual numbers of corona virus deaths are released, there will be an uproar! We the people have been lied to from day one about this virus. Fake numbers on deaths and infection rates. #Plandemic
AGAINST	It’s so great to know that all the rich Tory politicians can shield their elderly &amp; at risk loved ones while the rest of us, who can’t afford to stay at home, can just fuck off &amp; die :hugging_face: #Covid_19 #COVID_19uk #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
FAVOR	@CMag051 It’s very scary to see how many people aren’t wearing masks or social distancing. We all need to do our part. It’s not that hard.

NONE	Torn between using scamdemic or election infection....
FAVOR	@RunByClowns @Revegelance @luvadergolder @mark_dowling @NeilClark66 @freddie801 Relative risk management. Masks required now. Do the decent thing and wear one. It’s no big deal really, I have to wear one every day at work, and it helps protect the most vulnerable from covid19
NONE	@Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse Step up Mike, before your fuhrer kills all of us. Surely your god tells you to do the right thing. Don't be a lemming. Allegiance to a delusional dictator is not admirable.  #GOP #COVID19 #coronavirus #REALITY #trump #Pence 
FAVOR	#Coronavirus why are people acting shocked or stunned that #DrFauci is being openly attacked and demeaned by @potus or #FOXNEWS   It was always going to end that way. No one is ever allowed to tell the Emperor that he has no clothes.

NONE	@DoroLef Absolutely!
NONE	@Melissa20753729 Working in the Healthcare field I know many clinicians who had the #COVID19 virus with little or no specific symptoms. I don’t know anyone personally who has passed. I guess that’s a good thing. #HerdImmunity
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump The RNC is moving Trump Convention to outdoor space because of COVID but R’s want kids in schools!  #Covidiots #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
FAVOR	Am I the only one that heard during #taskforcebriefing that schools could hold outdoor classes?  This would never work in Indiana where I live.  Below freezing temperatures would not be ideal learning conditions.  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
AGAINST	It’s amazing how many people just roll over and wear masks despite a preponderance of evidence that they dont help nor are they even necessary
FAVOR	France: 15-day lockdown Spain and Italy: indefinite lockdown Germany and Canada: closed borders EU: about to ban all travel for 30 days  ...UK: hmm, well, yeah, could you please like try and not spread coronavirus guys x  #CoronavirusOutbreak #SchoolClosure
AGAINST	@BiscAnenome @SikeNawGaming @BardsFM Weird how many doctors say masks aren't the answer except in situations like surgery to avoid coughing or sneezing into an open incision.   Masks don't block viruses anyway.  Our health is damaged if we restrict our breathing. Our immune system too.   Goodbye.  
FAVOR	i have the option to do online or in class and you already know i’m sure as hell not going back so i can avoid everyone’s annoying asses
FAVOR	@mikemcmannmd @AllieGatorFL @Tips89_ @GovRonDeSantis @BrowardHealth You understand that he literally altered scientific data to help @realDonaldTrump right!?  And he won’t issue a mask mandate
AGAINST	I got yelled yesterday by some male version of Karen for not wearing mask at the vegetable store . Poor soul was triggered by it and probably had his vagina inflamed for seeing me without mask.

AGAINST	@thejuliaeffect @realDonaldTrump Monday, April 13, 2020 Throwing Trump under the bus: Dr. Anthony Fauci Tells Al Sharpton He Warned Trump Admin in Mid to Late January “We Were in Real Trouble”from Coronavirus....His subsequent quotes on 2/29 &amp; 3/09 should disqualify him as an expert.
NONE	@Liz_Wheeler How fast can he pack?

NONE	@mchooyah Just fucking perfect. #RulesForTheeNotForMe @POTUS

FAVOR	@debragarrett @realDonaldTrump If you think #DrFauci is “deep state,” you’re an idiot. You’re probably one of the a-holes applauding his death threats.  Please tweet from your hospital bed, when need a ventilator but can’t get one, because you’re in a “beautiful red state” that you think is immune to #COVID19.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom  WE WANT OUR SCHOOLS OPEN THIS FALL GOV. NEWSOM!  STOP PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES, THE GIG IS UP DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS! CORRUPT DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE WALKING OFF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECAUSE OF DEMOCRAT PARTY SHENANIGANS!

FAVOR	@SenCoryGardner How about you protect #DrFauci too! since you like to toot your horn about how much the science community loves you, do them a solid and stand up to #COVIDIOT Chump and stand up for #FauciIsAHero
FAVOR	@therecount Sending children to school during a deadly #COVID19 pandemic, is worse than putting your children in cars without seatbelts.  It's playing Russian Roulette with the lives of children.   It's child abuse.   #StayHome
FAVOR	Time to turn off @cnn &amp; @msnbc for the @realDonaldTrump #misinformation show. I listen to everything that  #AndrewCuomo &amp; #DrFauci say, they are the real #Leaders of this #Covid19   #Pandemic. Why don’t we have #MassTesting? #Trump &amp; cronies want it that way. @whpresscorps #Lies
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump You and your task force are a disgrace. The Navajo Nation has more deaths from COVID-19 than 13 states combined!   We need Dr. Fauci. Not you. We need a real national response that looks after everyone!
NONE	@CDCgov stands for 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'.WTH would anyone trust information about #COVID19 from ANYONE else?!This is 1 more step towards totalitarian rule!Fake numbers r going to be seen now. V are going to see 'reduction of #COVID19 cases"
FAVOR	Kids go to school so they can learn, not so you can work. Not so they can die. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
AGAINST	Ok, I’ve just gotta say it...MASKS SHOULD NOT BE FASHION STATEMENTS! If you want to wear one, that’s fine w/me but the thought that people are making &amp; buying pattered masks is actually terrifying. Wake up and think! Wake up and fight!!! #saynotomasks #MasksOffAmerica 
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump @THeer1990 If Fraud Fauci was fired and real Doctors were advising the country, we could take off these ridiculous masks, get back to work and school. We want our freedom back!!

AGAINST	If masks work, then why are people working from home? 
FAVOR	I knew my procrastination would pay off! #COVID19 will hopefully delay my A Levels
AGAINST	A call out to all you Lone Ranger mask wearers. I think you've missed the memo where it states that masks are a one use wear. Not something you stick in your pocket or bag between shops or until your next shopping trip.
FAVOR	Teachers will die if schools reopen too soon! Goodnight. #ReOpenOurSchools #SchoolReopening
AGAINST	WA St’s gov  has issued a mandate that we have to be masked -I wish he added costumes. If I have to see the world walk by me in masks &amp; social distance, I would like the world to walk by me in costume w| their character’s signature walk. I think the world needs that. 
AGAINST	You survived attending public school without wearing a mask.  Your child will too.  #NoMasks

FAVOR	@chavezlinda @7eleven Why do all these middle finger pointing, non mask wearing, cough in the face people always look rabid???  #COVID19
NONE	@WhiteHouse STFU! How many more people have to die before someone in this administration does something useful? A national mask mandate would do it but...that would mean you’d have to have a backbone and stand up to the blubbery buffoon!
NONE	When asked about a possible cure for the #COVIDー19 pandemic, #DrFauci said that antibody testing will be available “very soon”. This leads many Americans to ask how soon is “soon” and when will life begin to resume from where it stopped. #CoronavirusUSA #BeatingCorona #DrFauci
AGAINST	@Bluesman6178 @GovPritzker Too late! Had dinner in Chicago last week. No mask even to walk in! Was disgusted getting served by woman with dirty little germ infested face rag on her face that she kept pulling up and down off her mouth and/or nose Ewwww! Take those rags off your face people!
FAVOR	@TeaPainUSA @Bevfriesen1 Well, @realDonaldTrump:clown_face:, I totally disagree with about everything you say each time you ‘reopen’ your lying mouth. Whenever #DrFauci opens his mouth, he tells #Americans the #truth &amp; the #facts about #Covid19. So, do #America a favor, #Trump: “Shut your trap!”  #TrumpLiesKillUS
AGAINST	19 people without masks today in my local Tesco! Can guarantee the mandatory mask wearing will not work for very long. Asked one of the cashiers and she said they can’t question it and can’t police it themselves! :grin::grin::mask::mask::sheep::sheep: #NoMask

FAVOR	if you don't stand with Fauci, you'll fall for every lie Trump's tells about coronavirus.
AGAINST	@DoctorYasmin @NBCDFW Children rarely get serious COVID-19 disease.  At least 40% of urban children not signing into online schools. Can't have another year of no education, increasing childhood illiteracy, depression and suicide.

NONE	We need to have faith in our schools! Not all schools are running after money. My school is passionate about working for the best interest of children. I stand for my school.
NONE	@ChrisCuomo I saw that Speaker Pelosi referred to COVID-19 as the “Trump Virus”. From where I sit, and considering the lack of action, I actually term it more as the Trumpdemic! #Trumpdemic #LetsGetAfterIt
FAVOR	Do ppl understand why insecure #QuackTrump Mr. Not-A-Dr. doesn't let actual #DrFauci opine at #TrumpPressBriefing? "I'm not a Dr. but I have common sense" his standard #TrumpKnowsMoreThan statement - Generals, Drs.... what next, tell us buy a voodoo doll? #CoronavirusUSA
FAVOR	So the EU bans non essential travel, closes bars, restaurants, schools and half of them on lockdown. The UK are just going about our business waiting for the inevitable. We will end up in the shit. #covidー19uk  #coronapocolypse  #COVID19

FAVOR	@funder @lcookwike 1/2 The train has all but completely gone off the tracks!

FAVOR	If someone refuses to wear a mask on a plane, why not remove them during takeoff?
FAVOR	What's more important? A students education? Or the wellness of the student and staff? Closing schools for a day may work for bad weather, but not for the coronavirus. Districts all around need to open their eyes and realize one day closures do nothing to help!

NONE	As part of his argument to relax restrictions on social distancing, #DonaldTrump stated that the #USA is starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. Would #DrFauci please advise the #President that the light he sees is a train barreling down on him...the #COVID19 EXPRESS!

AGAINST	@ZacBissonnette That video, my god. I'm as progressive as the next person and I dearly hope Trump will lose, but I can't remember the last time I watched such a cynical, fear-mongering piece of propaganda. Keeping schools closed will be devastating for our most vulnerable children.

NONE	The very same leaners are going around the streets and our communities without Masks. I just came back from the shop's and no-one is wearing a mask in my community. Government must just make the  unemployed youth  ambassadors for Covid-19.
NONE	@Alyssa_Milano This from the President of the International Victimhood Association.  According to JHU today, the #CCPVirus survival rate is 96% &amp; that number has been trending upwards for the past 2 weeks.  Positive cases ≠ increased deaths!
NONE	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light
FAVOR	My first online class was over Skype and the first 30mins was watching a classmate document himself cooking eggs. All in all a 10/10 experience #coronavirus #StayAtHome

FAVOR	Is it lost on anyone that the exact same people who bitch and moan and refuse to where a mask to save another human life are the EXACT SAME people who doggedly defend the 2nd amendment after 50 people get shot dead by an AK-47? #therightiswrong #COVIDー19
FAVOR	Now Cohen is getting released. Just so we keep the record straight I’d like to remind everyone Covid-19 has made prisons so dangerous that Manafort, Stone, and Cohen are not incarcerated. Meanwhile President Ding Dong is lobbying for kids to be in school.
AGAINST	so let me get this straight  #DrFauci told us masks dont work.  #DrFauci told us masks do work.  #DrFraudFauci admitted he is a liar.  Dr. Fauci can kick rocks.

NONE	Dr Fauci today in the committee hearing warns against reopening to early but he also said there is guarantee that a vaccine will work so that leads to the question what do we do then? #DrFauci #CDC #COVID19 #Covid_19
FAVOR	@CDCgov @CDCemergency 2. We aren't thinking of safety.  This is a direct email from my kid's middle school,  my kid has asthma, is not allowed to take precautions, and will receive no aid if (when ) your child comes into contact with a #COVID19
FAVOR	I try to be unbiased on my Twitter.  Which is why I’m saying Wear A Mask.  Because wearing a mask isn’t political or partisan. It’s common sense and kind to your fellow human.  We all have to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.  
FAVOR	Grown ass people are constantly throwing temper tantrums over wearing a mask to grocery shop for 30 mins, but kids, especially non neurotypical kids, can absolutely wear a mask for 7 hours a day to go back to school while the politician's kids stay home.
NONE	@JustMEtillDeath @Francis_Joseph Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought

AGAINST	@MtnMD @laurajo82878461 @FreeThinkMind @DrKellyVictory @kksheld @drdavidsamadi People who make kids wear masks while their immune system develops will be responsible for many many illnesses and deaths later. It’s child abuse.

AGAINST	Do not make masks mandatory @BorisJohnson.  It is a foolish, fear mongering destructive decision.  
AGAINST	@StephenNolan Think @DrChrisSmith just blew away the whole #facemask argument by stating it's based on "slim evidence". So @SadiqKhan and @BorisJohnson has made this draconian law on flawed medical proof.

FAVOR	Can #DrFauci or #DeborahBirx tell #DonaldTrump that sniffles are not a symptom of #Coronavirus. People with allergies, like me, don't want people thinking it is a symptom. I mean, how can he not know the symptoms?
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn Hey Republicans and other #trumpanzees If you do as that orange fool in the WH tells you about #Covid_19 you will die. You are letting that fool lead you to an early grave. Now, if that’s ok with you, then go right ahead. But you dummies won’t take me with you.

AGAINST	@DrTessaT He’s a squirrelly little man who needs to make his mark in life.
AGAINST	@PlanetFitness I can’t describe how disappointed I am in your company. To require masks even for those with health issues is insane. To not allow us to cancel our membership without penalty is practically criminal. #ShameOnYou

AGAINST	@DaiDavi32130352 @modernwoman13 Seriously though, like wearing a mask for their dear life whilst filling up the trolley with coke cola, cake, crisps and biscuits. It’s not that that’s my business but the irony of wearing a mask.  I’ll sick with blueberries, satsumas and cherries
NONE	Anyone else think minds will clarify and focus regarding #COVID19 when Sept. rolls around and there’s no #football?  #MondayMotivaton

FAVOR	@nycjim @PressSec Science is based on FACTS  Not Figures Not Corporations  Not Political Agendas  And not for negligent, corrupt criminals who want to jumpstart economy to work their campaigns.  Schools should be closed until there is a vaccine.  This is Our Children  Not Products.
NONE	Education is a fundamental right &amp; not a subject of votebank. Parents&amp;schools should stay united &amp; stop getting influencEd by political dramas. Its my choice to select  best for my child.  Every good thing comes with a cost &amp; if I want best I  should pay for it
FAVOR	Shopping at @WinCoFoods  Me to "lady": If you're not gonna wear a mask, please don't stand next to me or my kid.  Her maga mask half ass wearing husband: ShE hAs A illnEsS, diCk!  Me: Then wear a fucking mask, idiot!  Him: FuCk YoU, cOmMuNiSt cUnT!  Awful humans.

FAVOR	How we handle COVID-19 requires facts. Science. Medical expertise. Experience. Not political influence.  That person is Dr. Fauci.

NONE	MILLENNIAL WILL COME TO #CORONAVIRUS THIS WEEK...OVER... Will Schumer and McConnell be any more witnesses to shake Reid's hand?
FAVOR	I can tell u for free, @MYANC have so many tenders linked to schools, closing schools will mean closing thier Pockets, They rather see teachers and children with chronic illness dying of Covid-19 than losing thier bite on the 500 billion relief package.

AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump Fauci is literally killing people by hindering ability to access HCQ. Lockdown ruined lives, depression huge problem. Looks bad you keep him on.  Why ????
AGAINST	#DrFauci lied about needing masks early on because he wanted medical workers to have supplies. Has anyone asked him how many citizens died because he made them feel masks weren't necessary?   #COVIDー19 #MaskUp morons #Scamdemic #FakeNews #FakeNumbers #Qanon #WWG1WGA

AGAINST	@chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump PLEASE expose #firefauci Birx and CDC !  The truth about this Virus needs to be told.  They’re all #DeepState .  WE know they’re hiding behind “scientist” cover!  Why not private sector Dr’s speak at a presser?!  And
FAVOR	It's clear the gotcha police were in out in full force Why does everyone hate masks? Why do they show no remorse?  The fact that hes being vilified is crazy, he certainly isn't a witch The worst thing he's ever done was try and throw a pitch! #Fauci #FauciFirstPitch
AGAINST	@drdavidsamadi I think Trump is still keeping Fauci because he know Fauci is behind the virus and if he fire him, Fauci could easily spread another one which is cooking in Chyna right now, which could be really deadly?
NONE	As the mainstream media also continues to side-step this issue, one has to understand that this is not just about helping private schools owners.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump Fauci is [DS] Fake... He contributed to this in 2005...

AGAINST	Notice 2 things in this exchange: 1) Predictibly, Rand Paul is the only Senator willing to represent the truth on this issue without pulling punches 2) Fauci is an extremely effective and manipulative speaker. No wonder he keeps convincing @realDonaldTrump #coronavirus
FAVOR	I support online #school for my children as that is the new normal in the current turbulent times. Don’t try to ruin schools and education
FAVOR	@PBS1982 @vividchi1 @Letrangerdalger @Revilopsa Your use of ‘Dr Fartzy’ speaks volumes about you.  Doctors and nurses survive long shifts in serious medical masks.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump your own expert just testified that we did not lockdown beyond 50% and THAT is why we have more cases! why can you not get a handle on this?!

NONE	The fact that the market rose today in the middle of a pandemic with no vaccine 25% of the population unemployed with more shut downs ahead may indicate to some socialists that this may not be the indicator of economic well being we should rely on.
NONE	Okay here’s the plan, I found out you can get paid $1100 to test the first potential coronavirus vaccine. So who’s finna take one for the team?:eyes:
FAVOR	As a teacher i really dont like the fact that parliament is closed and we are expected to go to school and  be exposed to dangers of covid-19 everyday. This is like sending your chicken to the dogs, while u watch the show and relax:lying_face::lying_face:
AGAINST	@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Shannon, why do you and others in the media sound so excited about a vaccine for covid-19 coming soon. Don’t you know that there are many people that do not want it? #BillGates
AGAINST	@JNostrabor @ifindkarma @CookKCEgyptian @COVKIDProject He had a mask on in the middle of the baseball field with hardly anybody around him. Why? For show. #bye
NONE	nearly 400 people in the uk have coronavirus - guaranteed to jump well over 400 after today - and the government still wants to stay in the contain phase instead of delay phase. mf u failed containing it just move on and
NONE	@Phreadys No not at all.
FAVOR	In case anyone is wondering my children will not be attending public schools in the fall. #COVID19 #schoolviolence #sexualharassment #SystemicRacism  #bullying #TeachersLivesMatter #SocialInjustice need more reasons? #backtoschool
AGAINST	@DrRobDavidson @dbongino And yet another Dr on the list of physicians who would never be allowed to care for me or one of my family members. Shockingly dumb. #NoMasks
NONE	Virtual classes cannot replace physical schools but it does solve the purpose of engaging with students,its only alternative to continue with learning despite the lockdown.
FAVOR	as someone who is autoimmune, i do NOT want to be catching coronavirus... but of course the schools don't care about it :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
FAVOR	@marcorubio If you weren't so weak, you would be slamming your own @GOP, @VP, &amp; @realDonaldTrump for their response. You would also stand up for the CDC, FAUCI, WHO, instead of a draft-dodging real estate salesman. #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirusCoverup #COVID19 #GOPBetrayedAmerica
AGAINST	#keepyourchildhome... why? Unless they have a pre-existing condition (MOST understandable), their mortality rate rounds down to ZERO %.   "Oh, but they could become carriers!" Then... wear your mask, right? Social distance, right?   I smell BS.
AGAINST	I'm just a girl standing in a shop with no mask on asking people not to judge. :thumbsup: #bekind
FAVOR	@RforRingmaster @ananavarro Where I live if you serve someone without a mask the business can be fined $9000 for each occurrence. So your $7 coffee &amp; donut do not compensate the business for the risk of that loss.
FAVOR	#DonaldTrump is horrible at handling th his #pandemic . It is truly our governors who are keeping us safe. He wants us to take unapproved meds &amp; go back to meeting each others in stores and restaurants as thousands die a week. #fail #COVID2019 #COVID2019 #coronavirus #DrFauci
FAVOR	You know the whole point of a mask mandate is to WEAR the mask? NOT put it on your ear and let it hang or leave it by your water bottle or not wear it at all.
FAVOR	@JoeBiden What happens when we win the election and President Biden enacts a national mask mandate?  "Karens" will be coming out of the woodwork and it aint gonna be pretty.   How can we make this happen NOW?   #YesWeCanAgain #Biden2020Landslide
NONE	@GeoffRBennett @DafnaLinzer @SenToomey @RepSmucker @SenBobCasey @SenatorAument @GovernorTomWolf @JohnFetterman Help protect us! We need more testing, more quarantines and more leadership! SOS #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdate #CDC
NONE	So far, I've gone into Walmart, Home Depot, Winco foods and Fred Meyer without a mask. They have not refused service and nobody's got in my face about it. Every time I go in, I see more and more people not wearing the face diapers.  #NoMask #Plandemic
FAVOR	His voice and leadership are necessary to combat the coronavirus and #CoronaDon.
AGAINST	@RudyGiuliani Wait wtf? :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::joy:  Fauci has to go.
FAVOR	Riddle me this...the government has been so hell bent on vaccinations not allowing kids to attend school until they’re updated..we don’t even have a fucking vaccine for COVID so why does this moron and his negligent administration want to reopen schools??
NONE	How was Beijing and most of China spared from the British :crown: Corona  virus? The Pilgrim Society and Bill Gates go hand in hand just like the #CDC...mmmmmm
NONE	@geekwitglasses_ Masks are proven to NOT WORK!
AGAINST	@vintage_cams @Msdesignerlady @mmpadellan Exactly! This Fauci dik created and attempted to monopolize a vaccine, then went public with a false rhetoric that aids/hiv would infect at least 10% of the heterosexual population... it never went above 4%, but this dik lied repeatedly to sell more product...
AGAINST	@cjtruth @JoeSkucinski5 Apologies are NOT ENOUGH :::: END THE HOAX :::: #CovidHoax
NONE	The push to forcibly mask the general public did not come from health professionals. It came from lobbyists "persuading" politicians. I suspect there was probably some money on the table as well. #MaskOff
NONE	(2/2),more people dying from the lockdown than the virus itself, long-term severely mentally damaged + fearful adults and children from the measures imposed. However, please carry on as usual, nothing to see here.
FAVOR	We've either had huge numbers cured of whatever illness that prevented them from wearing masks or the stick is working.  Very noticeable increase in compliance this morning in Limerick.  
FAVOR	@DCHokiefan @Nationals Notice that he was invited as an honored guest while #TrumpVirus is rage tweeting and eating hamburders.
NONE	.@DallasISDMedia NO IN PERSON SCHOOL @ least through Labor Day. New info tomorrow. #COVID19
FAVOR	The realization of how many think we're nvincible to #COVID19 was never more apparent until we saw people actually walk into the funeral home with no mask defying our state order. You're literally standing with the dead all around you and you still don't get it.
FAVOR	I join AmerAssocImmunol saying “Scientific &amp; public health experts, including the trusted Dr. Fauci, are vital to combating COVID-19 &amp; safely reopening the US. It’s important for all Americans to stand strongly behind them &amp; take their advice.” #FollowTheScience
FAVOR	The Devil went down to Georgia and they called him Brian Kemp He refused to order mask wearing, saying all are exempt If you live your life mask-free instead You might end up the next one dead How do I stay alive you ask Use common sense &amp; Wear the Damn Mask! #COVID19
FAVOR	All the rich people events are cancelling for #COVID19 like @Harvard, @MIT and Ivy League Basketball but all the public sector stuff stays open until it's bad news bears. @Google, @Microsoft, @Walmart, and @McDonalds have all closed down or offered paid leave.
FAVOR	@piersmorgan Not enough I fear.  Gov prefers to be reactive, rather than proactive Now COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic I think we should close the schools to help slow the spread of infection. We’re in a better position to do it than other countries. So we should do so.
NONE	@TimNoEgo That sucks; but 65 is still alive. Enjoy what we have and resist that tangerine tinted dumpster fire!
FAVOR	@WalshFreedom There is always a scapegoat for #TrumpFailure - #DrFauci should tweet his resignation before Trump firetweets him. #TrumpPandemic
NONE	@DeAnna4Congress Smarter and honest too.
FAVOR	More good news: 75% of healthy 45-53 yr old patients that recovered from Covid have permanent structural damage to their hearts = to a heart attack.  But masks are hot.
AGAINST	@mmpadellan I The Devil, stand with Fauci, only a lunatic and a pack of thieving liars wouldn’t! We had a small pox outbreak in Hell about 10 years ago, worst in a century. A little mask wearing and social distancing cleared it right up.
FAVOR	@BillKristol Dear #DrFauci, I do not doubt your expertise or concern for the nation. However, this “president” is going to destroy you and your reputation before this is over. It’s what he does best. We need the truth. #COVID19
AGAINST	Schools need to go back! Keeping them closed causes parents to stay away from work to homeschool their kids. It holds back the entire economy, and by the way, kids don't die from this disease!
FAVOR	@NahasNewman Thank you for this!As a teacher, I have been looking at a little of this data, but I haven't seen this much all together.The schools here are planning on opening in some capacity and this data helps me with any fears I might have had.I'll definitely be passing it on
FAVOR	If you're not willing to wear a mask at a grocery store (even when it's mandatory), could you at least utilize their delivery or pickup options (which is often free)? You are gaining nothing. Does the thrill of walking down the cereal really mean that much to you?
FAVOR	@kazweida :thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup:thks @WeAreSinclair #Plandemic  #BoycottSinclair  #AdvertisersTakeNotice #ComcastComplicit #BoycottSinclairAffiliates #IBelieveFauci #ISupportFauci
FAVOR	@thehill We aren’t in the clear. This will not “magically disappear.” Science is our arsenal, Fauci is our Patton.  The premature drive for normalcy-to send children to school-will be an historic, irresponsible strategy. Not until there is a vaccine are we safe.
AGAINST	Global pandemic.  Democrats.  “Quick put a old t-shirt over your face. That will save you!” #COVIDIOTS #COVIDー19
FAVOR	If my ass has fucking asthma and if some dumb bitch in my school gets the corona virus and I end up getting it I’m gonna end up fucking dying
AGAINST	@NYGovCuomo They’re really fooled when they even get their kids to do it. People don’t seem to be catching on so I’ll say it again. Masks DON’T work. Show me the evidence (not just someone with a few letters after their name on TV saying “wear a mask”) #WakeUpAmerica 
NONE	@thehill Neh, Stalin killed more.

AGAINST	Just popped to a couple of local shops so showed them the respect of wearing a muzzle for the first time.  It was really horrible and didn’t take long before I was feeling short of breath. How have you lot been putting up with this? #masks
FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Fickster69 @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd No... You're not a "bad person" necessarily... you're just... obviously... tragically... not too smart. Too easily larped. This isn't D&amp;D... a spell won't save you. Herman Cain didn't wear a mask, and now he's dead. Don't be like #HermanCain.
FAVOR	It’s the medical professions message.  Not the presidents message.    @WhiteHouse The truth doesn’t care who tells it!    I want to hear from Dr. Fauci #DrFauci #COVID19 #MondayMotivation #WearAMask #mondaythoughts #coronavirus
FAVOR	@Placed2nd @AngelaBelcamino Omg people say I have to wear a mask and I'm crying because I have to wear a mask to save lives boo hoo!! MAGAts are stupid!!!
NONE	what forced government to take this step? 1.schools even after pay cut to teachers, not even talking about cut in fees 2.expenses like electricity,stationary,contact pays are saved and benefit not transferred to students.
AGAINST	@JoeBiden No we aren’t, many children are being left behind by closed schools
FAVOR	@RandPaul such a lack of respect for #DrFauci. He is a respected scientist and physician. We need his skills. We have lost 80, 000 Americans. #COVID19
NONE	New title Maskhole. I think I'm going to use this very soon. #coronavirus
NONE	@realDonaldTrump 146,632 deaths. 4,197,184  cases. Covid growing exponentially. Only 15.2% tested. STILL NO PLAN. 43 million unemployed. US soldiers being murdered by Russia @realdonaldtrump @gop @vp @whitehouse @lindseygrahamsc FAILED AMERICA   #trumpownseverydeath #trumpgenocide
AGAINST	@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit Does Fauci know what it's like to be without a paycheck? To have a business go bankrupt? To wonder where your next meal will come from! Let's hope he'll find out soon!
NONE	@doublebtx @Jared_Carrabis Jesus it's worse than the fucking flu. People need to get that through their goddamn heads. and you don't 'survive' or 'recover' from it. There's long term lung, heart, brain, muscle etc. issues. We barely know what this virus is capable of. #ShutItDown
AGAINST	@LaraCrabb "little wet men mincing along" perfect analogy of the mask gimp.
NONE	@JulieCllloyd Nope, I will not be going to Vegas when it opens up. That's a long way to go to contract #COVID19 and hand over my cash to a slot machine. #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe #FlattenTheCurve
AGAINST	To anyone who needs to hear this.   Rosa Parks would've refused the mask.
AGAINST	@RudyGiuliani Terrible man!!! #FireFauci
FAVOR	@CDCgov We should all be terrified that @realDonaldTrump is blocking @CDCgov from testifying on reopening schools. He’s sacrificing the lives of kids, teachers &amp; school staff &amp; he doesn’t want us to know. This. Is. Happening.
NONE	@realDonaldTrump Daffy Donald doesn’t know that the stock market is NOT the economy! He’s owned by Russia!! #TrumpVirusDeathToll158K #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasNoCredibilty #VoteForOurLives #RepublicansForBiden

FAVOR	@SRuhle just now a horrible story abt 82 kids contracting #COVID__19 at camp, despite all the precautions and being sent back home to 10 dif states, weaponising children to spread #COVID__19 , go ahead open schools

FAVOR	@APCentralRegion @AP What a #COVIDIOT. #MaskUpMichigan #maskup
AGAINST	@RandPaul thank you for being rational and figuring for the people.  #DrFauci  is a #snakeinthegrass and so is the #media  #thegreatpanic of #covid19 is beyond our of control.  #get rid of fauci and #ReopenAmericaNow   The people are waking up and seeing the #socialist movement.
AGAINST	@simondolan I’d love to go for a look round the shops and actually need clothes but I won’t go. The thought of that face mask and orders about sanitizer &amp; what direction to walk in puts me right off. Also not allowed to try anything on :woman_shrugging_selector: #KBF
AGAINST	Defund Teachers if you don't reopen schools.  #ReOpenSchools
FAVOR	Every non-masker should have to go to the bedside of someone in their community dying of Covid-19 and explain to them why they think it’s ok to not wear masks. #WearAMask #WearMasks #WearAMaskSaveALife
FAVOR	@DrEricDing I flew a few days ago. It was made crystal clear masks are be worn AT ALL TIMES in airport and on plane. Before we boarded @SouthwestAir nicely announced 'don't even think about not complying or you won't be flying'. To have the privelage to fly we must comply.
AGAINST	@Lawakenings @QTEAM1776 I LOVE that none of them are wearing masks! The masks are nonsense! Mind control!
AGAINST	Closing the schools will not stop the spread of coronavirus. Everyone will get it at some point, but only few will die from it.
FAVOR	@Mike_Pence @VP @UofSC Yet, 85 infants have been diagnosed with covid!! You think school kids are gonna keep their masks on all day? Wash their hands every single time they need to? Not scream, yell, sing, spit on another kid or school staff?! Wake the hell up!!! #pencemakesnosense
AGAINST	@dahboo7 And I can’t figure out why the govt wants everyone in masks of all things they could mandate? Why masks? Just to watch sheep follow fear and obey? There must be a reason. And Disney mandates 2 yr old and up to wear masks? There will be dead children! I don’t get it.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @CNN No testing. No tracing. No back to schools!
NONE	@SandraManning16 @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump Oh, no.  It’s not. Hydroxychloroquine doesn’t work.
NONE	Coronavirus pandemic is in full effect... #Quarantine #CDC #DrFauci
FAVOR	So private schools are taking decisions to close. Not public schools? Viruses don’t discriminate. Viruses don’t care about your bank balance. Viruses don’t care if you went to Hillsong conference, or the football or to school. #COVID2019 #COVID19Aus #coronavirus
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump “This guy Fauci, I’ve had about enough of this guy,” Sethi said at a Saturday rally to loud applause from the crowd. “I think maybe it’s time for the president to bring him into the board room and say, ‘You’re fired.’”
FAVOR	@Super76x Thank goodness! Protect your babies at all costs Chris. You cannot rely on this administration and the #COVIDIOTS to make decisions! I stand behind you and all parents 100% :punch:
AGAINST	But I don’t get it. Why?? Why is everybody behind the pillar of civilisation?  Is the ripple effect not visible? Schools collapsing will result in the entire nation’s collapse!
AGAINST	@MBOKSR_MAGA Masks haven't done shit Abbott have you investigated the fake inflated numbers? #ReopenAllOfTX
NONE	@AAnnven @Sky03413577 @rob_miller12345 CV-19 is a military code name for the hoax operation still in progress. #FakePandemic #Event201 tells you this was all a #Plandemic We MUST resist.
AGAINST	@MikeRobbins19 @ClarkeMicah FBPE, climate alarmist AND mask-truther.  You too could hold the same beliefs as Zorro here provided you consume copious amounts of MSM propaganda.  #CovidHoax
AGAINST	WHY did fauci on 60 min say Masks should not be worn by healthy people? And today he never mentions his HYPOCRISY :joy:
FAVOR	@Bill_Maxwell_ Still :100: x better than #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
FAVOR	Sickening to hear that @BorisJohnson and @Conservatives are putting staff and students at risk by not closing schools. It is clear that you care more about money than you do the people #coronavirus
FAVOR	The Stubbornness from the @DBE_SA is out of this world...scientific evidence is there, Covid-19 is on its peak now, they waiting for those graves to be filled first then act?
AGAINST	@CoinAgnostic I'm not a fan of #DrFauci. He really failed AIDS victims when he was Reagan's point man on HIV who moved very slowly against it; some AIDS activists at the time even accused him of mass murder. Now he seems to be bending the stick the other way with #COVID19. Wrong both times.
NONE	@thehill @SenRonJohnson that $600 a month is going back into the economy ~ the millions being gifted to big business with no oversight is the problem.                        45 needs to get his head out of his ass &amp; realize #COVID19 isn’t going away until it’s spread can be stopped
AGAINST	@piersmorgan I don’t know, you should check what they actually died from. As per #DrFauci and #DrBrix even if you die from a trip and fall but you test positive for the virus it’s a #COVID19 death! Why are they lying????
FAVOR	@RightWingWatch I wonder what his take would be on “No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service” #Masks
NONE	@GeraldL_Ibe @Alyssafarah @realDonaldTrump Navarro reflects my opinion.
FAVOR	@PeterNavarro45 is a fringe economist. He has no medical training... no infectious disease expertise. He hasn't served six GOP &amp; Dem. presidents to keep Americans safe. Navarro pushed hydroxychloroquine, criticized shelter at home orders, and covers for Trump.
FAVOR	C’mon Governors!  Don’t let DJT dictate and threaten you! Get your heads together and refuse to open schools at this time.  What? Is he going to cut off school funding to half the country? That is not how one wins an election!
AGAINST	Since teachers are afraid to reopen schools for the fear of catching Covid, then maybe we should just bring the classroom to Walmart since most of them probably have no problem going in there.
NONE	@CONCERTCHIC @livefreepatriot @moxie_mo24 Don’t worry. You won’t be bullied into summering the #BlackLivesMatter movement.   #8645eleventhree20 #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
FAVOR	Theoretically, you could be walking around with coronavirus for 2 weeks without knowing   And I go to an American school, also known as a PIGSTY  So before all 135,000 students get the coronavirus  Why don’t we just
AGAINST	@Syoungjba @GFL9112 Agreed. I'm not going to accept a forced muzzle.  #NoMasks  
AGAINST	@Tepid_Safu @rgwarner @MayorofLondon Nope. I’m afraid they don’t.  *The virus is tiny and easily gets through a cloth or paper mask.  *they give false sense of security &amp;minimise hand washing *they prompt face touching *they are frequently worn incorrectly * they are a litter and infection hazard.
AGAINST	When the stupid Plandemic is over just remember all those businesses that acted like Communist China and denied you service for not wearing a mask. Remember those brainwashed mask wearing idiots who gave you a dirty look. They showed their true colors! #Plandemic

I’d rather listen to medical specialists- WHO, CDC than the quack Immanuel spouting about dream sex with demons causing Covid. Viruses don’t have a political agenda?
AGAINST	Woolworths were trying to make me wear a mask. What happened to our free country. Give me freedom or give me death  #QAnons
FAVOR	@jessiehellmann @SenWarren More testing ,More cases.These numbers are there in January itself. We need data on Asymptomatic / symptomatic for those who tested positive in June. Do not make people panic .Wear masks, maintain social distance and sanitize your hands please #DrFauci @WhiteHouse
FAVOR	Who did America call during the  AIDS, EBOLA, and now the CORONAVIRUS crisis? Pence?No Trump?No America called a caring physician and scientist who has dedicated his life to medicine and science. Don’t let the diminutive haters talk shit about him. It is evil.
FAVOR	@gtconway3d Lol.  His expertise is bending a curve not throwing one...  The fact that these juvenile jackasses would even try to denigrate a scientist over a bad pitch just proves that they deserve eradication just as much as COVID-19...  #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	We understand you are upset. But #DrFauci and #DrBirx have years of experience helping people like you survive. This disease is killing people worldwide. Listen and grow up. #Coronavirus #COVID19 #Pandemic
FAVOR	The next fucking asshole that tells me there is no data that kids can transmit COVID-19 to others is gonna get dick punched.  Kids haven't been in school and why in the fuck would we want to experiment on our children for the data you assholes require. Go To Hell
NONE	Only a week ago I still believed COVID-19 is just another flu-like infection and people should stop panicking just because it's in the news. Each day I realise more that this was only a tactic to keep people calm, which I agree is important. Now stop wasting time
FAVOR	@AnaCabrera Why can’t people follow rules and wear a darn mask?! #MaskUp
AGAINST	Sheeple are so focused on the sins of the past they don’t see what’s happening. Modern day slavery should be the issue cause it exists. Through sex trafficking, child trafficking &amp; now MASKS. Masks hurt more than help. They are just a sign of submission.
NONE	@Phreadys NOT AT ALL!
AGAINST	ONLY sick people need a mask. Wake up Americans
AGAINST	:thinking_face:I think #LawAndOrderNow in the nation pretty well surpasses #DrFauci #COVID19.  I don't know why Trump hasn't directed a stronger response to the #protests--now a FRONT for #DomesticTerrorism.  But if I agree Trump hasn't led well here...just imagine #SleepyJoeBiden as POTUS:bangbang:
NONE	Not a good day today!  UP Cabinet Minister succumbs to COVID-19. Union Home Minister tests positive. Tamil Nadu Governor tests positive. UP BJP President tests positive.  #StayHomeStaySafe
FAVOR	@cleverkate I have been wondering what is the right approach. By saying nothing you are in turn approving a behavior. I was @Costco and a mom w/ a child and husband (both w/ masks on) wasn't wearing one. I politely said they have them for free when you come in. She was not amused
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst It sounds like to me #DrFauci is dictating to @POTUS when our economy will reopen. One person alone should NEVER dictate the fate of #Americans . Our rights are being violated bc of #COVID19 politics. #ReopenAmericaNow
NONE	@morethanmySLE @yokoboji :wave:I can’t find the mask emoji but
FAVOR	Can y’all wear masks so we can freely drink our coffees while shopping around without a mask around our faces?!
FAVOR	@Bill_Maxwell_ Don’t care! He wore a mask, he showed up! He’s awesome!
FAVOR	Why are we closing schools after a diagnosis of #COVID19? Surely by then the proverbial horse has bolted and they may have infected other students or teachers.?#COVID19Aus
NONE	#Covid19 death toll is likely higher than 80,000+ reported due to those who may have passed away at home early on   #DrFauci is 'cautiously optimistic' about vaccine Senator Chris Murray of #Connecticut says expert guidance is needed by states for reopening #CDC   #SenateHearing
FAVOR	@mickjason @PeteFestersen When the TSA started making us remove our shoes, practically strip &amp; let them see details of our bodies in X-ray-like machines just to get on a plane, did you stop flying? If not, why are you OK with that but wearing a mask makes you a #crybaby? #WearADamnMask
NONE	@aeb212 @realDonaldTrump No. But he IS an expert on the deep state and their agenda.
AGAINST	@NCGOP Morons.  You should be advocating for getting rid of the masks, not selling them.
FAVOR	So Dr. Fauci needs security detail as he is receiving death threats for his expertise, honesty and conveying his assessment of just how many lives #COVID19 can cost.  Gee, I wonder who these people are?   #ThursdayThoughts #DrFauci
AGAINST	@Morning_Joe  Well, you Morning joe, idiots President Trump was correct on using #hydroxychloriquine for #coronavirus  and #Trump did not need #DrFauci to tell him to use it or not. #mikabrzezinski is a Dope, who is 2nd fiddle to Joe. So get behind your Man? and stay there Mika.
FAVOR	Watching idiot parents coming to pick their kids up from Camp Covid… Some poor counselor is having to take temperature checks as they drive up, and these stupid parents still aren’t wearing masks! No wonder!

AGAINST	So Senator Warren got her inflated numbers for daily corona virus deaths from Fauchi so the question is has he been inflating them as well? #fakenews #obamagate
FAVOR	All the educated people are supporting #OnlineEducation under these circumstances. The ones who are opposing it only shows how illiterate they are. Not their fault, they didn’t get good schools. And the same will happen if kids today don’t get quality education.
FAVOR	Social distancing in a classroom would require a room the size of a football field and no playtime. @ScottMorrisonMP, why do you insist on putting my wife (teacher) at risk??? #coronavirus
FAVOR	@ync1994 Just try it. you #HoaxPanic lady; just try it. We’ll ship you to Sweden - where no one wears a mask.

NONE	The collaboration of teachers and parents is appreciable as they both maximise their capabilities to keep the young learners engaged to bring back normalcy in their academic routine.Teachers need a fair justice for their undying efforts during the lockdown period.
AGAINST	The credibility of #DrFauci drops every single day he spends standing next to Trump. The worst thing is he clearly knows he's become part of the problem but doesn't have the courage to speak up. #COVID19 #usaCoronavirus
FAVOR	Everyone is so "Pro-Life" until parents just want to keep their children safe during a pandemic and government officials demand we re-open schools. Tell me, is it a "return to normalcy" to sacrifice children to COVID-19? None of my own, but...
FAVOR	Trump is pushing to open schools w/o a plan because anything else makes him wrong &amp; he'd have to take some responsibility. He's that narcissistic that he would risk children's lives to prove he's right even when common sense &amp; science clearly tell you otherwise
FAVOR	@dawn_comfort @LukeMessac @ScottGottliebMD He never said he lied about masks. He said he didn’t want everyone to rush out and buy up the masks that the frontline workers needed. Wear a darn mask and leave Dr Fauci alone! Please and thank you.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump wants to open schools this fall so like clockwork the Dems declare that they want them closed   Predictable   He should pull a George Costanza and propose the opposite so that the Dems end up doing GOP policy
FAVOR	Still beyond me why teens will not be wearing masks in schools :thinking_face:
NONE	@JayInslee You say you are about data and science, but fail to provide any - #voteinsleeout #NoMasks #openwa #OPENAMERICANOW
FAVOR	To all of the Anti-Masker Moms:  Not being able to see your infected child, or infected spouse infected by your infected child while on a ventilator really sucks. But you know what sucks worse?  Casket &amp; urn shopping. #WearAMask
AGAINST	#Uber have a “No Mask No Ride” policy! Is that actually legal! #KBF
NONE	Victorian Education Minister Health Minister and Premier must resign.  #auspol #coronavirus
FAVOR	@donwinslow POS in Chief promised to protect us. That promise should have included our children, teachers, and everyone who works in our schools. Not just the 1%. But the smart ones knew. And we voted for Hillary.
AGAINST	So you touch your mask taking it on and off wearing it under your chin etc etc, then touching door handles etc, and you think that’s good @BBCNolan ps why are we talking about cases now and not deaths from, with or where #covid was mentioned on the death certificate
FAVOR	@RoyLilley Then leave the shop immediately and go somewhere else.The public health advice is to use your common sense, if a place is crowded or feels unsafe, leave. Just imagine being in a classroom with 25 teenagers and no masks,  that what our government wants in 4 weeks.
FAVOR	#DrFauci says it’s critical that we implement this #SocialDistancing strategy right away to slow this thing down so we don’t have our hospitals get overloaded with more patients than they can treat.  #coronavirus
AGAINST	@IngrahamAngle Cuomo forced nursing homes to keep their covid-sick patients resulting in thousands death!   Fauci has been wrong on just about everything.
FAVOR	Never realised how popular @WuTangOfficial became. However protecting ya neck isn’t going to protect you from corona. Wear your mask correctly in public places, cover your mouth and nose. Protect your loved ones, your fellow humans and yourself. #CoronaKills
NONE	@jessie4324 @realDonaldTrump What a joke.
AGAINST	Studies have  shown that the chances of children contracting  COVID-19 are next to nil . Stop throwing shade for your corrupt teachers unions .
AGAINST	#Analogy: Saying you can't go back to work or school until you have a vaccine for #COVID19 is like #DrFauci saying you can't have sex again until there is a vaccine for #AIDS. Partially re-opening is like having safe sex. @greggutfeld @TheFive @JesseBWatters
FAVOR	Poor #DrFauci doing all these interviews because he’s the only one ppl trust. But don’t ask him leading, repetitive questions @cnn. Let the man go home. #coronavirus
FAVOR	@itsaustindoes That mask avatar is @DrAnthonyF #fauci #FauciIsAHero
FAVOR	Dear Entitled White Women - Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. You are an embarrassment to white women who actually give a shit about all humans. No matter their skin color, sexual orientation, religion, or origin.
NONE	@Phreadys Hell to the NO!!!!! I watched him lie on live TV to Congress about MMR reactions. He only corrected himself because moms in the room called him out. He is the fourth reich
AGAINST	@gatewaypundit @GJohnston2014 @RobertKennedyJr @joehoft Seems to me most of #Congress will also get a rake off $$$ from the #coronavirus Vaccine and hoax. This why they will do nothing about
AGAINST	Masks. If you don’t wear one (to be a healthy&amp;sane person), you have to deal w/ potential harassment &amp; being treated like a child by Karens. If you wear one you are deprived of oxygen, your dignity &amp; freedom. You can only force free people to do something for so long...
AGAINST	@davidicke :woman_facepalming_selector:How funny that when in the beginning some people were wearing mask they were called selfish by taking them from nhs staff, but now when all shops stock pile suddenly they are mandatory  :thinking_face: and does like me that refuse to put on this muzzle are called selfish
AGAINST	@MarkSimoneNY @sap_togo @RandPaul  is an Ophthalmologist with a Medical Degree. Rand Paul could give the president better advice about Covid-19 than "Dr." Fauci, a Deep State career-politician swamp-creature who has never practiced actual medicine!
FAVOR	A corona virus briefing without doctors or scientists is just a stupid rally.
FAVOR	@Patzfan5112 @WADeptHealth @GovInslee Many people, including a massive number of idiots in Yakima County did not (and many still don’t) wear masks when advised and then mandated. Many others are only doing it halfway...as in not covering nose and mouth. Bottom line:
AGAINST	@PJB174 No masks because they know they are useless for spread of virus!  The only purpose is to spread fear!  #DoNotComply
AGAINST	6 months into #Hoax2020 and have never worn a mask. Never will. I go out and about daily to shop, etc. Shouldn't I be dead by now?   #LiberalLogic  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder  #LiberalismIsTheRealPandemic
AGAINST	@RexChapman @CharlesRobinson Rex, you do understand there is no medical evidence masks work, right? Not defending the behavior of these 2 dipshits, but wearing a mask does nothing. 
FAVOR	There's many reasons someone may not wear a mask. The only one that should concern anyone is that it's none of your business. Protect yourself. #COVID__19 #MaskUp
FAVOR	On the F &amp; 6 trains (kid needs emergency dental visit :grimacing:) and giving everyone imaginary gold stars for the :100: mask-wearing. I :red_heart_selector:my fellow strap-hangers.
FAVOR	@nbc10_brian @RIHEALTH @GovRaimondo Sort of like how it will be if we stupidly reopen schools next month.
FAVOR	@Mike_Pence @Complex_Ari67 @WhiteHouse Why is the secret service agent the only one smart enough to wear a mask? Also, where is #DrFauci?
NONE	@LorenzoV8456 @TrollingBurner @LukasCostaCoz @Ian56789 Also, this isn't seasonal and this is why people are still dying, it has not gone, just reduced, now we have to find a way to keep it reduced until a vaccine.
FAVOR	@FoxNewsMom @BillStepien @GOPChairwoman Covid cases are coming down. What we need is someone who can lead us out of this madness. Trump is not ever gonna be the mask guy. On the other hand, if people see their kids back in school, and can go outside without fear and mask harassment, I think he has a shot.
NONE	@RealJamesWoods A test of dentists showed that car Ching infectious diseases was equal among dentists wearing vs not wearing masks.  So apparently
AGAINST	Just been morrisons again. #NoMask  Offered a mask on the way in by staff, said no thanks , and was left along. Pretty much everyone else wearing nappies. Although most either not covering nose or mouth.  A few looks my way. But soon stopped when they saw my smile back.
NONE	All these cases in these battle ground States! I'm assuming this is about politics and not about any virus.  CDC is compromised beyond belief . Give everyone HCQ + Zinc
NONE	Agenda= back to coronavirus, here we go again   #RadicalLeft
AGAINST	@jane66_jane @10DowningStreet If you believe that a virus is so deadly you need to wear a mask to be protected from it, what the hell are you doing in @JDSports go home buy on line and wrap yourself in cotton wool until germs are eradicated, let the non terrified live
AGAINST	@TribLIVE FIRE FAUCI, if it is being used and working who needs a fricken study.  Use real life example.
NONE	Wake up India &amp; decide what you want for your schools: Thrive or Die? Gujarat Govt order banning schools from charging legitimate fee for online learning is short sighted populism. We need leadership, not knee jerk reactions. @CMOGuj @PMOIndia @imBhupendrasinh
NONE	Fauci popped up in the news cycle today.  Do his models show round 2 of the coronavirus has started?  Is it time to start hoarding again?
AGAINST	@DineshDSouza @Serious72048896 It worked with @realDonaldTrump This time, and he still keeps these Globalist criminals  " #DrFauci " and #DrBirx the #Scarflady  as "experts" :smirk::unamused:   I'm done watching these #coronavirus updates, Trump is being undermined by all of them, including by " #DrRedfield "
FAVOR	My micro aggressions. When you walk into my store with no mask and dont want me touching your stuff to scan it, IM TOUCHING THAT SHIT.
AGAINST	The only way this mask BS is EVER going to end is if enough of us simply say NO. If we all just said no, there's absolutely nothing they could do. They need us more than we need them.
NONE	143,000 lives lost from #COVID19 #pandemic and @realDonaldTrump speaks for 20 minutes for the first time since April. #FailedPresident #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Sweet baby jeezus it's not about you-Americans want to hear #DrFauci #DrBirx, not you, you egotistical narcissist. #PressBriefings on #covid19 #pandemic are not about ratings, they're about safety &amp; information. Get over yourself. #ItsNotAboutYou
NONE	@realDonaldTrump He sure has a lot to sag about shutdowns, but refuses to answer a simple question about mass protests?!  This man seems to have an agenda.
NONE	@michaeljburry Absolutely this lockdown will have its effects but I’m wondering if there’s any model that can explain the damage from unemployment/lockdown on the economy? #COVID19
FAVOR	@atDavidHoffman He'll be fired b/c, no matter how many times Trump reprimands him, he can't go against his conscience. Politics have always been iffy, but I'll never understand Americans still supporting him--attacking those of us who refuse to along w/lies that literally kill. #DrFauci #COVID19
AGAINST	.@Delicious_Tacos #DrFauci recommends that if we stay home for another 5-6 years, covid-19 will be 99% eradicated...
NONE	@GlennHammond13 @CheriJacobus @ajsfinefoods Not everyone can wear a mask...
AGAINST	@GovTimWalz To expect students to wear masks during school is ridiculous and cruel. Try to remember being 8 yrs old. How would it have been to keep a stupid mask on? This whole administration sucks as does your unconstitutional mask mandate.
NONE	@CBSLA Finally someone’s taking charge of this shit show!! :clap::clap::clap: #RecallGavinNewsom #Scamdemic
NONE	@emilie_anne OMG, people have gone INSANE..
NONE	@DonaldJTrumpJr   If a healthy person is diagnosed with #coronavirus and dies from any other cause, like hit by a bus or anything, our state government counts that as a #Covid19 death.   These numbers are so damn flawed.   Very frustrating.   #GOP
AGAINST	Fuck wearing a mask.  No sheep here #COVID19 #Hoax

NONE	Stay at home if you have #coronavirus symptoms  Stay at home for7days if you have either:  a high temperature a new continuous cough  Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital  You do not need to contact 111 to tell them you're staying at home #Birmingham
AGAINST	@Kingdom49867884 @scratchhere Same! I have gone to my local Walmart, Grocery. CVS and Walgreens this whole time without one! I am definitely the only one most days! One time was told I need a mask but just walked past them... more ppl need to just say
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump EXPERTS like #DrFauci got AMERICANS hooked on opioids and now says a DRUG isn’t QUALIFIED? #Hydroxychloroquine #COVID19
NONE	“I keep getting asked, ‘Do you think there will be a second wave in September or November?’” says Fauci. “We’re not even out of the first wave yet. We are totally immersed in the first wave.” #COVID19
AGAINST	@FollowQanon I’m :face_vomiting: because msm thinks because Trump wore a mask in a hospital we are all of the sudden going to change our stance on this. #MSMEnemyOfThePeople
AGAINST	#Quarantine is for the sick - not the healthy.  Quarantining healthy people is #quackery.  #DrFauci is a quack.  The #CDC and #WHO are corrupted by the #MedicalIndustrialComplex.  #BillGates wants to force-vaccinate you and require PAPERS to leave your house.  Wake up!  #COVID19
NONE	@DeAnna4Congress He has time for this in the middle of a pandemic? Seriously?
NONE	@catturd2 Amen &amp;
FAVOR	Twitler is yet again making false claims and ranting against @DrFaucis1 . I’m from Europe and yeswe shut down the economy , therefore we got a handle of this virus. Anyone with a brain knows that more testing does not mean more cases.
AGAINST	@Destiny3650 @DavidakaWyatt Keep this up idiots will be wearing masks forever!
FAVOR	@steeletalk @richardzussman @masks4canada @CKNW Thank goodness! She needs to be shown the light because clearly she refuses to believe in mask use. It makes zero sense.

FAVOR	@OscarRLanza @tadawes Ooh I get so angry when I wear a mask in 90 degree heat on a run and I run past others who cannot be bothered. #WearAMask #WearAMaskSaveALife
AGAINST	If grocery stores can be open and people can risk their lives working there, then so can the schools and teachers.
FAVOR	Teachers should use their current collective leverage. They can clearly argue our economy largely depends on them. There is no reason trump and his ilk would be so determined to force schools open while #COVID19 is raging if this wasn't true. #COVID19
AGAINST	@NYCMayorsOffice Follow the science, you anti Americans.  Your should be sued for not opening the schools. #DeBlasioResign #WorstMayor #DemocratsHateAmerica

FAVOR	@JonLemire #DrFauci should tell @realDonaldTrump the @WhiteHouse to pound rocks and go straight to hell.  He won't, he's got too much class. Me on the other hand would tell every last one of them to go fuck themselves. #COVID19 #70days #TheBodyBagPresident #TrumpDeathToll137K #TrumpVirus
AGAINST	They re - opening the schools because they losing money ... not because it’s safe outside .

NONE	@dcexaminer Unfortunately.
AGAINST	@randyhillier @mayoushtak The real only option is to stop this farse and send our kids back to school normally.

AGAINST	@cvrup_usa Dude, masks don't help you with virus. Facts proven.
FAVOR	Governor @GovRonDeSantis , why aren’t your offices open? If you want all schools open in a month, open your offices today. #COVID19
AGAINST	1-2% of #children die from #vaccines every year. .0002% of children have died from #Covid19. So...if we are going to keep our schools closed, then we can stop vaccinating the kids, right? #Democrat #COVIDー19 #Trump2020 #AskTheQ #WHOISQ

NONE	@johncardillo If I was as wrong half as much as this fraud is I wouldn’t have a job.
FAVOR	@JenniferJokes @rocko470033 @parkhurstcards Masks help to reduce viral load. You still might get Covid but you won’t get severely sick. Countries (eg: :flag_for_Slovakia: , :flag_for_Japan: etc) with mandatory mask wearing report new cases but look at their number of deaths-very low. If we’re smart, we won’t need lockdowns. 
AGAINST	Been reading that people are finally starting to call out #Fauci.  Wonder what was the straw the broke the camels back?  Was it when he lied about the models? Or the masks? Perhaps when he lied about HCQ?   Or was it the millions of dollars he sent to Wuhan lab?

AGAINST	@Surgeon_General @RPIAthletics Please cite one study that shows masks are more than 1% effective at filtering aerosolized virus.  And don’t cite the ones only looking at unidirectional forward expression.  They admit almost all breath comes out the sides, top, and bottom.

FAVOR	Not sure why there’s so much pant pissing about having to wear a face covering for a short amount of time. Judging by a lot of the folk moaning about it, a face covering is doing them a favour!  #masks  
FAVOR	Okay Trump Followers — Your messiah has spoken and asked you wear a mask. You’re good now!
AGAINST	@aubrey_huff @LisaMei62 Why aren't the homeless getting #COVID? they have no masks, aren't particularly living in sterile environments either #MAGA
FAVOR	@nytimes Is this is a JOKE? Or a Halloween movie?  @realDonaldTrump needs to get out and let the professional handle the problem. We don’t need drama and suspense like if this is a TV show. We need #DrFauci to open this #coronavirus briefings with facts not LIES.
NONE	@AgenteCuadruple @WIREDScience Well you would need to vaccinate against HIV not AIDS and to the best of my knowledge it seems most of the medical community is struggling with a vaccine. So I assume it is not so simple. How is the vaccine that your working on going?
FAVOR	@ChrisMurphyCT @ChrisMurphyCT Can you please hammer this point home with @GovNedLamont ? We can't reopen schools like this.
FAVOR	But now it’s ok to send them to school meanwhile #coronavirus it’s still infecting anyone  There’s no cure No vaccine No treatment   &amp; something like #WearAMaskSaveALife is a fighting issue  Parents Listen to Science Facts Medical Experts  Your children depend on you
FAVOR	@mrswhite321 @Rachael1418 @GovMikeDeWine It isn’t. Mask or ventilator. Make your choice.
FAVOR	These #ComplicitCorruptGOP bastards didn't pass 8th grade biology, but want to attempt to best #DrBright  and #DrFauci Would rather 80k dead than to serve and wrestle with truth. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry Shameless political hackery will continue #COVID19 deaths.
AGAINST	@donaldrusso994 For his huge ego!! He wanted another attempt at a vaccine since the HIV one didn’t work out. America be damned.
FAVOR	#DrBirxIsAQuack After what we experienced during Spring Break, she honestly thinks people won't travel from "high risk" to "low risk" counties? She's a threat to public health Help us #DrFauci  #DrBirx #coronavirus  #TrumpLiesAboutCoronavirus #DrFauciIsANationalHero
AGAINST	Fauci had been wrong so many times and I'm appalled at the comments by the Leftists supporting him. Do they not see his conflicts and that he's a political animal going WAYYY back before Trump ?  Wake up guys. He's a DC player. He's got an agenda. And he's been busted.
AGAINST	@Susicuespin @toddgillman @mmcauliff Masks don’t save@lives.
AGAINST	@ABC What's bizarre is a public health adviser taking it upon himself to lie to the American public about not wearing masks, causing thousands of deaths. Public health advisers don't set policy, they don't make political decisions. They just advise.
NONE	I'm yet to see any EVIDENCE or SCIENCE stating masks :mask: are useful in preventing COVID-19
AGAINST	Sir, we can't let you in without a mask."  "Glad to wear it. Just a heads-up. I get nausea within 2 minutes of using my mask so I might wind up throwing up all over your floor.  I'm sorry, I've tried keeping it in my mask but I don't want to choke on my vomit."   
AGAINST	@thehill Likely true. In tonight's interview with #jessewatters, #DrFauci appears to be still relying on coronavirus data from China, which he admitted earlier in the interview was wrong. Thought he was supposed to be smart?
FAVOR	@kenolin1 Dr. Fauci is one of the most revered and respected physicians/experts in the USA.  No one has ever had a bad thing to say about him regarding his work and ethics but here comes Trump willing to discredit his 40 years of work to deflect responsibility   #TrumpVirus
NONE	Globally #COVID19 #SARSCoV2 has a CFR of 3.3. Influenza for 2019-202 had a CFR of 0.09. The Corona Virus is 36 times more fatal.

FAVOR	#DrFauci #CDC &amp; infectious disease specialist are asking #Covid19 #coronavirus susceptible ppl to wear cloth #masks daily &amp; particularly in hotspots.  This is good advice &amp; it’s a #nudge. It’s part of a goal to #FlattenTheCurve &amp; every #leader should comply. #BehavioralEconomics
FAVOR	@MIFORTRUMP1 @JaniceDean #COVIDIDIOTS gonna covididiot- that’s not hateful just truth. Gov Cuomo followed the science as NY became a hotspot due to it being a travel hub for European, international passengers. NY’s reopening by Phase1, Phase2, Phase3 according to met criteria. #ITrustFauci

NONE	@libertythePD @PattyArquette @CBSLA Yes, hold the OCBE accountable for passing the DANGEROUS &amp; IRRESPONSIBLE “White Paper!” Don’t let them dismiss what they’ve done! Documents have real power when they come from a sitting committee vested w/authority by the people. #Resist
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Lame-o president not talking about how to actually control Covid or his new agenda, hes too busy trying to pat himself on the back with relevant propaganda,his ego is a fragile and inadequate barrier between him and the real world #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #TrumpVirus
AGAINST	@DrEricDing He didn’t get it because he WASNT wearing a mask!!! Covid goes through masks you giant group of idiots!!! And there’s a cure in #hydroxycholoroquine  so get over your stupid #Plandemic rules and regulations that are killing people through depression and suicides!
AGAINST	The mask can only help for so long!  After you fiddle with it for 30 seconds, it’s pretty much ineffective. So just stay away from me! :grinning:
AGAINST	As a socialist, masks are the ultimate tribute to our final goals. Once people stop seeing each other as individuals, and realize we are only as important as the groups we identify with, only then will we reach true socialism. 
FAVOR	I'm not condoning violence, but why are all the stories about people catching a beating over masks about people who actually comply? You would think the non-mask wearers would be the ones on the run.:thinking_face: #MaskItOrCasket
AGAINST	so nice finding some new mask free hangs :relieved: it's nice to be treated like a human again
AGAINST	@TrumpWarRoom Make sure this gets to patients Reminder - Aug 1 2020: 66 studies confirm the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. Deafening silence of the Mainstream Medias, unacceptable mediatic lockdown. #Hydroxychloroquine #Hydroxychloroquineworks #Trump #coronavirus #COVID19

NONE	@SexCounseling Of course!
AGAINST	Unions vow to shut schools down as Covid-19 continues to claim teacher's lives.   Should these unions be successful and schools are closed, do you think that teachers should still receive their full salaries and why?
AGAINST	@RealRomaDowney Wow talk about taking advantage of your privilege Dr Fauci is full on in this for himself What a Fraud
AGAINST	Why is the mainstream Media refusing to report on #DrFauci in funding the Wuhan lab for $millions on gain-of-function for coronavirus?

FAVOR	We can do this. #patriotswearmasks #WearAMask
FAVOR	@stillirise1963 I don’t think self-preservation is in play for many Trump supporters.  Amazingly, many Red Staters think #COVID19 is a complete Hoax!  Others believe Dr Fauci &amp; Bill Gates, etc. are trying to trick the public!  Conspiracy theories abound.  Sad. #DrFauci is a hero #Trump is a zero
NONE	If we gonna shut down schools we mustn’t do it cause of #COVID19 we must do it cause the school system doesn’t work,niggers been going to school and niggers are still broke and stupid :joy:
AGAINST	@marklevinshow And the death rate is down 90% since flu season is over.  Hmm. No comment Dr Fauci?
NONE	It’s hard on the front lines to watch the choices of the population affect our most medically vulnerable.  Please
FAVOR	Lockdown mai we are missing friends,teachers,and our class study but have to follow rules for saving ourself from covid-19 that's why we should focus on online study:innocent:
FAVOR	Today, I’m stoked to have my son back after testing negative for COVID. I hate this virus with a passion (not as much as I hate trump though). It caused me such anxiety. It’s serious folks!#WearADamnMask

AGAINST	@J01543425 @Vicster82 @NeilClark66 My local Tesco (Baldock) wouldn't let me in, said I had to provide evidence for a reason why I wasn't wearing a mask. So I went Sainsbury's, no proof required although I was the only one in there mask free. #UDI
AGAINST	@JerryDunleavy Fauci is a fraud, along with his media cohorts fearmongering the American people over a virus yhat has a 99.4% survival rate! Take your masks, and kindly shove them where the sun don't shine!
NONE	Private schools are not in South Africa?   I sense inequality because they know that Private sector is owned by the other race.   My heart bleeds for Public school leaners :broken_heart: #COVID19
AGAINST	@WVGovernor @WVNationalGuard Vote out RINO @WVGovernor @JimJusticeWV !!! We expected you to stand up for us against the Left’s Fearmongering! Even #FraudFauci admitted that masks don’t help &amp; can harm the wearer! Many people in WV have to work outside in the heat wearing masks! 
NONE	.@realdonaldtrump how does it feel knowing you were responsible for #HermanCaine’s death. #covid19.
FAVOR	It's you vs. the virus. The ONLY way to win is to stop it from spreading by depriving it of future hosts. That means staying the fuck home and wearing a damn mask if you MUST leave the house.
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump He's an expert, you're a failed tv host/failed businessman (who bankrupted a casino!) so I'll go with Dr. Fauci.  The US has more cases due to your FAILURE to act, FAILURE to lead #TrumpVirus #ImPOTUS #TrumpGolfsYouDie #PutinsPuppet #PutinsGOP
FAVOR	@evanmcmurry We can open the schools when we beat the virus- actually do the required close downs and impose 14 days no new cases... the longer we put this off the worse the economic collapse! Ridiculous!
NONE	@AHickinbotham @McCDick Divide and Conquer !   I wish people we see this and understand this   Coronavirus Bill is a control mechanism designed to test our compliance !  If we don’t resist now then it’s game over !

AGAINST	@catturd2 Dr Fraud Fauci sure was careful to not condemn riots and violence.
NONE	Has this panemic time not affected schools and teachers? Central govt when says that nobody's salary should be cut or revamp then why this does not apply to teachers and school staff??
NONE	Schools should've taught us the synonyms for "very very", "really really" and "so so" and what should we use while using fillers like: "uhhhhhh", "like", "mmmm" instead of (a+b)²:woozy_face::pensive:. #englishvocabulary
FAVOR	My mask doesn't stop... um, let's say 'Herefordshire scents' but it does keep my mouth dry from rain.  In other words, oxygen can get through masks, but droplets containing the virus cannot.

FAVOR	@NickInEngland @tubedbeam @jamesmfahy Sorry Nick, I don't live my life on Twitter. Masks have been mandatory since May in Spain, infections are up,local lockdowns enforced.

AGAINST	@Shrimplypibbl10 @ChuckCallesto About half as much as not submitting and refusing the mask all together. If you’re gonna be spiteful, be SPITEFUL!!!! 
FAVOR	@HL23 I was at @ShopprsDrugMart yesterday and the lady behind me was refused entry for not having a mask, it was great! 
AGAINST	@KakosLeonidas @Yamiche He is a businessman and a bureaucrat, not a scientist. He hasn't practiced medicine in 40 years. He has a $ vested interest in finding a vaccine and will keep this going as long as he can. He has NO accountability.Look up his history with AIDS,he killed millions.
AGAINST	OSHA requires 19.5% oxygen levels in a workplace to be safe. Normal breathing =20 to 21% oxygen Masks reduce this level to 17.4% oxygen!!!!  Below OSHA requirements !  #NoMasks #COVID19 
FAVOR	The good thing about anti mask protests is the effectiveness of tear gas.
FAVOR	Knowing what I know from working on the COVID-19 response, I would not send my children to school (if I had any) in the situation Trump is demanding under our current pandemic situation.
FAVOR	@AuschwitzMuseum @candice_counsel If Anne Frank could live in a secret annex with seven other people for two years. I can wear a mask and maintain social distancing.
NONE	@RichardVeii @GrampTorino @gatewaypundit How about you shut down &amp; go away !
FAVOR	@TVsCarlKinsella Tbh, I'll be far less mental than I am now.   I'm diabetic, and the general public are not taking this pandemic seriously enough for me to feel safe outside.  I've apparently a one in ten chance of dying if I catch Covid, so lockdown honestly sounds ideal.
AGAINST	Democrats and the teachers' unions don't care about poor children.  What about all the disadvantaged children who need HS sports to pay their way? Kind of hard for them to succeed in sports when the schools are closed.
AGAINST	@yashar Idiots everywhere just falling in line w/the BS mask thing-wearing masks that DO NOT WORK to stop viruses. But hey, at least they make other morons feel better about their choice to fall in line.  This is beginning to look a lot like a religion. :man_facepalming: WAKE.THE.FUCK.UP. 
AGAINST	@IAGovernor @IGHSAU Yes!  Spend the day outside and get some sun  and no mask and get some fresh air.  Best way to keep up your immune system.
AGAINST	@RamiroParedes @Cernovich Curve WAS flattening until the riots started. My red state Is doing fine! And we opened early, schools are reopening, gyms, little league, we’re fine! #Trump2020Landslide #billclintonlsapedo
FAVOR	It’s intriguing to me that now #COVID19 numbers are on the rise in certain states the amazing &amp; straight-talking #DrFauci is no longer seen on our nightly news programs. I miss hearing his direction, advice &amp; guidelines
AGAINST	@X22Report Fraud Fauci is the ultimate elitist and hypocrite. So we're all supposed to ruin our health wearing masks and damage our psyches through social distancing,  but clearly these rules don't apply to you:face_with_symbols_on_mouth::face_with_symbols_on_mouth::face_with_symbols_on_mouth: #fckfauci #plandemic #scamdemic2020 #Agenda21 #medicaltyranny
AGAINST	@fliss1977 @dockaurG The idea is to create a new generation of even more ignorant people. Easier to control and manipulate by the fewer. I can't believe how easy is to brainwash people. Schools need to reopen normally!
FAVOR	@WCheesemaker @StephenKing No. You’re missing the point. And from the way I phrased my statement I can understand why. I was attempting to point out masks work! They help stop the spread of disease. I should have stated it more clearly. I’m a scientist &amp; a big fan of masks- and science!! :relaxed: 
FAVOR	@hillarywillbern @Adrieliam @SMSCats2 @BillyCorben @TedToddAgency @CharleyTodd Yes... right! @Adrieliam is judging and shaming people who don't wear masks because it endangers his health. Exactly! Now Ms Karen Larp... Was that so hard? :grin: Go reward yourself with some cake!

FAVOR	Can we just listen to the scientists, doctors and other heath experts instead of politician who don't know anything, PLEASE? The sooner we follow the rules and wear masks, the sooner it can return to normal. LISTEN TO DR.FAUCI.
NONE	@fxp123 He's only 27.  Covid-19 can have residual effects on older and younger people.
AGAINST	@DHSCgovuk No.  Why should we?  You use the numbers of people testing positive while being asymptomatic or not hospitalised to further the Draconian and #authoritarian stripping of freedoms and liberties.
FAVOR	Hey so, something weird happened when I went to get my mums medication, some guy honked his car horn at me and gave me a thumbs up, was it because I was wearing a mask? #Covid_19 
FAVOR	@YahooNews Changes come at every turn and everyday we must all thank #DrFauci  and other scientist for trying there best to analyze and track an Invisible Coronavirus,a Virus that will always be mentioned as World History,until we BEAT this Coronavirus...Peace &amp; Prayers
FAVOR	@saraecook @PaulaReidCBS @CBSNews @PeterNavarro45 @realDonaldTrump @VP Fauci is providing truth and clarity to America.  How dare you smear him because his message isn’t what Trump wants to be told.  You are are despicable.  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie

AGAINST	@reaIDonalTrump_ Most definitely! He’s ambiguous. There will never be enough that any of us can do to satisfy #DrFauci! He’s a virologist! Virologists are never happy unless there is a vaccine or the virus is eradicated! They don’t care about living WITH the virus!
FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED u are such a disgusting, disgraceful, ignorant, lying, useless piece of crap! The fact that u would send your own grandchildren back 2 school let alone any child makes complete sense 4 the type of heartless person u are. #COVID19 #coronavirus

FAVOR	@JohnPicacio @gaileyfrey Love it, I just ordered two.  Thanks for making such a great mask.  
AGAINST	It is comical that the same type of 'experts' insisting snow would soon be a thing of antiquity for a few decades now because they told the computer models thats how they wanted it also did the same with #coronavirus eh? All bullshit! #DrFauci :face_with_rolling_eyes:
NONE	@SaraCarterDC @ElaineSako Wow this guy has no business doing anything for the COUNTRY his stripes are revealed even the MSM agrees Cuomo blew it @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  no more evidence needed
