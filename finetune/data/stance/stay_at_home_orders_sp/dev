AGAINST	I knew a half a second after seeing #DrFauci that he would be a darling to the media and the clueless lemming crowd. I don't necessarily have a problem with the guy but he flat out told you that he lied about masks.   That cost how many thousands of lives?  Some of you are dumb.

AGAINST	Dr. Fauci continues to be wrong day after day. Yet, US Senators and the media treat him like a wise king. The doctor put over 20 million Americans out of work based on bogus models. And yet this man — after all of his devastation — still has a job.

NONE	#CDC #DrFauci #COVID19 I am getting tested for the #antibodies or #antivirus since I was sick in February. Not the respiratory part, but the rest of symptoms with some extras, added on just for fun! Why aren’t we checking #VurialLoad ? So important but no one is talking about it!

FAVOR	During a global public health pandemic, you listen to health experts- This isn’t debatable. The American people deserve the truth, and that’s what Dr. Fauci gave them. We were not prepared for the #coronavirus, even though we knew warned. Remember come November.

NONE	It’s not ideal, but it solves part of the issue. Teachers would be in their own classrooms, there’s really not an issue of cross contamination like there would be with the hybrid or full return model. Maybe something to think about? #onted #COVID19

FAVOR	Refusing to wear a mask radiates small dick energy.
AGAINST	@saraecook Fauci is such a hypocrite! He knew back during the SARS outbreak most people who died was due largely to cytokine storm. Much the same with Coronavirus. He had no problem with Hydroxychloroquine being used then.
AGAINST	@punmasterflash I have a problem in my county, I refuse to wear a mask and now I am not allowed to go into the stores to shop for groceries or to any place. If we all refuse to wear masks, no body can buy anything, they loose businesses and money.

AGAINST	@CMOGuj Will you bailout private schools with the per child expenditure of the government in a govt. School in Gujarat. If not then stop politicising education. @Francis_Joseph @AmitCTweets
FAVOR	@thehill @FLOTUS Soooo... open schools so children can be paranoid about germs and risk coronavirus with potential lifelong damaging effects &amp; risking getting elder family sick, so they may die before the kid graduates? Is that how it works?

FAVOR	I just don't understand why schools are opening and the outbreak is getting worse.

FAVOR	@kenyadad12 The people who refuse to wear a mask (aka Cult 45) are truly ignorant and selfish. It’s not even debatable because it’s insanely simple, yet these folks think their “rights” are more important than anyone else’s. Classic trump mentality.

NONE	Y’all remember how stressful @jjabrams #LOST was?    It’s like a lovely vacation / get away from all we’re going through.  Ain’t nothing like a pandemic to make the black smoke monster look like a bbq back draft.    #perspective 
FAVOR	Wearing a mask should not be political. Masks do not silence you, you can still talk with a mask on. It is about caring for others around you — Not your politics. Listen to #DrFauci. Protect others, as you are protecting yourself. Be the solution, not the problem. #WearADamnMask
NONE	@realDonaldTrump it’s time to

FAVOR	@JoshuaPotash @thegoodgodabove The way we'll know if @GOP really thinks it will be safe to go back to classrooms will be if they gut OSHA provisions for Workers Compensation if employees contract work related COVID19 illnesses. That would be a strike-worthy issue. #coronavirus

AGAINST	So where was this #DrFauci faggot in January &amp; February. I knew about the outbreak and it’s potential on January 6th. Where was Fauci? Why was he silent? You’re telling me this man was unaware of Coronavirus until recently? Ok then he’s not credible &amp; should stfu
FAVOR	Say a student contract Covid19, will the entire school shut down and quarantine for 14 days? Will teachers have to notify their children's school because their children are students in a different district. Will their child school have to close? This will be a mess.
FAVOR	Obviously opening schools as usual all across the country is insane and dangerous. However, if you are screaming about closing schools without demanding a solution for parents suddenly without childcare then you do not actually care about parents or children
AGAINST	@jordylancaster @realDonaldTrump Stop the #madness Masks make things worse, you know that!
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn Pipe down until you get us testing, PPE, and safety measures in the classroom. You want us to go, John? Your kids go first.

AGAINST	There is ZERO science that indicates it’s not safe to re open schools.

NONE	It’s not the schools that are scamming, it’s the entire education board or it’s executives on a larger perspective.

NONE	@thomaskaine5 No way. Closed spaces with air/particles recirculating and shops with close contact (salons, etc)? Defies logic. So, you want to risk your life to touch up your roots? Hell no. Salons were innovating and selling kits with your formula and guiding over zoom.#COVID19 #DrFauci

FAVOR	I don’t get why they are waiting for coronavirus to get to schools before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the schools so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it

FAVOR	@Hope012015 The rage in this country over absolutely idiotic and (in the grand scheme) minute things...:exploding_head:. Just wear the damn mask.

FAVOR	A question to the people wearing their masks on their chins...do you think it’s doing anything :thinking_face:
NONE	Schools ensure that teachers continue teaching during these #Pandemic challenging times. Its not easy as they are putting in more efforts than before, besides sustaining their own livelihood. The Govt order will totally destabilise the school ecosystem #teachers

AGAINST	@DC_Draino The high CO2 &amp; low oxygen caused by the MASK impaired Fauci's throw.  P.S.
AGAINST	@RichieAllenShow I think forcing children to wear masks In school will be the line. There are more people against that than there were for the masks in shops. I just wished all the groups against this tyranny would join forces. It is a united cause. #KeepBritainFree #KeepIrelandFree

AGAINST	@profman60 @EndUKLockdown1 @ChrissieGrech @sainsburys @Tesco If masks worked we wouldn't have needed Lockdown....! Masks spread more disease because people touch them all the time, moving them up and down and then they touch things, gross! Wash your hands before touching mouth and eyes is the sensible advice!
NONE	Notice how Fox News places the number of #coronavirus cases &amp; deaths worldwide on a graphic next to Trump when he speaks. That’s to amp the fear factor. #FoxNews has gone downhill since Paul Ryan joined the board of Fox Corp in April 2019.
AGAINST	@Olhoa73 @ProfessorLou1 They don’t WANT Cures Or Prevention. They want people DEAD Miserable Insane Obese Locked Down &amp; Miserable. People need to wake up &amp; as for the Mask people just mind your masks leave us alone.

FAVOR	5. We are social beings by our very nature of being human -   trying to involuntary dehumanize ourselves is not sustainable - maybe for the younger generation by that I mean 5 year olds &amp; below!  We cannot teach old dogs new tricks - bring out the vaccines!
AGAINST	@RandPaul Fauci is incompetent! He has too many conflicts of interest! He needs to recuse himself or be forced out!
NONE	@chuckwoolery I live in NYC, I can assure you Covid 19 is quite real. As I watch it rise across the country, I blame people like you for spewing absolute lies and gaslighting. Trump made this political instead stepping up and leading the entire country through this health crisis. 
NONE	If government has problem with private schools, why central government is privatising sole of its companies? It is because privatization brings decipline and efficiency in system. If government wants to earn money, why not schools?

FAVOR	@MarilynTatman You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution.
NONE	@simondolan These mindless morons have heaved themselves off their sofas to come out and threaten the rest of us.  According to @PHE_uk obesity makes the coronavirus more deadly.
NONE	We are surrounded by viruses like corona but we need to understand that our body can fight with these all things if we boost our immune by proper diet. There is no need of vaccine for every 2nd virus to boost our immune but it is needed by pharma company to make money.

AGAINST	Went to Costco was challenged and told I had to wear a mask I said fine I won’t come in but cancel my membership and I want a refund for what I am not using and boom soon got in
AGAINST	@tarsins @BreesAnna No I wouldn't. If this was the pandemic they predicted over 10million people world wide would have died. I'm sorry for the families who have list their loved ones, however wearing a mask in a normal flu season wouldn't stop it...would it? Peace :heart: #KeepBritainFree
AGAINST	When did #DrFauci get elected? We don't have unelected bureaucrats running this country do we? #coronavirus #lockdown
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump No, we have more cases because you said it was a hoax and no one wants to wear masks. Also teenagers are having large parties because they think they are invincible.
FAVOR	Dear #lausd If I keep my kid home from middle school to keep her safe from #coronavirus #COVID19 it SHOULD NOT count against her as an absence. Please alert families that this’ll be allowed. NOW IS THE TIME TO SAVE LIVES, not when the virus shows up in school
AGAINST	#BillClintonIsAPedo Just curious, do Americans plan to be compliant sheep to their masters or are they going to wear masks FOREVER? Why were John Lewis funeral attendees NOT 6 feet apart, but Christian &amp; Jewish funerals are forced to or dispersed? #MasksDontWork
NONE	@LionelMedia Thuggery #DefundTheBBC #ArrestBillGates

AGAINST	The argument of 'wearing a mask is like wearing pants in public' is not even close to making sense. Since when did pants inhibit your ability to breathe? Do pants cause anxiety attacks? Do pants limit oxygen and make you breathe in CO2 and bacteria? #donotcomply
AGAINST	@DailyMailUK No shit Sherlock, so normal people don't want 2B dictated 2 by little #hitler shop assistants who are gleeful with their new power or put up with good little public minions that glare &amp; confront people not stupid enough 2 wear masks, you do surprise me numbers are down!
FAVOR	Teachers put in a lot of effort to conduct online class. Listen to the teacher and it's a good mode of education in the current scenario. How do we expect schools to pay them without any fees.  #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	Is shutting down schools going to affect teacher and learner's mental health?   #OurFutureNeedsYou #WellnessWednesday
NONE	GOG: Courage would be to openly announce the clear motive “Shut Private Schools”,  why underneath pseudo directive Of “No Fees”? No fees means No schools right?
NONE	@lsingh_77 Laxman Singh ji TUITION fee payment is not the issue. D issue is the mindset. Not everyone is without money &amp; not everyone has lost the job. The mindset that schools are closed so we wouldn’t pay fee is poisonous. Schools are considering genuine fee issues so plz
FAVOR	I support pvt schools for continuing with Online Classes during this Pandemic Covid-19. The online classes allows the children to complete their Academic Syllabus of respective standards. Humble Appeal to Hon Government of Gujarat to re-consider its decision.
FAVOR	Dear President @CyrilRamaphosa, I'm a teacher who has tested positive for  COVID-19. Please shut down schools to protect our children. Economies can be revived, not lives #COVID19 #PresidentialImbizo

FAVOR	@allenskillicorn So, why don't you, @DarrenBaileyIL, and your followers wear a mask, and save the state some money by eliminating the need for this campaign?  Also, maybe help others avoid illness, or worse.
FAVOR	Schools close for an inch of snow or when flu season keeps a lot of students at home sick, but they want to remain open until a confirmed COVID-19 case pops up in the building? It looks like the schools need to be educated. :face_with_rolling_eyes::rage:
FAVOR	@Constance8News I’m so sorry. Why is wearing a mask so hard?
AGAINST	Make sure you wear a mask when your touching EVERYTHING else other people touched who wore their masks. Seriously? Are people really THIS stupid? :woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone:

AGAINST	@Liz_Wheeler Initially, I admired this guy; however, his words &amp; actions regarding COVID-19 have showed me beyond any doubt that he is a phony &amp; a fraud (and maybe worse).

FAVOR	@PadmaLakshmi Don't forget the ever popular "we are the outlier here!"  No shit Sherlock, the countries who have reopened schools didn't totally fuck up their response to this virus. We all need to tell #TrumpTheTwitterTwerp #notmykid
FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED you are crazy if you think the NBA and all it’s resources in a bubble aren’t able to keep Covid out, but the extremely underfunded schools are going to be able to.
NONE	@chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump Other countries get to reopen schools and more for one reason - they didn't have a loser of a leader that ignored the science and allowed the pandemic to get out of control in the US.
FAVOR	We send our children to schools so they get quality education and become something great in future - except being a teacher. And yet one who makes them all is ignored. Irony or hypocrisy?

NONE	@kaitlancollins .@PressSec yesterday ...  “The President has said unmistakably that he wants schools to open ... and when he says ‘open’ he means open and full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school. The science should not stand in the way of this.”

NONE	@CNN Really wondering if we should believe what #DrFauci says. This was what he said on March 8th: "It will take at least a year to a year in a half to have a vaccine we can use," said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Anthony Fauci, MD.  #COVID19

AGAINST	Saturday July 25, 2020. What will Dr Fauci's excuse be for not wearing a mask?  #SaturdayThoughts 
AGAINST	#COVID19 is the 'States' modern day 'Trojan Horse'. States have used the #NewsMedia &amp; #DrFauci to sell fear &amp; panic of #COVID19 using altered infected &amp; cause of death numbers.

FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump do you think Americans are that stupid? #dontcensorus #worstpresident #coronavirus #YouAreNOTaDoctor
FAVOR	@ReallyAmerican1 I work with someone who lives in China, who had assumed that the Chinese news about Americans going to crowded indoor places w/out masks was just "anti-American propaganda," because, she said, "I couldn't believe it! People just aren't that stupid!" @CDC
NONE	@guardian Virus with 99.97 % survival rate. Median age of death with virus 81. 60,000 extra cancer deaths as NHS closed so fat nurses could make tik tok videos. Lockdown was unecessary disaster.
FAVOR	Trump doesn’t care about the 135,000 Americans that have died on his watch. His cronies have been released from prison due to the coronavirus. Do you really think he cares about our children?
NONE	We are free by the goodness of God, not by anything man has done, that is liber ty y. #wednesdaymorning  #amediting  #christianblogs  #July4th #trump  #AtlantaRiot  #COVIDIOTS  #DrFauci
NONE	@gordongekko369 @Molly_NYC @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump No it doesn’t. A case means positive individual. The number of tests is tracked separately. Positives aren’t higher because of testing, but because more people are sick, super genius. Ffs, you can’t be this daft.
NONE	No Shirt No Shoes No Mask No Service
NONE	What are we like. An argument between law enforcement,  government, transport authority, on who should enforce the law on the wearing of masks on public transport. I despair. 
AGAINST	@GovWhitmer @GovMikeDeWine This whole thing started 5 months ago &amp; AT ITS PRIME FAUCI TOLD US NOT TO WEAR MASKS....and now that it is actually NO LONG considered a pandemic NOW HE WANTS US IN MASKS??!!LOL If everyone is NOT catching on that this is political they really are NOT paying attn!!!

NONE	An Arizona teacher, taught summer school with 2 coworkers. They all caught COVID, and she died. @realDonaldTrump was asked about her death,he said, “schools must open”. Then he pivoted to bragging about the NASDAQ. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpResignNow #TrumpKillsUs
AGAINST	@GregAbbott_TX Your mother would be disappointed in you flushing the constitution down the toilet with your mask mandates and lockdowns. #voteabbottout2022
FAVOR	I wonder what the coronation is to folks who buy lottery and don’t wear masks? #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	#DrFauci #Birx #CDC LIED! #Shutdown #BendtheCurve but that’s not what they want, it’s prolonging #COVID2019 infections! #closedbutopen will not eradicate #coronavirus we’re not achieving #HerdImmunity just the opposite! #StayHome will WEAKEN your #ImmuneSystem! #Plandemic2 #Gates
FAVOR	The WH attacking Fauci during a worsening pandemic is like Gilligan’s Island banishing the Professor.  :face_with_rolling_eyes: #COVIDIOTS #TrumpKillsUs #FUTrump
FAVOR	My nephew came back from school with news of an alleged positive case of his physical sciences teacher, who also lost his wife to covid.  The school is continuing as usual, keeping things :zipper__mouth_face:  Why weren't teachers &amp; students tested upon returning to schools?
FAVOR	Why can't students stay home? Teachers can go to their classrooms and teach via zoom or whatever works!  Why haven't schools worked all covid break on this? Teachers' kids can go, as long as they stay with parents? I wish we could work together on this.
NONE	So looks like Blackburn, possibly Bolton are heading for a local lockdown!! I really cannot describe how cross I am with all this now! There’s common sense, then there’s sheer stupidity! This is all getting beyond stupid parody now!! #COVID19 #CovidHoax 
FAVOR	@Constance8News So very sorry for your loss. I pray anti-maskers will get the message that masks do help save lives. #WearAMask
NONE	@PattyMurray I am not taking a Vaccine.....#NoVaccine #PretendVirus
AGAINST	@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump "ignoring our civil rights" is exactly what the fascist Dems are doing, stopping civilian from moving freely, closing businesses, ordering us to stay home. all in the name of a virus with a low kill rate.  #EndDemFascism #AllLivesMatter #BLMTerrorists #EndShutDown
AGAINST	I've been noticing a trend lately -- people are breaking out with acne and infections all over their faces from the mask usage. And that is just the tip of the iceberg of the potential effects of masks. The CDC &amp; Fauci are evil.
NONE	As far as retail shops are concerned legally there are only two types of people: 1. Compliant mask wearers 2. People NOT wearing masks Those not wearing masks are deemed automatically exempt. They cannot challenge you or ask for proof.
NONE	@drdavidsamadi Absolutely criminal
NONE	@RealJamesWoods Yes. Of course. Nothing will save us until we are able to buy a vaccine from you.
NONE	@robreiner Well, if you're @GovRonDeSantis, you can just stop reporting the dead, leading your constituents to a false sense of security and certain death. If you're @Potus, you can stop testing, deluding your followers into believing that, yes, it's all a hoax. 
FAVOR	Our future is in the hands of our children, is not like am saying this because I left school with grade 7 but schools must be closed.
AGAINST	How can you go from saying that the biggest protests in the history of the US didn’t cause a spike in coronavirus cases, to saying there isn’t a safe way to send kids back to school? Just require masks. They were good enough for the mass protests.
FAVOR	Remote learning is not perfect, but it can improve enormously with more focus on fewer subjects at a time.   Children CAN die of Covid-19, as can teachers, all school staff, and family members.   Covid-19 leaves longterm damage we are just learning about.
FAVOR	And all of this is over not wearing a damn mask to buy 2 cigars?!?! Yes this pandemic is tough for all of us, and it sucks when a parent loses custody of their child, but that’s not how you handle it. There are odd, tough jobs you can still get hired on even today.
AGAINST	COVID-19 is SARS2 there is nothing to fear. Hospitals are getting paid to diagnose anything as COVID-19. This IS being used to make @realDonaldTrump look bad. It’s not working anyway.  #MasksWontHelpYou
FAVOR	THE ONLY ONES RUSHING TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS DON’’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE KIDS OR EDUCATION. IT’S POLITICS
FAVOR	Need info on whether a plastic face guard is a SUBSTITUTE for a mask.  I see people in adverts wearing both, but when I see them in stores, it's with SHIELD only and no masks..  #DrFauci #COVID19 #QuestionOfTheDay #Masks4All
FAVOR	Not wearing a mask is "small dick energy."
AGAINST	#Save our schools
AGAINST	@Bonitapip Because it’s pointless, stupid, affects businesses, affects staff and distresses customers.  Do you need any more? 
FAVOR	#DrFauci needs to be on every night talking to us about science, trends, status of vaccines &amp; how to safely reopen. WE ARE IN A CRISIS. #BringBackCommonSense #SaveAmerica
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump Upset that @JesseBWatters didnt ask #DrFauci Y he ignored #Hydroxycloroquine's as a drug to HELP #CoronaVirus sufferers. Fauci, the Med EXPERT shouldve known EVERYTHING about a drug thats been around 4 over 3 decades-bcuz of HIM potentially 1000s of people died unnecessarily IMO!
FAVOR	@bopinion @PhilMurphyNJ @andrewcuomo @News12NJ @PIX11News @WHO How many teachers (veterans, tenor, new) are gonna walk off the job, call out sick because a student decides not to wear a mask and cough intentionally on them #remotelearning is best avoid lawsuits let's be patient #DrFauci
NONE	We are more than happy to showcase all the hard work being put in by the schools, teachers, and the management. Work with us to come up with a solution that works for everyone!
NONE	The order, even if aimed at populism, is ill informed and ill thought out. It does not help anyone. It just perpetuates the inevitable collapse of hundreds and possibly thousands of schools in the coming months. #SaveOurSchools #education @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj
AGAINST	@johnnymcqueen4 I feel it with every fibre of my being these virus tests are being tampered with, fabricated, exaggerated in any way possible to feed the #Agenda21 narrative. A totak #Scamdemic in every way and we just need people to wake up, trust their instincts. #fakevirus
FAVOR	If my 56 year old mother can wear a N95 mask in 100 degree weather, with all her EMS gear on, and take care of patients in sometimes horrible living conditions. You can wear a mask for the 15 minutes while you shop.
NONE	@bbclaurak Why wait? Did you ask him that?  
AGAINST	@ConHome @MattHancock Just stop this. Release new death stats ‘from’ COVID-19 to correct the ‘misleading’ #PHE figures. Barely any hospital admissions/deaths. NHS has spare capacity. No evidence to support mask wearing.  This virus is of no danger to vast majority of people #EndLockdown
FAVOR	@maddow Shocking,,,,, poor #DrFauci will definitely be needing to get his resume updated once someone dumbs down the report and spoon feeds its findings to The Donald. #COVID19 #TrumpVirus #TrudeauLiedPeopleDied
NONE	Anthony Fauci says with one breath that it is impossible to predict what #CoronaVirus/#SARScov2 will do in the Fall, then in in the next, he is certain #COVID19 will be in circulation, in the Fall. #WhiteHouseBriefing #whitehousePressconference
FAVOR	@sapiofoxy ‘Clowns’ trying to help prevent spread of a serious infection, and if ur seeing them they’ll be protecting u. Hardly something to ridicule people for. We need look after each other and masks are one part of this
FAVOR	Called my DRs office to confirm meds dosage and the nurse was contently interrupted by a man who was throwing a fit over wearing a mask in the clinic. I could hear him yelling about Hoax and sensitive people.   I'm getting so tired of this country
AGAINST	@POTUS Mr President, please throw #DrFauci out on his facemask!
FAVOR	@AsburyParkPress Murphy needs to shut down the restaurants. None of the employees are keeping their faces covered. So unsanitary. #WearAMask
NONE	@chrislhayes Weddings were fun. Wine and shop talk nights at the bar were fun. A lot of things were fun. But instead we're here. #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie #coronavirus
AGAINST	@Phreadys No.  He failed in any due diligence of Ferguson’s bogus 14 year old model,undocumented, written as one string of text, let alone his prior mass hysteria projections.  For that alone he deserves to sacked.
AGAINST	Oh, the irony…  Phantom of the Opera, you know, the one with the MASK, is being canned!!!
FAVOR	Schools in Eldoradopark and Edenpark are closed as principals agreed with the parents that although school time is lost it's better for kids to repeat a grade instead of burying children #SchoolMustClose
NONE	Dear Mr President... nobody likes you  #NobodyLikesTrump #TrumpVirus  #VoteForOurLives
FAVOR	2) We as Sadtu want schools to close because of the Standard Operating Procedures are not being implemented consistently across provinces. Schools are operating on autopilot and acting outside the SOP. We won't even get to social inequalities
FAVOR	Someone in my town has CoVID-19 and they have yet to cancel school.
FAVOR	@jsolomonReports @realDonaldTrump Why RT this?? You and #DrFauci said that states should NOT START the PROCESS of opening up businesses until #coronavirus numbers go down for 2 WEEKS. Then a few of your voters protest #ShelterIn orders &amp; you do a complete reversal. You care about your popularity, not our safety
NONE	You have to be into S&amp;M to work for CNN! @realDonaldTrump @MAGA @KAG @NRA @RNC @DNC @FoxNews @cnn  #TrumpTrain2020 #COVID19 #CoVFeFe @GovWhitmer #DemocratsHateAmerica @SpeakerPelosi @JoeBiden
FAVOR	@richardmarx It makes 0 sense that we send kids back to school when we still need to mask up and distance everywhere else.
AGAINST	@mitchellvii It's not correct. The numbers are wrong. The reporting is wrong. But masks spread the virus because no one stops frickin touching them!!!  #coronavirus
NONE	@ABC This should tell you something parents! #SchoolReopening
NONE	@BeckmanDx SCAMDEMIC.
NONE	RT if you support Rand Paul. -- #DrFauci #COVID19
NONE	@savetheturtles2 @VP @realDonaldTrump Too late we just heard #DrFauci testify &amp; wasn't he on news show too or somewhere else talking about #COVID19   Doesn't matter @msnbc has lots of knowledgeable Docs on giving out good info &amp; have pretty much replaced him. I stopped trusting whats-her-name, other Doc. Too tRumpy
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump I'm behind you 1000% but I cannot stand that doctor he's in cahoots with Bill Gates and I don't trust him as far as I could throw him the numbers don't add up so you need to wake up and fire that f****** bastard #COVID19 #DrFauci #BillGatesVirus
FAVOR	@eastantrimmp I went to an ice cream parlor I love. While I ordered, I wore a mask. I sat down, took it off, &amp; enjoyed my dessert. I used hand sanitizer on everything I touched &amp; the table. I put my mask back on, thanked them, &amp; left. It’s not that hard! #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	@ThatParentP4P @Walmart @Walmart - It’s appreciated that employees no longer enforce mask wearing, but customers should be able to shop without being harrassed by other shoppers for not wearing a mask...
NONE	Wonder how much #pfizer stock #Fauci owns? Ever wonder why he keeps the fear level high? Look into his background and vaccines. It all starts to make sense. #FireFauciNow
FAVOR	Like realistically what’s the point in having school tomorrow amid this coronavirus outbreak...
FAVOR	The Trump Cult can send their children to school because obviously they are not to smart, but SMART Americans are NOT sending our children to the SUPER SPREADER schools. Absolutely RIDICULOUS for politicians to expect this while the virus is out of control!!!
AGAINST	@Ek7_PRN No! He has politicized HIV/AIDS for decades in order to drag it out and make money, and now he’s doing the same with Covid-19! He promotes drugs he has a financial stake in the company of origin like Gilead. He is a Gates/Clinton puppet!
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan Daughter in SC wont send her kids. Really spiking in her county. She could be compromised if she gets it. They have been wearing masks, washing hands and social distancing since it started. #Schools #SchoolsReopening
AGAINST	Not sure who knows more about #COVID19, my sister or #DrFauci.  My money is on Stephanie.
AGAINST	@thehill Fauci is a fraud; most doctors I know just laugh at him. He's just another government bureaucrat sitting on his ass collecting a paycheck. He can be right, he can be wrong, but it doesn't matter. He still gets that check.
NONE	How many #ICU beds are in your local hospital? 20? 30? #COVID #COVID19  #masks #MAGA2020   #KAG #TCOT
AGAINST	@teacherspet1958 @Aussiepatriot15 @smhussey @7NewsAustralia No, your hatred has zero effect on those who thrive and prosper, those who will have - regardless of your wishes - an extraordinary LIFE! You're brainwashed, making the mask your escape valve It won't sort your issues Stand up tall and face LIFE as a gift!
NONE	@realDonaldTrump @GovRonDeSantis No more CoVid lockdowns!
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump That's wonderful... NO ONE IS WEARING A MASK..
FAVOR	School nurse when kid gets Coronavirus: here's some ice
AGAINST	Get the ticket for not wearing a mask and take it to court.  Fight it all the way up.  It is a violation of our rights.  #COVIDー19
FAVOR	@wsvn It’s not the masks  stop protesting &amp; having home parties, hotel parties, boat parties etc you see them posting all the parties through Social Media.
NONE	#DrFauci said #covid19 is "10 times more lethal than the seasonal #flu." The seasonal flu kills 250-650,000 people in the US, alone, every year. That means, if we don't get control of this, we could expect 2.5 to 6.5 Million people could die from #Coronavirus in the US, alone.
FAVOR	Oh look, the people who support a man who ran a fake university and a fake charity are saying that the leading expert in infectious diseases endorsed by the Association of Medical Colleges is a fraud. Who to believe? #FakePresident #FakePatriotism #TrumpVirus
AGAINST	@FauciFan RandPaul Thank you,Thank you..just watched your question/answer session with Fauci...Loved everything you said, a dozen countries,  hundreds of millions of people have reopened schools and ZERO new transmission.AMAZING to see someone in Gov has common sense
NONE	What a lack of intestinal fortitude @ScottMorrisonMP you will have the deaths of Australians on your hands. When we reach 12 pages of obituaries like Italy please look in the mirror for the cause. #lockusdown #COVID19Aus #coronavirus
FAVOR	#Singapore has a 95% nationwide #mask compliance. Approx 55% of US citizens are wearing masks. As an example, Singapore has a population density 41 times higher than Maricopa County AZ, but has less than half the number of #Covid_19 cases. #WearAMask
AGAINST	I saw many Buddhists doing rituals to fight against #coronavirus Dear brothers and sisters, we should make rituals against stupidity and sheep mentality. This is the real danger nowadays.  #NoMasks
AGAINST	@JohmBoFlavin @Cernovich They can't force you to wear a mask.
AGAINST	@BoSnerdley @politico And it was much better Clear, concise, informative, reassuring tone Dr Fauci has been so all over the block that it’s hard to know what is solid info and what isn’t And his love of celebrity is off-putting for a medical professional  @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #COVID19 
NONE	Has anyone seen the "R" rate? its gone missing? haven't seen or heard of it for weeks!  #Covid_19 #exposebillgatesday #COVIDIOTS
FAVOR	#Trump 5/13 says Dr. #Fauci #DrFauci made “Not an acceptable answer” is outrageous ridicule. Trump for weeks been lying abt the number of #COVID19 deaths w a 2nd set of books. Today we found out he’s suppressed @CDCgov guidelines for #Coronavirus openings prepared before 4/24.
AGAINST	Someone needs to do a study on how many ardent mask-wears got COVID-19 since we all know (including the government) that masks don’t work.
FAVOR	Why doesn't #DrFauci simply quit working for the @WhiteHouse and hang @realDonaldTrump out to dry? Couldn't he then #testify for the #foreignaffairscommittee? He'd still have a platform to keep info going out to the public and we'd get the #truth instead of daily BS! #COVID19
NONE	@SteveSchmidtSES @AmericanAir your not keeping the public safe.  Shame on you
NONE	@realDonaldTrump &amp; @VP are to start daily #TrumpVirus briefings again. If you're going to lie (and we know when you're lying)..congratulate yourself though you don't deserve praise, or turn it into a chance to campaign and slam Democrats..DON'T.EVEN.SPEAK!
FAVOR	Hide the scientist's knowledge from the public? Trump has to go. Shades of the Mueller investigation. This administration can't let the truth get in the way of their disinformation, now can they?  #COVID19 #DailyBriefing
FAVOR	@DanCrenshawTX Don’t reopen schools in the fall. Protect your children from a failed government and the deluded sycophants that continue to support it.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump I see Fauci is no better at pitching than he is practicing medicine.
FAVOR	@SteveDeaceShow Pence is more worried about Space Force than #COVID19 and they horrors being forced on the country.   Civil action will be our own relief.
AGAINST	@IlhanMN Also because the majority of masks on the market, including the one your kid is wearing as a chin strap, aren’t medical grade and therefore do nothing.
FAVOR	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren.
AGAINST	@GovRonDeSantis @RonDeSantisFL @CFUrbanLeague And one of those choices should be in person school with NO masks!!! #schoolchoice #Casedemic
AGAINST	Another reason they want to muzzle us is to prevent us from communicating with each other  #masks
NONE	@maydaymindy9 80000+ dead from #COVID19 and she is “concerned” about cavities while she votes to overturn Obamacare and take away protections for pre existing conditions.  #ignorance #Hypocrisy @GOP @SenateGOP #FactsMatter #DrFauci #TuesdayThoughts
FAVOR	When you wear a mask, wear it correctly... cover your mouth AND nose... #WearAMask #besmart
FAVOR	@IngrahamAngle Fixed it for you: Democrats #WearAMask &amp; are #SociallyDistant.  Republicans who ignore medical experts, like #DrFauci, will spread #COVID19 and potentially harm themselves and others.   You can't wish #COVID19 away, but you can mitigate the deaths.  #FactsMatter #ScienceMatters
NONE	@GavinNewsom the SCIENCE doesnt support the use of masks.
AGAINST	@HillaryClinton Citizens shouldn’t be subject to infection via contact w/ protesters, unknowingly. For protesting to be more important than church, businesses, and schools remaining open shows our country has a biased view of what is effective against this shit and what isn’t.
AGAINST	@hrkbenowen Never worn any type of mask.
FAVOR	Let’s get something straight: no one is comfortable wearing a mask. I don’t wake up every morning excited to cover my face, but I do it anyways b/c it’s the right thing to do for myself and those around me. Just get with it already....#COVID19
FAVOR	@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Dear Senator, thank you for all you do to represent Oregon. Hair clippers are fairly inexpensive and easy to use. Or next time you’re in the valley, I’ll even trim your hair, mask and all. And as an educator I have practiced social distancing all summer.  :scissors_selector: :man_getting_haircut_selector:
FAVOR	Unless the so called madam minister Angie gets infected by the virus that the only way she'll finally gain her conscious and decides to close schools if not then she'll want to sacrifice our children for their own amusement we should protest if we have too!!!
AGAINST	Oh look China getting more new cases. You still think that mask is saving you or anyone else.  You're less protected because most of you are ignoring social distancing rules, constantly handling your mask.
AGAINST	@NYGovCuomo Fake science, there a lot of individual doctors coming out and disagreeing with Fauchi!!! He was wrong on this plandamic so many times!
FAVOR	@weijia @CBSNews @DanScavino @Scavino45 More maturity from the ‘leaders’ I see.  Fauci , like any other scientist goes with the facts AT THAT TIME.  we can’t get people to wear a mask but they’ll second guess one of the greatest minds on infectious disease..  Dumb in the extreme.
NONE	While picking up "essentials" at the store today, I noticed that they have a good stock of "novelty" masks. All made in China.  Why is China profiting from their misdeeds?  #BuyAmerican 
AGAINST	@johncardillo @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump #DrFauci is the arsonist AND the fire fighter.  #COVID19
AGAINST	@GMan40401036 @e_iaco Calm down with your hate. Instead ask yourself how did Fauci make a net worth of $500 million? You can not accumulate that kind of wealth from a six figure salary. Fauci is the modern day Josef Mengele
FAVOR	A mask is not a political statement ... it is an IQ Test!
AGAINST	@CQEverything @cjtruth @NEPatriot17 @Femmefataletx @SSG_PAIN @intheMatrixxx @3days3nights went to target with my fiancé. Masks required. Walked in without one and not a word
AGAINST	@RealJamesWoods @ck515 So I’m getting my response for mask shaming ready. Think I’ll put on my chicken wire mask. Just as effective due to virus partial size. Need creative input patriots.
NONE	If you weren't wearing a mask last week, why are you now? #Masks
AGAINST	Reminder:  #DrFauci’s statements from January to March were WRONG about #COVID19!  -It’s not a threat to the #USA -#Americans don’t need to “run around” in masks -Hydroxychloroquine does not work -Lockdowns are right, STILL  #WeThePeople should not be listening to Dr Fauci!
AGAINST	Am I the only one a bit worried about seeing legend Francous Pinaar, in a black mask, kneeling with a raised fist. It's very disturbing. Very wrong. This image is being imprinted on childrens brains....stop it now. #kbf
AGAINST	@OregonGovBrown I find it disturbing that at the beginning of the outbreak we had a month of lectures on how masks don't work, especially many from Dr. Fauci and I am wondering how anyone has any faith in him knowing he lied.  Random cloth coverings are not going to stop the spread
AGAINST	@BardsFM Today in California I went into Walmart. I was asked to put on a mask and I kindly said I have a health condition. She said no problem and let me in. I was the only person in the store without one. Instead of evil stares, people were happy to see a smiling face again.
FAVOR	@DocBastard You know whats more uncomfortable than a mask? A tube on your fucking gut. #WearTheDamnMask
FAVOR	I didn't know that wearing a mask and staying at home was mission impossible, like damn man. Ya'll had one job and managed to fuck it up. Smh
NONE	@robreiner With the help of the Republican Party! #TrumpVirus
AGAINST	Take sports away and Social Interaction in schools. Your kids will have a great immune system! Way to teach your kids your saving them from the coronavirus. Bill gates and all Ted Talk technocrats have wanted online learning for years. Wake up!
AGAINST	They lost me on effectiveness of masks working when they release prisoners, mostly convicted pedophiles,  from prison instead of providing them masks.  #WWG1GWA
FAVOR	@DrEricDing So basically, temperature screenings are not enough. Asymptomatic spread.  :mask:  #coronavirus #COVID19  #schoolsreopening
AGAINST	Just been to the Petrol station. About 50-60% not in masks! Police turned up- they just went to subway... tide is turning! #NormalPeople
NONE	@deerfield_b @TimRunsHisMouth Fake science :dna:
NONE	If we can't take hydroxy chloroquine bc of of an incredibly small chance of arythmia, then we need to remove ALL Drugs with potential harmful side effects. #COVID19 #coronavirus #lockdownextension
AGAINST	They are forcing us to adhere to “guidelines” not LAWS. We need to go to COURT!
FAVOR	Donald Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and kill a million schoolchildren via #COVID19 and not lose any #MAGA voters..
FAVOR	I honestly think students should start staying off school at the moment. Covid-19 is now confirmed in my town and it’s sure to spread like rapid fire. I don’t understand why the schools aren’t shutting down or at least doing deep cleans
AGAINST	@mnhouseDFL #noBondingBill until Walz powers removed. #Scamdemic #covidHoax
FAVOR	Now stop calling them schools, colleges, universities because they are test centers now. You have to teach at home &amp; schools just to rate excellent, good, poor. Honestly, I am speaking after experience of children education. Therefore, make everything online.
