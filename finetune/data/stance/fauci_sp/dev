FAVOR	We must boycott our schools, and protest to have the schools shut down, due to coronavirus. It's not only threatening to us as students, but to our parents. PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THIS SITUATION ISN'T AS BAD AS IT SEEMS, YOU ARE DELUSIONAL AS FUCK!
FAVOR	Fredrick Ingram, president of Florida's largest teachers' union has accused DeSantis, tЯump of "playing politics with children's lives" as they continue to push for schools to reopen even as new coronavirus cases are on the rise in Florida and across the country.
FAVOR	@JenniferJokes @rocko470033 @parkhurstcards Masks help to reduce viral load. You still might get Covid but you won’t get severely sick. Countries (eg: :flag_for_Slovakia: , :flag_for_Japan: etc) with mandatory mask wearing report new cases but look at their number of deaths-very low. If we’re smart, we won’t need lockdowns.

FAVOR	You won’t wear a mask? If I get it from you, and I pass it on to my elderly mum, you’re a dead man. #COVID19AB  #COVID19
AGAINST	Damn you California!! I’m coming to Napa for the first time, with empty credit cards...and you shut the state down! Idiots. #californiashutdown #ThinkForYourself #napavalley #winekillscovid
NONE	Anyone who would strap a mask on their child's face for 5 minutes let alone 7 hours should be jailed for child abuse.    Any Dr. who recommends putting a mask on a child should be stripped of their medical license - at the minimum.
FAVOR	When you wear a mask, wear it correctly... cover your mouth AND nose... #WearAMask #besmart
AGAINST	@GovAndyBeshear @BritainyBeshear No kids are dying dumbass.  stop the fear mongering, now you have your wife doing it too?  Jeez.  See you at St. Matthews baseball fields tonight, I'll be the one without a mask.
NONE	:notes::arrow_forward:Find a bae @iamkissdaniel    On #TRENDVILLA @fomaliciousbabe @Akpos_carrytalk @Djitchyfingazz #spinning:repeat_one: LISTENLIVEON #OURAPPONPLAYSTORE AND #WEBSITEONBIO
FAVOR	Am I ever going to learn that my phone doesn’t recognize me when I have my mask on? But still...
FAVOR	My family is living in fear because my brother is going to college with two staff members who interacted with someone who passed away due to the coronavirus. And yet they won't close the school? Why? Don't you want to protect the students?
NONE	@tahntahn76 @llojak How do these evil bastards get away with this ???
NONE	@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You are patting yourself on the back for a service that the people now need because of the #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirusDeathToll156K #VoteForOurLives #RepublicansForBiden
NONE	#SaveOurSchools When other states are exploring options on how to ensure education for all, here we are focussed on disturbing what’s working. How will schools function without fees? How will teachers teach without salaries? #SaveOurSchools @imBhupendrasinh
AGAINST	@jakekill20 @eatmorcheeks @PatrickPenney11 @thejtlewis @elonmusk . Yeah, but 0bama's had worse numbers, but he had the media in his pocket, so.  #Plandemic  #Scamdemic
NONE	“Practice Media Distancing” stay at least 50’ away from any TV or Radio that’s playing the news! #FakeNews #FakeNewsPropaganda #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #coronavirus #COVID19
FAVOR	@Adam_Creighton What absolute rubbish! If people did the right thing instead of being selfish, we would not be in this position. Some people need the big stick before they take any notice.
FAVOR	@donwinslow Thank you for creating such a poignant reminder that children should not bear consequences of adult failures.  #COVID19 is more of a threat than it was in March when schools closed.  For now
AGAINST	@CoronaDoubter @Dirk_aus_Hessen a virus so DEADLY  that you need mass testing with useless tests to prove it exists:thinking_face:  #nomasks
AGAINST	@JoeBiden @POTUS works 7 days a week . . . EVERYONE is entitled to some healthy exercise and fresh air.  #Fauci is a swinging pendulum of random opinions.
AGAINST	All people who are wearing masks, and still feeling ok, you must be young and healthy.   The elderly seem to be dying a lot (as reported by MSM) they have ALL BEEN WEARING MASKS.   My heart goes out to all those who have been deceived by out world leaders.
FAVOR	@DrsuzanneH You see it's because of populistic morons like yourself that we have trouble getting this virus under control!  #WearAMask #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	@John99601526 @EntheosShines @Drrramina Your argument fails to acknowledge that hypoxia involves the body not getting sufficient levels of oxygen. It does not mean you’ll pass out. What it means is your organs aren’t getting the oxygen they need to function at an optimal level. And that includes your brain.
AGAINST	My morning train to London. Still on about 1/4 full and at least 90% wearing masks.  When are people going to wake up and take back their lives?   #newabnormal #covidhoax
