FAVOR	It's not just about #Gujarat It's about the entire nation. We need to save schools throughout India. We need to protect the rights of every child in India. No school in any state, no teacher in any state and no student in any state should be  left behind.

NONE	@lsbeachy @tarttea Hope the craziness ends soon!
AGAINST	@GovNedLamont Or maybe we just reached herd immunity? Follow the data, believe the science. Look at all the kids playing basketball and soccer.
AGAINST	@PlanetFitness I can’t describe how disappointed I am in your company. To require masks even for those with health issues is insane. To not allow us to cancel our membership without penalty is practically criminal. #ShameOnYou
AGAINST	@punmasterflash I have a problem in my county, I refuse to wear a mask and now I am not allowed to go into the stores to shop for groceries or to any place. If we all refuse to wear masks, no body can buy anything, they loose businesses and money. 
FAVOR	Now Cohen is getting released. Just so we keep the record straight I’d like to remind everyone Covid-19 has made prisons so dangerous that Manafort, Stone, and Cohen are not incarcerated. Meanwhile President Ding Dong is lobbying for kids to be in school.
AGAINST	@nicely_nick @LockdownNo I'm not wearing a muzzle. I don't care how much Boris stamps his boots.  Visiting the shop a again for the first time in ages would've been a great relief after all this.  But forcing muzzles. That's just stopped me, my family and friends from going now.:angry: #NoMasks

AGAINST	I got yelled yesterday by some male version of Karen for not wearing mask at the vegetable store . Poor soul was triggered by it and probably had his vagina inflamed for seeing me without mask.
FAVOR	Trump and the Republican party- abortion is a sin and it's murdering babies. Also Trump and the Republicans- We are completely reopening schools this fall and we don't care if kids die due to the virus. The hypocrisy here.
AGAINST	@Susej137 @FormerDem3 @diana4candor @GavinNewsom Numbers are going up because testing has increased exponentially.  Fatality rates have declined significantly across the country.  But I bet you didn't hear that from the #MainstreamMedia   #changethechannel #wuhanhoax
AGAINST	@yashar Idiots everywhere just falling in line w/the BS mask thing-wearing masks that DO NOT WORK to stop viruses. But hey, at least they make other morons feel better about their choice to fall in line.  This is beginning to look a lot like a religion. :man_facepalming: WAKE.THE.FUCK.UP. 
NONE	School is a community where we enlighten innocent minds &amp; prepare them for the future challenges. But Present Policies &amp;  Political involvement has completely ruined the educational structure of our schools,colleges &amp; private institutions.

NONE	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits.

FAVOR	@cleverkate I have been wondering what is the right approach. By saying nothing you are in turn approving a behavior. I was @Costco and a mom w/ a child and husband (both w/ masks on) wasn't wearing one. I politely said they have them for free when you come in. She was not amused

FAVOR	@emzorbit Florida has a 14% positive rate on testing. They were 5% when they reopened. Missouri is at 5%.  #WearAMask and MO won't repeat Florida.  #WearAMask and schools can reopen sooner.  #WearAMask because it is truly American to care about others.  
AGAINST	Media claim the UK had the most excess deaths during lockdown. Firstly, I'm not sure if this is true. Secondly, it's implied the excess deaths are due to Covid19. When in reality they are probably due to the NHS closing its doors to everything over than Covid! #COVID19

NONE	So much anger and distrust, but why?
NONE	Before asking schools to not charge fee for providing service of online education, gujrat government should have arranged free online education to all students of gujrat. Very bad and sad sermon

FAVOR	@donwinslow @GovRonDeSantis Not only do we have Covid-19 to fear if forced to send our kids to school during this pandemic, we also have to fear "Karen's" kids who are not allowed to wear masks.

AGAINST	@TexasTribune Even if it's ridiculous &amp; unnecessary? Even if it causes our students to fall behind, be at greater risk for child abuse, &amp; causes parents to lose their livelyhoods because they are unable to work? Closing schools is disgraceful &amp; history will not treat you kindly.
AGAINST	@fordnation Recent studies on the hundreds of protest showed that lack of social distancing had no impact on infection rates.  When will you and your Confederacy of Dunces drop the charade and open us up completely?
AGAINST	After causing so much collateral damage, #lockdowns did’t even work to stop the spread!  #Ontario
FAVOR	Schools in Eldoradopark and Edenpark are closed as principals agreed with the parents that although school time is lost it's better for kids to repeat a grade instead of burying children #SchoolMustClose
AGAINST	@intheMatrixxx Masks are not an effective tool to prevent the spread of infectious respiratory viruses!  However they are effective symbols of fear!
NONE	Why does ut matteruf schools get defudnded if they dont open. 1. If they aren't open they arent gonna be spending money on shit anyway. 2. People don't learn anything at s hool anyway either, except how to cheat and lie. They can look up shit on their phones. 
FAVOR	What about the kids are being forced to go back to school because their parents are virus/pandemic deniers? Our kiddos are more aware than some give them credit for. That’s not an environment that promotes learning. That’s an environment that can create PTSD.

AGAINST	This should be the last #lockdown  Come September society must re-open; it's utterly irrational for us live like this. We lived through worse flu seasons without shutdowns &amp; there is a greater health #crisis unfolding, far worse than the #Covid_19 virus, itself.

NONE	@donwinslow This is nothing but the truth. Did Twitter censure the bounty Hoax tweet Trump put out, no they didn’t &amp; that tweet is a total lie. NATO and allies were briefed along with Trump himself. So no, @TwitterSupport, this video speaks the truth &amp; nothing is embellished.
FAVOR	Teachers should use their current collective leverage. They can clearly argue our economy largely depends on them. There is no reason trump and his ilk would be so determined to force schools open while #COVID19 is raging if this wasn't true. #COVID19

FAVOR	@kaitlancollins @mkraju Hardly anyone wearing masks. Another bad message.

AGAINST	@BiscAnenome @SikeNawGaming @BardsFM Weird how many doctors say masks aren't the answer except in situations like surgery to avoid coughing or sneezing into an open incision.   Masks don't block viruses anyway.  Our health is damaged if we restrict our breathing. Our immune system too.   Goodbye.

FAVOR	If someone refuses to wear a mask on a plane, why not remove them during takeoff?

AGAINST	@Surgeon_General @RPIAthletics Please cite one study that shows masks are more than 1% effective at filtering aerosolized virus.  And don’t cite the ones only looking at unidirectional forward expression.  They admit almost all breath comes out the sides, top, and bottom.

FAVOR	@davidnwelton @mkraju @SherrynAdair @SpeakerPelosi It’s time for people to act responsibly. There is enough evidence that masks work. Adults shouldn’t have to be told to wear a mask. It’s not a political statement it’s what makes us all safer.

AGAINST	@jenleahhh Awww yeah! Absolutely keep doing this! No masks for me or mi familia! Keep the courage, others will follow.  I didn’t wear a mask a couple days ago and I saw an older man pull down his mask and tell his wife this was bs and if I can then surely he can as well.
AGAINST	Happy Friday everyone. Just want to send out a huge FUCK YOU!!! to all the stores who won't let us in without a mask. Who deny us the choice to social distance instead of wearing a suffocating mask. May the bird of paradise shit on your head!

NONE	@JustMEtillDeath @Francis_Joseph Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought
FAVOR	@jimdonovancbs3 @SEPTA No need to be patient. Not wearing a mask in public (as mandated by PA Governor) is the equivalent of swinging around a gun with the safety off; somebody’s going to get hurt. That said, I see Philadelphia P/O watch people walk around w/o masks and they say nada!
FAVOR	Trump is pushing to open schools w/o a plan because anything else makes him wrong &amp; he'd have to take some responsibility. He's that narcissistic that he would risk children's lives to prove he's right even when common sense &amp; science clearly tell you otherwise

AGAINST	Defund Teachers if you don't reopen schools.  #ReOpenSchools
AGAINST	#Democrat Leaders &amp; #Teachers Unions don't care about your children or your teachers. They're closing schools &amp; mandating elearning when the #Science demands the opposite. Children are least likely to catch #COVID19 &amp; spread it to teachers, parents, &amp; grandparents.
FAVOR	Flying abroad......SELFISH ACTS AT THIS TIME.....
FAVOR	I will be homeschooling my son if our district doesn't offer an online option.  I won't be sacrificing anyone for Trump's reelection campaign or the economy.

FAVOR	It doesn't feel safe to ride with the @MBTA because they aren't enforcing their mask policy on all their trains

AGAINST	But I don’t get it. Why?? Why is everybody behind the pillar of civilisation?  Is the ripple effect not visible? Schools collapsing will result in the entire nation’s collapse!
NONE	@Alyssa_Milano I wear a mask everyday for 5 hours at work. There is no reason why someone has to complain about wearing a mask for 5 minutes. #StaySafe #StayHealthy and if you can't wear a mask then
AGAINST	@DailyMailUK Give it 6 months and the streets will be full of people wishing they had spoken out now or in the last 14 weeks. Liberty is so important and it’s been given away so cheaply. Mass unemployment incoming, not going to be pretty, NHS has shut down for 4 months.

AGAINST	@EducateCT @GovNedLamont @teachcardona A combination of testing, masks and outdoor activities when possible can help. Let's open our schools for 5 days in person classes.
AGAINST	@Real_Eudaimonia Nice. For your sake, I hope the 4 deeply conservatives see through the covid BS and open schools on time, and with none of the unnecessary social distancing precautions.
AGAINST	@GovNedLamont It’s called herd immunity. Lockdown were too late to have any effect in CT.  For all the science deniers, if herd immunity is impossible then vaccine wouldn’t help.

FAVOR	My mask doesn't stop... um, let's say 'Herefordshire scents' but it does keep my mouth dry from rain.  In other words, oxygen can get through masks, but droplets containing the virus cannot.
FAVOR	I guess my school thinks that there are too many students. So they aren’t canceling school, and allowing like 3000 kids who shove their fingers in each others mouths to come and wipe their grubby ass hands all over the building. Imma stay home #coronavirus

AGAINST	Because once we get to HIT, even high-risk individuals bear little risk! And yes, COVID19 will come back each year, but each return will have materially less impact. In fact, it most likely will simply become the fifth coronavirus to cause the common cold.

AGAINST	@TimRunsHisMouth Parents in LA need to enroll their kids in charter &amp; private schools now and tell the LATU to stuff it! #LATU clearly hates children if they want to take away a family's choice of which school is best for their child. Unionless schools with merit pay all the way!

FAVOR	@DNCWarRoom @IMontoyaResists There is no way my 3 kids are physically going back to school in the Fall. They all want to, but Trump has purposefully bungled our response to Covid so badly schools can't reasonably be made safe right now.

FAVOR	D'ya know why Trump has a boner about opening schools? So parents go back to work &amp; he can claim a revitalized economy for election. Trump is willing to bet your kids lives to WIN An Election.

FAVOR	Being the only one in Ace Hardware wearing a mask feels very similar to when they'd assign group projects in school.  Except then I could at least do all the work myself.
FAVOR	Everyday parents choose to send their kids to schools understanding there are risks, be it bulling to shootings. My Sons school was locked down 4 times last year, 3 guns, 1 bomb threat. Schools haven’t been safe for awhile. This is simply one more thing to consider.
FAVOR	Dear #lausd If I keep my kid home from middle school to keep her safe from #coronavirus #COVID19 it SHOULD NOT count against her as an absence. Please alert families that this’ll be allowed. NOW IS THE TIME TO SAVE LIVES, not when the virus shows up in school

AGAINST	And there hours of operation are Mon thru Fri 7 am to 6pm...so why are schools shut down again?
FAVOR	@MaryRedden1 Even some of the suburban schools have issues with cleaning supplies and ask parents to provide them at the beginning of the year. With most people unemployed this is untenable.  #keepsafe  #schools
NONE	So many schools in Indian are being closed for the #COVID19 but not my sisters school district. I had the H1N1 and my mom didnt think is was a big deal and decided to not get me a shot. Sh regretted it after I got ill and had to go to the hospital.

NONE	Schools ensure that teachers continue teaching during these #Pandemic challenging times. Its not easy as they are putting in more efforts than before, besides sustaining their own livelihood. The Govt order will totally destabilise the school ecosystem #teachers
AGAINST	@foxandfriends what a shit network!  Trump says there’s a time and a place for masks!  Huge difference between a hospital and your local business.  Propaganda!
AGAINST	Schools must open in the fall. Early learning (K-4th) is so vital. Children won’t get what they need in most homes.

FAVOR	@wiscontext @WashCoWisco @PBSWI @WashCoExec Over 148,000 Americans :flag_for_United_States: have died.

FAVOR	The objectives of the Victorian government's measures are twofold: - to reduce the number of people moving around - to reduce workplace transmissions These goals need to be kept in mind by all of us or we'll be in "lockdown" for longer than we need to.
AGAINST	The lockdown is even killin more people than the virus
FAVOR	Seriously, why do I smile as I pass by people while wearing my mask? But still, 
FAVOR	@KAG45Patriot #facemasks are mostly effective when wore by the sick people. As it is difficult to know who is sick and who is not, if mass people #WearAMask in public places it can significantly reduce the spread of the virus.

AGAINST	The policymakers need to consider the fact that schools can't run without fees and teachers can't survive without salary.
FAVOR	Children can't maintain social distancing!
FAVOR	@marcorubio There is no absolute here.  Kids need schooling which is education, not "need to go back to school" which is a place.  The cost of life outweighs the cost of being at a place every time. Stop word-smithing your way around an issue that could kill thousands.  
AGAINST	@RepTedDeutch Instead of trying to order us around, help the hospitals, help the healthcare workers, and We The People can assess the risk ourselves whether to close a business or wear a face mask. More gov destroys everything #VoteRedToSaveAmerica

FAVOR	@TVsCarlKinsella Tbh, I'll be far less mental than I am now.   I'm diabetic, and the general public are not taking this pandemic seriously enough for me to feel safe outside.  I've apparently a one in ten chance of dying if I catch Covid, so lockdown honestly sounds ideal.

AGAINST	@simondolan @bmstores Ooh, this issue has me conflicted; yes, masks for kids are abhorrent, but profiting from the stupid is so tempting... ultimately, i guess my moral compass would force me to do the right thing and boycott them though. A fool and his money... #idiots

AGAINST	@BardsFM Today in California I went into Walmart. I was asked to put on a mask and I kindly said I have a health condition. She said no problem and let me in. I was the only person in the store without one. Instead of evil stares, people were happy to see a smiling face again.

FAVOR	@MarilynTatman You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution.
FAVOR	@Hardees it’s a little disheartening that most of your employees in your Athens, Tennessee store were not wearing masks!!! Care more about your customers!!! #StopCovid
FAVOR	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back

FAVOR	Wear a mask please.  #WearAMask
AGAINST	We aren't against teachers we are just against this system. Just think, education that is a base of the future of an individual is fully dependant on apps. Ans for that schools are taking fees and  teachers aren't paid if they are unable to teach online.

AGAINST	@abc7newsbayarea What if you cannot breathe through masks and have a health condition or ptsd, claustrophobia, autism, etc?  People should be exempt from masking.  We have a right to breathe air and exhale CO2 in and out of our mouths and noses.  #ReopenAmerica

FAVOR	It’s good to see a shift in consumer behavior re: masks when corporations (esp. those that serve non-compliant areas) enact rules. Virtually no masks ~1mo ago at my parent’s local @Walmart. Today? &gt;70% compliance. (Both observations based on my experience.)

FAVOR	We send our children to schools so they get quality education and become something great in future - except being a teacher. And yet one who makes them all is ignored. Irony or hypocrisy?
AGAINST	The order is arbitrary. They have banned schools from functioning and we have edtech companies like byjus and vedantu promoting it at the same time. Why these double standards?  #SaveOurSchools

FAVOR	Teachers to teach our kids.  They protect them from active shooters.  Now we're asking them to risk their lives/health to free us up to go to work?  Completely crazy.  All teachers should quit if their county forces them to teach in-person. #SchoolReopening

AGAINST	@Scaramucci Stick to stealing $$$ MASKS DON'T BLOCK VIRUSES MASKS CAUSE O2 DEPRAVATION
FAVOR	We would all feel very different about schools reopening if we had a goverment that: -Was trustworthy -Had best interest of children as only motivation  -Based on Science  -provided necessary resources to ALL schools -had a National plan   None of these is true
FAVOR	Social distancing is just a beautiful theory, learners when you turn your back they don’t practice it nor wear masks. Even teaching is not conducive, how do you avoid touching learners scripts?. Even marking class tests?

FAVOR	When @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany was pushing @realDonaldTrump's agenda to reopen schools, did I really hear her say, “The science should not stand in the way of this"?  Or am I drunk, high, in a coma...?  #kayleighlies #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpKillsUs  #MAGA
FAVOR	@FitzTrubey @ajc @CherokeeSchools start Aug 3 with masks merely “encouraged”. Irresponsible &amp; reckless to the staff, teachers, students &amp; all their families. Social distancing in middle/high schools is not even practical in classrooms or hallways. #ScienceMatters #FactsMatter
FAVOR	WHY ARENT U CLOSING SCHOOL FOR CORONA VIRUS. No primary children with weak immune sustem needs this wtf
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump And so many without masks!  Wtf, people?
FAVOR	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids!
AGAINST	@RahulGandhi The priority of any government should be to provide education to students and not shutting it down. By shutting down schools &amp; online classes,the @CMOGuj government will make Teachers &amp; schools fall into debt trap.The adverse impact of such a move is multifaceted.
FAVOR	@jwgop @realDonaldTrump If it’s so safe to send the kids,teachers, staff back to closed rooms, then why is the WH STILL testing everyone that comes in? Why isn’t the WH open for tours?

FAVOR	@TrumpWarRoom @weijia Not the science is in the way to reopen: the virus is! Very little evidence &amp; data because kids are not tested that much! They get infected or are asymptomatic carriers. In EU: small groups, alternated classes, masks &amp; washing hands, not before September 1.
AGAINST	@RichardGrenell @FoxNewsSunday @realDonaldTrump needs to have a conversation with this guy. You can't open schools until you open the country back up as well. Govenors like @GavinNewsom are ruining lives.

FAVOR	How is the situation at your end ? #Covid_19  #StaySafe #StayAtHome
AGAINST	@MartinSLewis @EndUKLockdown1 Whichever side of the fence u sit on, this lockdown is bollocksing small independent stores. Shops that rely on browsing &amp; comparing 1 shop to another. Chain stores can survive these restrictions, but social distancing is cancerous for any other types of shops.
FAVOR	@NYCSchools won’t close because parents can’t afford to lose working hours or will struggle to find childcare and some students eat their main meals at school. The system is broken and ultimately there may be some serious consequences down the road. #COVID19

FAVOR	Wearing masks during the pandemic is obviously a necessity, and those that aren't are just selfish or moronic. I wear a neck gaiter mask and it doesn't bother me at all, in fact it makes me feel better (probably due to my anxiety) - Am I alone in feeling that way?
AGAINST	Since when is a virus with a 99.7% survival rate a pandemic? Since 2020? Since Democrats figured out they have not one viable candidate to offer America? Since the Swamp started to drain? Since the NWO cabal was exposed by @realDonaldTrump?

NONE	@gordongekko369 @Molly_NYC @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump No it doesn’t. A case means positive individual. The number of tests is tracked separately. Positives aren’t higher because of testing, but because more people are sick, super genius. Ffs, you can’t be this daft.

AGAINST	the wire in masks is full of 5G waves which are causing the corona virus to spread
FAVOR	@WCTVHudak @WCTV Suspending the season is a tough solution - it is also the right one. We have to take whatever preventative steps we can to be around for each other next season. And if we are safe, we will have a next season.

AGAINST	@Solution911 Piss off martyr. You take blood you're not a brain surgeon. Stop talking crap about masks.  We have a right to choose.

AGAINST	@2020Visions3 why don't we have a split. Mon, Wed, Fri for the mask wearers to go to shops (they'd need 3 potentials before they plucked up courage to go out) &amp; Tue, Thur for non mask wearers. Sat &amp; Sun can be free choice days. It would add the insanity of it all

FAVOR	@therecount Sending children to school during a deadly #COVID19 pandemic, is worse than putting your children in cars without seatbelts.  It's playing Russian Roulette with the lives of children.   It's child abuse.   #StayHome
AGAINST	Why is opening schools a political issue now? Families of kids with special needs are really struggling without school or in person services. Zoom makes my son’s sensory issues worse. Do ye want to come over and hold him while he screams? That’s the reality of it.
FAVOR	If a mask mandate could help save lives and violates the law, CHANGE! THE! LAW! NOT having the mandate could actually be helping kill people, do you really want that on your shoulders @GovRicketts? #youcandoit
AGAINST	With schools closed because they cannot afford the costs involved, and lack of stimulus of any kind, unfortunately the students will miss an important part of what they needed to normalise - the teachers @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh
NONE	@p25735 @ScottAdamsSays The experts and media portrayed Sars-cov-2 as a supernatural virus which you couldn't create immunity to, you could get a second time, would never go away (as all corona viruses do), etc. Temp check is what is done when I go for facial. Makes tons of sense. 
NONE	But y’all having a meeting via zoom.
NONE	@libertythePD @PattyArquette @CBSLA Yes, hold the OCBE accountable for passing the DANGEROUS &amp; IRRESPONSIBLE “White Paper!” Don’t let them dismiss what they’ve done! Documents have real power when they come from a sitting committee vested w/authority by the people. #Resist

NONE	The 6,666 innocent lives taken since abortion became legal, or the increase in suicide deaths from effects of lockdown gets no discussion.   Either life matters or it doesn't.   It's clear that this shower of WHO bootlickers don't give a damn about us.
FAVOR	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT
AGAINST	ONLY sick people need a mask. Wake up Americans

AGAINST	We tried #lockdown before  Proved it didn't end deaths  We tried mandatory #MasksOn  Proved it didn't end deaths  Number of cases not translating to higher death rate  The experts said 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 deaths by March 2020  Proven to be wrong every time

AGAINST	@SenKamalaHarris School closings affect poor &amp; POC who can’t afford private schools, tutors &amp; daycare. If you care about education you should demand that schools open or give vouchers for daycare, tutors or private schools. Not all kids learn online not all parents can help.

NONE	two of my international roommates aren’t coming back to school this semester because the united states is a laughing stock when it comes to coronavirus... sooo anyone wanna tell me again how they’re president is handling this situation “well”??
FAVOR	I knew my procrastination would pay off! #COVID19 will hopefully delay my A Levels
AGAINST	@BorisJohnson Never thought I’d say it Boris but for a so called ‘liberal’ conservative you are an absolute control freak! Stop babying us. Stop #nannystate and FFS stop the insane forced masks.
AGAINST	If schools are not reopening this year, can I stop paying my school taxes?
AGAINST	@ConHome @MattHancock Just stop this. Release new death stats ‘from’ COVID-19 to correct the ‘misleading’ #PHE figures. Barely any hospital admissions/deaths. NHS has spare capacity. No evidence to support mask wearing.  This virus is of no danger to vast majority of people #EndLockdown
AGAINST	@Linda36758099 Sheeple on the radio this morning complaining that the police are not fining those of us who are not wearing masks. Shit bags!
NONE	@CherokeePhoenix Follow the safe Path.
NONE	@realDonaldTrump Good morning, Mr. President! Come back to NH very soon!! :flag_for_United_States:  We’re waiting on you.
AGAINST	Dear @GavinNewsom , what exactly is the #science behind your decision to unilaterally shut down schools? That's what's supposed to drive your response, right? #antiscience
FAVOR	Please with folded hands:pray::pray::pray:, I request @sidharth_shukla  &amp; @ishehnaaz_gill to please stay safe &amp; stay home. Mumbai isn't safe anymore. We fans can wait for your projects next year but can't take chance of your health as you both are precious to us..  Please
NONE	@MRizzello @paulkrugman Arch-Traitor Trump will #sacrifice whomever he needs to, in order to win.
AGAINST	@BorisJohnson Town centres are inhospitable now &amp; will be worse once masks are compulsory. Pointless as the virus has run its course.

NONE	@chrislhayes @BradleyWhitford A president trying to cherry pick which states get to vote and by what means is the very definition of voter suppression. #TrumpVirus #WeakPresident
AGAINST	@DHSCgovuk No.  Why should we?  You use the numbers of people testing positive while being asymptomatic or not hospitalised to further the Draconian and #authoritarian stripping of freedoms and liberties.

NONE	And the COO of the board said “The science isn’t clear on masks.”  I came in hot with — Are you kidding me?!? Masks work, science proves it and other countries are better off then the US because of masks.
AGAINST	Only 3 people inside a packed Home Depot without masks on and two of them were my husband and me. No Karens reared their ugly heads but I was fully prepared for it. Not today, satan. #StandYourGround
NONE	Contact tracing of all patients are going on . Please
FAVOR	#LongCovid is real. Let's not forgot about those left behind who are still suffering. Please all be careful with lockdown slowly easing- trust your gut. If something doesn't feel right don't do it- look after yourselves as the gov won't.
FAVOR	Schools in Durham, North Carolina will be closed until after the general election November 3rd 2020. Democrats in Durham are science deniers.
FAVOR	@twobluecats I couldn’t agree more! #DeVosKillsChildren #DeVosMustGo #KeepSchoolsClosed
NONE	Parents need to prepare for the possibility that schools will call the police and/or CPS in the event that they don’t bring their kids to school. Idk if they’ll keep it up, what with the pandemic, but they def did it in SETX (pre-covid) 
NONE	@business Dear #QAnon ! First amend the #racist laws ! Try 2 skip selfishness in dealing with the #coronavirus pandemic !  The Zionists of th Congress have killed thousands of #Americans because #Trump found it shameful to change his mind about the necessity of wearing a mask!
AGAINST	They lost me on effectiveness of masks working when they release prisoners, mostly convicted pedophiles,  from prison instead of providing them masks.  #WWG1GWA
NONE	I’ve just played UNO for the first time ever :grimacing:! #uno #games #kids #family #fun
AGAINST	The mask can only help for so long!  After you fiddle with it for 30 seconds, it’s pretty much ineffective. So just stay away from me! :grinning:

NONE	Dollar store Shia LaBeouf needs to calm the hell down in the:  @Facebook Anti-Vax/Covidiot Post Of The Now  #Covidiots
NONE	What the US is doing right now is akin to a cancer patient that tells the doctors he/she will wait for the disease to progress before taking action. Time to wake up.  #coronavirus #COVID19
NONE	@DonaldJTrumpJr   If a healthy person is diagnosed with #coronavirus and dies from any other cause, like hit by a bus or anything, our state government counts that as a #Covid19 death.   These numbers are so damn flawed.   Very frustrating.   #GOP
AGAINST	@lydbloo @Lordgreyofponty It's had the opposite effect though. Visited 3 towns at the weekend, mask free, and saw few shoppers out and even fewer inside the shops. Ghost town in most apart from the cafes. They seemed to be doing better.
NONE	:notes::arrow_forward:Zoom @iamSlimCase   On #Totorimuzik @Djitchyfingazz #spinning:repeat_one: LISTENLIVEON #OURAPPONPLAYSTORE AND #WEBSITEONBIO
AGAINST	There are normally around 280k deaths/yr in Canada.  Of those usually 8000 or so are from flu/pneumonia. As of today 8773 have died from or "with" Covid-19. How many have died of "regular" flu? How many EXTRA will die from lack of care/diagnosis due to lockdown?
FAVOR	As a form of protest, I am not provide and "likes" to my friends social media posts where they are socializing without a #mask. I know I will probably lose friends over this difficult decision. #MaskUp
AGAINST	@McMasterU @WHO @dkchu @schunemann_mac @TheLancet @HEI_mcmaster WHO lied to the world; led a coverup to please Chinese Communist Party Masters! NO danger of COVID-19 transmission! WHO now has zero credibility. Dr Fauci told us not to wear masks back in March. Fauci now calls on people to wear masks. Fauci has zero credibility too.
AGAINST	@TXMagaMan Don't let them have the satisfaction of creating division and racial tension that does not exist in this country. It is a distraction to keep us from fighting for our freedom. #endthelockdown
FAVOR	We've either had huge numbers cured of whatever illness that prevented them from wearing masks or the stick is working.  Very noticeable increase in compliance this morning in Limerick.  
NONE	I would love to be a particle of paint on many a meeting room wall  #covid19 #Coronavirus
AGAINST	so nice finding some new mask free hangs :relieved: it's nice to be treated like a human again
FAVOR	@RightWingWatch Not only did everyone in the church wear a mask ALL THREE PRESIDENTS in attendance wore masks too
AGAINST	@KateBolduan @CNN But make no mistake. Wearing a mask is UNHEALTHY and makes society as a whole more susceptible to more illnesses and viruses, causing individuals to chronically inhale what their own bodies are trying to expel.
FAVOR	@RightWingWatch What if, stay with me on this, the mask wasn't an affront to his freedom, but a statement about his compassion for others.  Also, he's f***ing idiot and we'd appreciate it if people like him didn't wrap their ignorance in our flag.
AGAINST	Where was the opposition to wearing masks in @BBCNewsnight ? A Tory lord and a  Labour MP both supporting to yet more restrictions on our liberty in the name of public safety
FAVOR	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO.
FAVOR	141 days into the US #COVID19 pandemic. With all the information we have about the benefit of wearing #masks, if you aren’t, you are responsible for the continued spread, deaths, illness, closures, financial ruin, and ongoing horror!
AGAINST	@Beth2002 @KeepAmericaFre4 @ChuckCallesto Let them. I just smile at them and am always polite...drives them even more crazy.   A lot of folks I know admitted they don't believe in the "science", they just wear one because it eases the fear of others. I call BS. Masks perpetuate the fear.
NONE	@DeAnna4Congress @cathibrgnr58 Too bad these Governor’s didn’t worry more about the rioters ,the vandalism going on &amp; Stop releasing felons.They can take their mask and shove them! #NoMasks

NONE	@SpeakerPelosi @RepDanKildee @RepRichardNeal @RepDannyDavis Back to work!
NONE	A late start to my #GTD #WeeklyReview but any clarity, peace, and moments of reflection are welcome ones.
FAVOR	@dougducey It is unsafe to open schools in 4 weeks.   We can almost guarantee you will not follow the science but follow Trump down the rabbit hole again.  This time you can take that trip alone.
FAVOR	The only constitutional right your mask is violating is your right to get sick and die.  Wear a mask you fucking ape.
NONE	Across India, a whole spectrum of parents and the government have taken to systematic outrage and criticising of school's charging fees in the lockdown period. They say the phones, laptops and broadband charges are expensive and unnecessary.
AGAINST	@GavinNewsom @TheEllenShow That is exactly why I don't wear a MASK. I will not be a subject for your #science pandemic  I'm tough, I'm ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch.....okay, guilty as charged  #MyBodyMyRules #MyBodyMyChoice
AGAINST	Not all mask work. But any mask will do. No logic. #CONformity
AGAINST	@WeAreTheMillies Employees shouldn't have to be enforcing masks. Aggressive Karens usually harass shoppers for not wearing a mask...:grimacing:  Stores need to remove those stupid one way aisle floor markers too. Another thing to be scolded for while shopping. :face_with_rolling_eyes: #NoMasks
NONE	@japantimes @mrjamesob Japan upping their game. But let's all argue about wearing a mask.
NONE	@MorrisseyHelena @hughosmond @allisonpearson Sorry what, shops and pubs to close to allow schools to re-open. Link? Anyone? Does not compute. Economy destroyed, healthcare destroyed, education destroyed.Lies-check. Totalitarianism - check.More deaths as a result of lockdown compared to coronavirus -check.
FAVOR	@DWUhlfelderLaw @Surgeon_General And evidently today according to our "leader", there is a decline. Lies, lies, lies. No testing over weekend so of course the numbers are down. I don't need a math degree to figure that out. But #DeathSantis got pat on back for job well done
AGAINST	@chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump PLEASE expose #firefauci Birx and CDC !  The truth about this Virus needs to be told.  They’re all #DeepState .  WE know they’re hiding behind “scientist” cover!  Why not private sector Dr’s speak at a presser?!  And
NONE	@SenSchumer It is all about cases for @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN not deaths. Deaths are down. That’s good news!!!
AGAINST	Guess who's going to be hurt the most by keeping schools closed? Ding... ding... ding.... all they want to do is keep the divide and keep the classes separated.

AGAINST	Dear Teachers, I guarantee there are worse germs in our classrooms than #COVID19 and yet we still signed up for this job.
AGAINST	@CoachStokowski Reason 912 we should open schools and play sports. What else needs to be stated.
FAVOR	What’s wrong with people? Ware a mask and stay the heck away from others. It’s pretty easy! #COVIDIOTS #PhysicalDistancing #StopTheSpread #FactsNotFear #WashYourHands
AGAINST	This virus response has been the most disproportionate reaction to anything I’ve seen in...ever
NONE	@ResproUK These masks have exhalation valves; they should not be allowed on #publictransport against #Covid_19.  
NONE	@migga When I heard 2pm..  I sighed. 200 is still bad but not the 500 i was expecting with a 2pm presser.
NONE	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light
FAVOR	@Reuters @WritesMore Guess they were too busy watching @FoxNewsSunday to have seen the video of the man who refused to wear a mask, tested positive, died with regret over his bad decision. 
NONE	@johnhollinger Correct. @GovKemp @BrianKempGA is Pro Life, but Anti-#WearAMask #ExecutiveOrder (aka Pro Death).
FAVOR	@JustinAHorwitz @ReallyAmerican1 Science should not stand in the way of opening our schools. But I guarantee you, this virus will shut them down permanently.
NONE	I’m really fearing all the news of #COVID19 outbreaks and parents and teachers dying once schools open.  Please everyone- be safe.
AGAINST	@bryttan77 @Kektex @annetteymacdon1 @freetheJays @WhiteCrkLumber The people are brainwashed. Magic masks will save lives. GARBAGE!
AGAINST	@MartinBenLee1 Many scientists around the world (who are not being paid to lie) are saying that this is the worlds biggest over-reaction to a virus. But Govts. have taken control of every aspect of life &amp; they are not going to relinquish this power unless we make them. #nomasks
NONE	Can someone please do a "Downfall" parody of the mask situation? Long overdue if it hasn't been done yet. #downfall
NONE	The order, even if aimed at populism, is ill informed and ill thought out. It does not help anyone. It just perpetuates the inevitable collapse of hundreds and possibly thousands of schools in the coming months. #SaveOurSchools #education @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj
FAVOR	@joshi_speaks @zoneanthony @anubha1812 I think best option for parents who are not satisfied with online classes is to shift to government schools or take a drop of one year. Many parents are happy with the online classes and let them take the advantage of it.
FAVOR	How did we get to the greatest public health failure of our time?  Months ago Americans were asked to wear a mask to save a life.  Not enlist, not run into a burning building, simply wear a mask.  And America said "No".    
FAVOR	@Acosta So I guess trumpedo administration is abolishing science in schools. Cuz what it’s the point to teach children science if adults (not all of them but the stupid ones) don’t believe in it. Anyway my daughter is NOT going to face to face school this fall.
FAVOR	@pjhelliar Turned up to our worksite to paint yesterday. 6 concreters, 2 chippies, 2 pool blokes, all without masks on and working in the one area. We walked off site and got eyes rolled at us and laughed at.

NONE	While picking up "essentials" at the store today, I noticed that they have a good stock of "novelty" masks. All made in China.  Why is China profiting from their misdeeds?  #BuyAmerican 
FAVOR	Work from home should really just become the norm this year.  At work people dont wear masks or maintain social distance and the urge to throw a tantrum and swearing at such #COVIDIOTS is making me crazy.
FAVOR	Look at all these people at @NASA and @SpaceX doing their jobs, keeping @Astro_Doug &amp; @AstroBehnken safe and informed while social distancing and wearing masks. You guys rock. :rocket::man_astronaut: :adult:‍:rocket::sauropod: :earth_americas:

AGAINST	Due to Covid-19, the country was in lockdown state.  Private institutions are badly suffering including their faculty staff and students.
FAVOR	An estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die annually of flu-related causes worldwide. In 7 months, 673,833 #Covid_19 deaths have been reported so far. Sources: WHO and Johns Hopkins #WearAMask

NONE	@Shazia We all have to live with it. May be a year, two or lifetime. We need not to be #COVIDIOTS
NONE	School is said to be our 2 home. If home needs to maintained than even schools need maintenance. No fees is no solution.
FAVOR	Today I realized if the solution to climate change was for everyone to just wear a mask, we would still fail. #ClimateCrisis #freedom
AGAINST	Went to the dr today for a regular check up - apt time at 2pm. Arrive at the same time as 4 other patients. I check in 2nd. Everyone else got called back. Not me. Half an hour later, someone else shows up. They get called back. Still not me. I'm the only one with no mask.
AGAINST	The death rate of COVID-19 is just barely causing more deaths than the flu currently, according to statistic sources that notoriously inflate COVID-19 counts.   But no, we'll keep everything locked down at least until, oh, I don't know, I'd say maybe... November
FAVOR	Covid-19 cases rise so highly meanwhile the people awareness of Covid-19 has been rapidly going down at the low level. Whenever I went outside, I saw most people didn't wear mask. That also indicate how people stupidity is rapidly going up at the high level

NONE	@ReginahMhaule @DBE_SA  The @CyrilRamaphosa announcement that public school will close means that private schools remain open? Theoretically yes, is the ministry saying that there's no #COVID19 in private schools? #schools
FAVOR	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this.
AGAINST	Teachers Unions are just lazy siphons of tax payers money as they fight against opening schools when ALL scientific and rational data point to the fact that schools need to Open this Fall.
NONE	Today 10th March 2020 in Greece all schools closed for 14 days.  Today in Italy 168 humans died due to #Coronavirus #Covid19 .
FAVOR	I guess I should’ve know any effort to flatten the curve that depended on an overwhelming majority of Americans to refrain from being self-centered was doomed to fail.
AGAINST	What’s up with @VP sounding like a democrat? He’s been hanging with Fauci too long!!!  #NoMasks
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto Nope-do ‘experts’ take into account that humans need oxygen. Breathing carbon dioxide is bad. And this WuFlu may be contagious, but no where near as deadly as officials claimed. Numbers are falsified as they include people not tested and/or died of other causes.
AGAINST	@SarahTa71922357 @mgalvers @gmpolice Yeah, just open pubs &amp; clubs as it was before.
FAVOR	Just got word that my coworker tested positive for covid-19. He was anti mask and went to parties without any care for the people around him. Now because of him I'm scared for my life.  Please for the love of god, #WearAMask
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto The Wuhan virus is now weaker than the seasonal flu. There are inexpensive, treatments. A vaccine is only a Big Pharma money maker. Masks are dangerous, they cause health issues. This is America, I don't need or want the Govt to make these decisions for me.
AGAINST	@ClarkeMicah @Charlotte3003G Peter is a voice of reason and sensibility. #FakePandemic
NONE	At the supermarket today I saw people make jokes about social distancing before giving each other a hug. This is not a hoax - take it seriously to protect everyone. #COVID19
FAVOR	They shouldn't open the school.. keep it online and donate some laptops and some wifi.
FAVOR	@PennsylvaniaGov @GovernorTomWolf Thank you for doing all you can to help more people accept that wearing a #mask is one simple way to  help stop the spread - and isn’t difficult! #JustWearIt #Masks
FAVOR	I don’t get why they are waiting for coronavirus to get to schools before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the schools so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it
NONE	@SpeakerPelosi Well, you're still a dimwit #COVIDIOTS

NONE	@Zee24Kalak @DixitGujarat Do you think its right for the Gujarat Government to stop Private UnAided Schools from charging any fees till they reopen, while teachers are teaching online?  Looking forward to hear your thoughts?
NONE	Wake up India &amp; decide what you want for your schools: Thrive or Die? Gujarat Govt order banning schools from charging legitimate fee for online learning is short sighted populism. We need leadership, not knee jerk reactions. @CMOGuj @PMOIndia @imBhupendrasinh
NONE	@abcperth @GeoffHutchison I cannot believe you are giving people like this air time. FFS, is she aware there is a global pandemic and the US is one of the worst affected? Do better, this is pathetic
AGAINST	@ChoagChrs @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @replouiegohmert @realDonaldTrump Then you should put on 2 masks to double your protection because most of are not going to be forced to wear one because you're scared!

FAVOR	2) We as Sadtu want schools to close because of the Standard Operating Procedures are not being implemented consistently across provinces. Schools are operating on autopilot and acting outside the SOP. We won't even get to social inequalities
AGAINST	@GovWhitmer, @gretchenwhitmer is expected to stricken her #Mask laws today, hilariously enough, this is what we need. She will keep digging herself deeper, when if she was in the real talks of Michigan, and not in her high tower of exemption. #maskoff
AGAINST	@MotorMouth1964 @myhollycat @markinneswilli Have you considered @myhollycat, operations requiring gen anaesthetic require intubation?

AGAINST	@wjordan256 Let me guess if George Floyd would have had a mask on he'd still be alive.
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump My 2 teenage sisters, my nephews and many more did not learn one thing since the schools closed here in California. The only 2 children I knew that their teachers actually taught them something was two 7 year olds; one in California and the other in Colombia.

AGAINST	@WaltDisneyWorld stop trying to get people to visot the parks with the BS specials you are running. As long as you have the BS facemask rule your bottom line is going to suffer. We will not allow you to make $$. Get rid of the crazy ass rule and we will.once again visit.
FAVOR	Public schools will start out with remote learning at the beginning of the school year here in North Texas.  Private schools have not made the same announcement.  So my kid will not be saturated in neither COVID nor smug privilege while learning this year.
AGAINST	I know schools that've closed 3 times in the last 30 days. Such stunts are emotionally draining &amp; traumatizing to learners. They hinder effective learning, to make matters worse most matrics are taught using smartboards which are now affected by loadshedding
AGAINST	The hassle and pointless wearing of masks has pushed us to online shopping with Ocado.

FAVOR	@GovParsonMO  Your CALLOUS attitude on #SchoolReopening, not caring kids, teachers, family will get &amp; spread virus is deplorable!  You forgot we're the SHO-ME STATE. You're not showing good leadership or #facts that Missouri spread &amp; deaths won't get worse!
AGAINST	@TDEM @GovAbbott The reporting is so messed up, NO ONE knows the REAL numbers! What is a fact is that treatment is working and we need to

FAVOR	Every school in the area has cancelled classes or went online while @WWU is just waiting until AFTER we have a COVID-19 case when it’s very clear we have multiple on campus. We have students who actually work at these nursing homes which are at VERY HIGH risk.
AGAINST	Let schools proceed akere kids are stronger
FAVOR	Learning should be constant...then . Why not in covid situation ? Teachers are learning new ways, technology to reach out all the students .... Students have also  accepted the change to learn through virtual classes.... Schools should be on and on and on
FAVOR	@Starbucks I went to Starbucks at 2961 Michelson Dr, Irvine, CA 92612 at 1:30 pm today. Cashier and the girl at order pick up counter were not wearing face mask. This seems not implementing California order. #Starbucks 
NONE	@Tges_Official Parents should have a right to choose the format of their children's education, especially in such uncertain times. We don't know when #schools will open, so there have to exist various avenues for children to continue their #education
FAVOR	#Singapore has a 95% nationwide #mask compliance. Approx 55% of US citizens are wearing masks. As an example, Singapore has a population density 41 times higher than Maricopa County AZ, but has less than half the number of #Covid_19 cases. #WearAMask
AGAINST	I've been in online college classes. All yall are about to get dumb as fuck. #COVID19 #coronavirus

FAVOR	A face mask in not impeding your everyday life. I just went into a sandwich shop and a sausage bap, wearing a face covering. It's so simple...
AGAINST	@javadisciple @supitsshekinah This is why I don’t wear it. If I was told “we aren’t sure about the total effectiveness, but it will cut down on spread, and we are asking you to make a sacrifice and wear a mask” I’d be all for it. But no one is leveling with others like free adults so
AGAINST	@GovMikeDeWine If someone wants to wear a mask, that is their choice. If they don’t want to, it’s also their choice. #freeohio

AGAINST	I’m so sick of the mask bullshit, it makes everywhere you go more depressing  #NoMaskMandates
FAVOR	@Patriotize Yep masks only worn in the O.R. and infection contagion risk areas of high risk patients. And they were not these cheap ass blue and white paper masks they were N95 respirator masks. :pray::flag_for_United_States::heart::frog:
AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump That is not what they said. And you know that. They want schools to open safely ONLY if the spread of COVID-19 in an area is under CONTROL. But given the GOP and this administration’s completely botched response in handling this pandemic, that will NOT be possible.
AGAINST	@BCGovNews We absolutely can do better.  Let's talk about the addictions &amp; overdoses, the jobs and businesses lost, the depression &amp; anxiety, the fiscal irresponsibility, the perverse incentives paying people more to stay home than work...  Do better...
FAVOR	I am sick to death of you selfish fuckers openly defying store policy and walking around with no mask and daring  someone to challenge you. To the teen whose father dragged her into his narcissism, I apologize for my language. But fuck you too.
NONE	If government has problem with private schools, why central government is privatising sole of its companies? It is because privatization brings decipline and efficiency in system. If government wants to earn money, why not schools?
FAVOR	The Trump Cult can send their children to school because obviously they are not to smart, but SMART Americans are NOT sending our children to the SUPER SPREADER schools. Absolutely RIDICULOUS for politicians to expect this while the virus is out of control!!!
NONE	@DrTommyJohnDC Thank You!! The Numbers everyone needs to see..

NONE	@eorden Well that was in June .... now they have new cases  
FAVOR	Now stop calling them schools, colleges, universities because they are test centers now. You have to teach at home &amp; schools just to rate excellent, good, poor. Honestly, I am speaking after experience of children education. Therefore, make everything online.
AGAINST	I have noticed that especially millennials see these face mask thing as a trendy one. Different colour, style. How pathetic is that?

AGAINST	@theage Okay so we move to stage 4. That will fail. What next? Stage 5? What if no vaccine is ever found? Are we going to hideout forever? This response is devoid of all logic
AGAINST	This #Covidtesting is so corrupt it is just a sham. Now its like testing for DNA. Fo you have DNA? If yes, you have CoVid19. Pathetic. The numbers are made up.  Masks never helped and Sweden never locked down. They're over it. We should be too.
FAVOR	@Hope012015 The rage in this country over absolutely idiotic and (in the grand scheme) minute things...:exploding_head:. Just wear the damn mask.
FAVOR	Y’all, wearing a mask is great. I can mouth the words to the weird song I have in my head and no one looks at me funny.

FAVOR	“A major teachers union in Los Angeles says the district can’t re-open schools until there is a ‘moratorium’ on charter schools."   With good reason. Charter schools do not protect teachers, refuse troubled students, drain money and talent from our school system.

NONE	@EricDJuly Translation: Grandma touched her face after opening a door. Grandma didn't wash her hands. Grandma had a pre existing condition.  Why wasn't Grandma social distancing?  FEAR IS NOT A VIRTUE

NONE	Please leave the political B/S aside.  If you have kids 6th grade or under would you send them to school? #vote 
AGAINST	Unions vow to shut schools down as Covid-19 continues to claim teacher's lives.   Should these unions be successful and schools are closed, do you think that teachers should still receive their full salaries and why?
NONE	@thecjpearson They need mail in voting. In order to accomplish that they need to instill fear and keep schools and universities closed.
NONE	Prediction: Trump will claim that he invented face masks -- "the best masks ever" -- saving millions of lives. 
FAVOR	@josephcollins77 @davidmweissman @WhirledCitizen_ A lot of this is arrogance. And arrogance is the final form of stupidity which, in the case of #COVID19 denial, is frequently a death sentence.
FAVOR	@9NewsMelb @VictoriaPolice @DanielAndrewsMP if we have road blocks we need to be able to enforce them.  @9NewsMelb you are just encouraging others. Stop advertising the selfish people that are disobeying rules and restrictions which are keeping us locked down.
AGAINST	Someone needs to do a study on how many ardent mask-wears got COVID-19 since we all know (including the government) that masks don’t work.
