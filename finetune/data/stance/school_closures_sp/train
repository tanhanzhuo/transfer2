AGAINST	@Manny_Alicandro We all must be unmasked.
FAVOR	@CMag051 It’s very scary to see how many people aren’t wearing masks or social distancing. We all need to do our part. It’s not that hard.
AGAINST	@lydbloo @Lordgreyofponty It's had the opposite effect though. Visited 3 towns at the weekend, mask free, and saw few shoppers out and even fewer inside the shops. Ghost town in most apart from the cafes. They seemed to be doing better.
AGAINST	@MattHancock @NHSX You idiots just don't learn do you? Or do you think we're gold fish? "predictive tech" is a euphemism for modelling and that was sooo accurate last time wasn't it. STOP WASTING MY TAXES! Undo the unjust lockdown now.

AGAINST	@johnrobertsFox #Fauci is full of shit!  His mask was down and he was talking away with someone unrelated less than 6 feet away.  Plus, the way he handled his mask isn't the "standard" way.  Touching the front and spreading everything the mask caught.

FAVOR	@thehill We aren’t in the clear. This will not “magically disappear.” Science is our arsenal, Fauci is our Patton.  The premature drive for normalcy-to send children to school-will be an historic, irresponsible strategy. Not until there is a vaccine are we safe.
FAVOR	Does it do any good to put a sign on a door if you don’t enforce it.  I went into the @PilotFlyingJ in Flatwoods, WV &amp; only 1 out of 5 customers had a mask on.  It’s hard to enforce though when the manager hangs her mask under her chin.

FAVOR	In March our amazing backyard neighbor died from COVID-19. Today I’m watching people (thankfully wearing masks) go through all his stuff as part of an estate sale. It’s all so sad. If we had shut down earlier, he would likely still be here.
AGAINST	The death rate of COVID-19 is just barely causing more deaths than the flu currently, according to statistic sources that notoriously inflate COVID-19 counts.   But no, we'll keep everything locked down at least until, oh, I don't know, I'd say maybe... November

AGAINST	@MtnMD @laurajo82878461 @FreeThinkMind @DrKellyVictory @kksheld @drdavidsamadi People who make kids wear masks while their immune system develops will be responsible for many many illnesses and deaths later. It’s child abuse.

NONE	@thomaskaine5 No way. Closed spaces with air/particles recirculating and shops with close contact (salons, etc)? Defies logic. So, you want to risk your life to touch up your roots? Hell no. Salons were innovating and selling kits with your formula and guiding over zoom.#COVID19 #DrFauci

FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump Look at all you assholes not wearing a mask.
FAVOR	I was talking to my 4 year old about why wearing a mask is important. She replied “But I like my mask. I don’t even mind wearing it.”  This from a kid with sensory issues who has refused to even wear any shirts facing forward for the past 6 months. #medtwitterkids
NONE	@Tennessean If it’s too dangerous to go eat/drink on Broadway even 6-12ft from others, go eat even with a mask after 10 PM (unless rioting, looting shoe stores, or burning the historic courthouse) it’s probably too dangerous to go vote.  It’s either safe or it’s not.

FAVOR	@tedlieu I have a terrible feeling the expected death toll from #COVID19 #coronavirus will be revised higher again, after it was just reduced last week to 60k. Not sure if it was a political stunt. Clearly #hydroxychloriquine isn’t working; false claims. #DrFauci was right.

The only reason why my state (and some others) had high deaths is b/c the Governors sent sick elderly ppl into nursing homes!  Our Governors are more dangerous to us than Covid!
AGAINST	@OregonGovBrown I find it disturbing that at the beginning of the outbreak we had a month of lectures on how masks don't work, especially many from Dr. Fauci and I am wondering how anyone has any faith in him knowing he lied.  Random cloth coverings are not going to stop the spread

AGAINST	@JosephJFlynn1 Absolutely. I'm sure someone who does this sort of thing can go back and count how many times @realDonaldTrump raised this and how many times Fauci dismissed it and how many scathing stories MSM had on it. @IngrahamAngle was on top of this from start.
AGAINST	@DisavowTrump20 Fauci is the devil, and he should be locked up in jail for treason.
AGAINST	@AndyBurnhamGM This is just crazy, wear a mask because this virus is so deadly but #EatOutToHelpOut you couldn't make this up and #COVIDIOT are still doing as their told!

AGAINST	@CDCgov needs to answer some questions,  since their "guidelines" are wreaking havoc on our country. Before, Fauci said no need to wear masks before since he "wanted to save them for med staff". Does that mean he no longer cares if med staff have masks? Why not??

AGAINST	Oh, the irony…  Phantom of the Opera, you know, the one with the MASK, is being canned!!!
AGAINST	The argument of 'wearing a mask is like wearing pants in public' is not even close to making sense. Since when did pants inhibit your ability to breathe? Do pants cause anxiety attacks? Do pants limit oxygen and make you breathe in CO2 and bacteria? #donotcomply

FAVOR	When the virus 1st arrived, I heard get a mask. Went to look for 1 and they were nowhere to be found. I got shamed for trying to buy one. Now I've come to the conclusion that the mask is part of the psyop and not really protection. Now I get shamed for not wearing one.

FAVOR	@charliekirk11 People in the streets wear masks
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump You know why, stupid? They wear masks, wash their hands, stay 6’ from each other &amp; follow #DrFauci’s suggestions which you don’t.  Tell Americans to do the right thing &amp; schools will have no trouble opening. Pay attention to people smarter than you! There are many!
AGAINST	@xoKaylaNicole @QANONRealNews The fact that you have a health issue that should legitimately keep you from wearing a mask, yet you will go so far as to judge one's Christianity for not wearing one seems odd to me - like your brain is turned off and you can't think for yourself.

NONE	@Ilhan These tweets are exactly why we won’t. #Resistance

NONE	I wish these so-called elite doctors would not only advise #SocialDistancing but also help people understand how to build up their immune systems but oh no, all they wanna push is big pharma vaccines.

NONE	It hurts to say “no” — but it hurts much less than the potentially heartbreaking fatal consequences.
AGAINST	Wearing a mask to stop the spread of Covid is the equivalent of adding a chain link fence to stop mosquitoes from coming in your yard.

FAVOR	What's the meaning behind the #fauciwink? #supportpublichealth #wearamask
AGAINST	@IngrahamAngle @KathyMillerDC @bigleaguepol This is because he positioned to profit immensely from a vaccine. When was the last time #Fauci treated a patient? Answer... decades! He needs to be prosecuted for causing the deaths of thousands of Americans?

AGAINST	@ramcct @JohmBoFlavin @RichardGrenell This is how the #DeepState gets us... they realize that the majority of America, and in this case, the globe, has a short-term memory.

AGAINST	It's time to investigate #DrFauci he has a conflict of interest having his own lab producing a drug that competes with #Hidroxicloroquina it's no wonder he opposed this drug WHICH HAS SAVED THOUDANDS OF LIVES from almost death from #COVID19. I think he is a sham.

FAVOR	@IngrahamAngle Fixed it for you: Democrats #WearAMask &amp; are #SociallyDistant.  Republicans who ignore medical experts, like #DrFauci, will spread #COVID19 and potentially harm themselves and others.   You can't wish #COVID19 away, but you can mitigate the deaths.  #FactsMatter #ScienceMatters
NONE	@the_hindu I want to give a suggestion about covid-19. My idea is to arrange the  audio SPEAKERS to each and every Area or Street, which is used to Spread the news about Covid or about any disasters. It helps  people to know about situation and to alert them .

FAVOR	@RhapsoDani I hope quarantine doesn’t mean you don’t get out for walks almost daily, which is good for you &amp; critical for kids; if you social distance it doesn’t present a serious risk. Those w underlying conditions should be able to get a KN95 mask, which protects the wearer 
AGAINST	@JedediahBila The propaganda around this virus is off the charts.
AGAINST	LI’m no longer going to put up w this crap with the masks at PATH MEDICAL. I had a mask on, certified by the CDC!!! And they told me I need one of the ‘other ones’. Now we’re dictating which masks you can wear? These people are sick!

FAVOR	@fiestabuckeye1 @Sharman6642 @TheGoodLiars Not true. Also, there is currently a vaccine for the flu. Why are you trying to minimize this pandemic? People are dying every minute in this country because the federal government is leaderless and has politicized the one thing that could mitigate it.
FAVOR	@weijia @CBSNews @DanScavino @Scavino45 More maturity from the ‘leaders’ I see.  Fauci , like any other scientist goes with the facts AT THAT TIME.  we can’t get people to wear a mask but they’ll second guess one of the greatest minds on infectious disease..  Dumb in the extreme.
FAVOR	@SueDeWitt4 @Ann_Isik @GinaEllis4 @Lezlie61 @CorporatePiggie @ricball I don’t understand these people who will not wear a mask :mask:. Inconsiderate fools.
NONE	Public schools taught me science.  Public schools taught me math.  Public schools taught me government.   So here goes:  Wearing a mask reduces the spread of COVID-19.  135,000 have died. More will die.  Our President should be voted out.
AGAINST	@CNN Can someone stop Dr Fraudi talking? He's caused enough pain and suffering. 17m without jobs so far... #coronavirus
FAVOR	— frickin’ idea what they’re talking about and how people like her are part of the problem. Sure, masks aren’t the cure for #COVID19 . But it certainly helps in being a preventative from the spread of the virus. So, again, #WearAMaskPlease.
FAVOR	@GOPLeader So 9 out of 10 members of Congress with Covid-19 is a Republican. Doesn’t that antidotal added to science tell you something? Covid-19 doesn’t care about your politics but the politics of the Republican Party have made it worse.
AGAINST	@KHerriage @UrUnpaidPundit @charliebilello Yep. But we are still barring children from playgrounds - welding gates, filling skateparks with sand. Insane. Almost zero risk to them #LetTheChildrenPlay Love the children- let them go #BacktoSchool  #MAGA

NONE	@ConCaracal The electorate is more desperate to keep their homes and children fed than to keep @CyrilRamaphosa and his @MYANC thugs accountable. Keeping the electorate down keeps the ANC in power. Anger is redirected to the ghosts of the past. Wash, rinse, repeat.

AGAINST	Anyone supporting an extended lockdown to “save lives” is an absolute hypocrite. What about the deaths and lives severely impacted by the lockdown, eg unemployment and poverty, suspension of organ transplants or dental care, no schools, abuse, mental health etc
AGAINST	@GPizzaRaccoon How long should we stay locked down for?  Until the number of deaths from the lockdown (suicide, overdose, depression, lack of medical care, abuse, starvation, etc) passes the number of deaths from #covid19?  Or is there some other magical number of days?  
AGAINST	Because once we get to HIT, even high-risk individuals bear little risk! And yes, COVID19 will come back each year, but each return will have materially less impact. In fact, it most likely will simply become the fifth coronavirus to cause the common cold.
NONE	@RomanCabanac It is about time we stood together against the ANC, DA IFP &amp; EFF Please share &amp; get more people involved. This opposition &amp; resistance needs to be National.

FAVOR	@AusDebater @JVartndesign @jillastark No, we have vaccines for the plague.  And antibiotics. COVID19 is a virus (antibiotics don't work) and there is no vaccine yet.  If not for modern hygiene, hospital care, ventilators and of course social distancing, this virus would be killing many more.
FAVOR	@JonLemire #DrFauci should tell @realDonaldTrump the @WhiteHouse to pound rocks and go straight to hell.  He won't, he's got too much class. Me on the other hand would tell every last one of them to go fuck themselves. #COVID19 #70days #TheBodyBagPresident #TrumpDeathToll137K #TrumpVirus

AGAINST	Why are @Surgeon_General and #DrFauci both so insistent that masks should be mandated by local and state governments? When did doctors weigh in on federal vs state rights? Do your jobs - report the facts and give medical guidance. Not constitutional law analysis.
FAVOR	On the other hand, with masks it's fun to mouth the most vile, hateful shit directly to someone's face when they Karen you for standing too close at TSA.

AGAINST	I've been noticing a trend lately -- people are breaking out with acne and infections all over their faces from the mask usage. And that is just the tip of the iceberg of the potential effects of masks. The CDC &amp; Fauci are evil.
FAVOR	In the midst of a pandemic that's already killed 60,000 in the UK, we need a formal medical exemption process around #Masks not just something anyone can download. This would protect the few who genuinely can't wear them, and ensure those who can DO.

AGAINST	@John_Sevigny We are finished with Fauci.   We are finished with him dictating the future of America and our freedoms.  We are finished with his 24/7 fear porn and false projections.  And he STILL has yet to mention the most common sense ways to boost your immune system.  Seriously,
AGAINST	Cmon #DrFauci how’s the “curve blunting” going? #coronavirus #COVID19 @CNN - doesn’t look promising given current numbers.
FAVOR	Wearing a mask and social distancing doesn't mean you are "living in fear." It's like wearing a seat belt or using your headlights in the rain, it's for your safety and the safety of others.

AGAINST	WA St’s gov  has issued a mandate that we have to be masked -I wish he added costumes. If I have to see the world walk by me in masks &amp; social distance, I would like the world to walk by me in costume w| their character’s signature walk. I think the world needs that.

FAVOR	It's mind boggling to me the number of people that still aren't wearing masks/wearing masks correctly. Georgia is nowhere close to flattening the curve.

AGAINST	@10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @CMO_England This is idiotic. There are barely any hospital admissions let alone deaths &amp; no scientific evidence to support wearing masks. #PHE death stats were ‘misleading’ so end this madness. Give us back our freedom. #EndLockdown

AGAINST	Any one else notice how the people tut tutting at non mask wearers and pub goers, are the same ones who in ordinary times wouldn't know a good time if it bit them on the bum. You know the sorts, you usually see them sporting high viz vests at the village fete.
AGAINST	@realTomPappert After months of getting groceries at Walmart with no #mask, they told me they are going to start actually enforcing it now. So I finally broke down and ordered a plague doctor costume mask. There's no compliance like malicious compliance.

AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto The Wuhan virus is now weaker than the seasonal flu. There are inexpensive, treatments. A vaccine is only a Big Pharma money maker. Masks are dangerous, they cause health issues. This is America, I don't need or want the Govt to make these decisions for me.

FAVOR	@Mastermind7864 Judge Pirro paid too much money on PLASTIC SURGERY to have her extremely stretched faced hidden behind a mask.  #MasksSaveLives

FAVOR	@kylegriffin1 Neither should we think that #RandPaul knows more about #COVID19 than the experts. But given the choice, I'll bet my life on #DrFauci and the other experts. It's what they do. If you follow Rand Paul's advice instead, good luck, and I'll see you on the other side. #GOP

NONE	@seanmdav Now the dude is a friggin celebrity????  This has gone to his head.  His ego is out of control.  He wants to remain relevant to stay in the limelight.  This is all too obvious.
FAVOR	A corona virus briefing without doctors or scientists is just a stupid rally.
FAVOR	@Allison_Burnett What about the teachers? How long are the teachers going to last in this environment? #resist
FAVOR	@ReallyAmerican1 I work with someone who lives in China, who had assumed that the Chinese news about Americans going to crowded indoor places w/out masks was just "anti-American propaganda," because, she said, "I couldn't believe it! People just aren't that stupid!" @CDC
FAVOR	One day we won't have to distance. One day we won't have to wear masks. One day we won't have to stay home. One day COVID-19 won't be a threat any more. When that day comes... is up to you. #WearAMask #SocialDistance

AGAINST	@SarahTa71922357 @mgalvers @gmpolice Yeah, just open pubs &amp; clubs as it was before.
NONE	I don't think that pooling the COVID testing is a bad thing. Coming from lab sciences and knowing a lot of proposed and currently used assays, this is a wise choice in a pandemic seeing no clear cut end.
NONE	@JerryDunleavy Except for those 6000 people Cuomo killed in nursing homes.
FAVOR	@effiedog Karen should be denied medical care once she contracts #coronavirus   #HealthcareHeroes putting their lives &amp; their families lives on the line &amp; you’re  protesting our #HealthCareWorkers  #SavingLives  Get educated.

AGAINST	@thehill Now talk about how his royal highness, Dr. Fauci, was MASKLESS in the stands at the Nationals game yesterday...sitting shoulder to shoulder with other maskless friends.  You people are pathetic.  #Hypocrites

FAVOR	If you haven’t been wearing a mask in #SanDiego yet, the air from the #Navyfire leaves you no choice now. Quality right now is very mixed. The smell is definitely potent and it can’t be good to take in and mess up the respiratory system now. #StayHome 
AGAINST	#Jesus Didnt Wear a #Mask and he was the son of God. Neither did the Prophet Muhammad or Bhudda.  So neither am I.
NONE	@bennyjohnson @realDonaldTrump @mattgaetz America has a few things to be ashamed about if you have a conscious, empathy, integrity, and a strong sense of responsibility. In order to replace you have to find it. Today, America is unrecognizable.  
AGAINST	@Destiny3650 @DavidakaWyatt Keep this up idiots will be wearing masks forever!
FAVOR	By not quitting and remaining in #Trump's crap Admin, #DrFauci has become irrelevant. Why is he allowing himself and his brilliant career to be ridiculed by Trump on a daily basis?  If he quits, he becomes the unfiltered voice of #Covid19, speaks without fear, and exposes Trump!
NONE	@kp2u @davey1233 @HuwHarries @Jennyashash @ClarkeMicah What a dipshit question! Aren’t the 2 symptomatic people in your ridiculous scenario the irresponsible ones here? Why aren’t THEY self isolating? #idiots #coronahoax #plandemic #ridiculous #sheep #baa

NONE	@LyndaAKApebbles @dougducey @HHSGov No shutdowns. Already a mask mandate in most county and local cities. You need to do as McDucey stated in the press conference - Stay Home, Stay Safe, Watch Netflix...or eat outside if you go dining out.  :joy: #OpenArizona #FakePandemic 
AGAINST	@AP Your lying as usual.  Mask worn at Ford... We have choice in this country.... 
AGAINST	@ErinGoKirk @howardr0613 @AshleyRParker @PhilipRucker @realDonaldTrump Stoopid people. Kids not adults have zero deaths due to covid. The 14 that supposedly died from it (like the adults) had underlying health conditions ALREADY.
NONE	When asked about a possible cure for the #COVIDー19 pandemic, #DrFauci said that antibody testing will be available “very soon”. This leads many Americans to ask how soon is “soon” and when will life begin to resume from where it stopped. #CoronavirusUSA #BeatingCorona #DrFauci
FAVOR	@1TreeSantaCruz @hossehenad @tedcruz @AmericanAir YIKES! @AmericanAir is usually my preference.  Hard N.O. If they don’t enforce their mask wearing policy!

AGAINST	@shell17159039 @JustMe123____ @josekayemba @brianstelter Fact is Fauci has conflicts of interest with #BigPharma Go read what he wrote in the NE journal of medicine back in March or the CDCs 5 planning scenarios from April. Much different tune then what Fauci says on TV.
AGAINST	Number 1 complaint from people prior to #COVID19 #Coronavirus in #MentalHealth was access to care yet now that MOST mental health agencies are closed &amp; only doing teletherapy GOOD LUCK GETTING HELP!
NONE	Dr. Fauci needs to legalize marijuana as an alternative cure for covid19 survivors asap which means legalize in all 50 states or its

AGAINST	We The People have heard and seen enough of his flip-flop flapping lips and we're tired of it. He wants to hold NY as the model of handling the virus well, even though 32k people have died...
AGAINST	@ksdknews Oh they’re going back to school! My kids are not capable of homeschooling for more than a few weeks as their grades were LOWER than normal. All this talk about teachers “risking their lives” is absurd...
AGAINST	@RealBasedMAGA do you really believe "brown dog" is an oncologist ?  thats a typical agitator account.    anyway, please make sure the governor of Texas gets your message about the phony covid test results. this is going on everywhere. they have to keep the hoax going.

AGAINST	#DrFauci is severely compromised. His inability to contain this epidemic is due to his investments in bio labs that produce vaccines! #COVID19 #@realDonaldTrump #MAGA2020

NONE	How do you sleep at night @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WhiteHouse with so many of our citizens sick and drying? Your line in the sand is a mask? Your line in the sand is a mask!!!! Pathetic! #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
AGAINST	@realDonaldTrump Take them down.  Big pharma and their paid representatives are killing Americans by the thousands every year.  Your buddy Fauci was against the cure for Covid from the beginning and now tens of thousands of dead Americans are on his hands.  They put profit over health.
NONE	“The virus doesn’t read talking points,” @DrTomFrieden said. “The #virus doesn’t watch news shows. The virus just waits for us to make mistakes. And when we make mistakes, as TX, FL, SC, &amp; AZ did, the virus wins. When we ignore science, the virus wins.” #COVID19

NONE	@HighlanderMSP @brawday @Feroxbill1 It seems that some people can't think beyond themselves and their needs. They will also be the people who complain if there is another lockdown, effectively caused by their lack of compliance.
