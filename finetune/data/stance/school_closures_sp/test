So its not only about cost bare by schools. Its about their teachers' 100% dedication. So i think the comparison is not correct.
FAVOR	Kayleigh McEnany said "the science shouldn't stand in the way" of schools opening.  During a pandemic the only thing we should listen to is SCIENCE! My children are not political pawns #NotMyChildren
FAVOR	Y’all can go ahead and open the schools. My kid will just stay home. :middle_finger_medium-light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	You must close the schools for a period of time corona virus infected many people, do it now u don’t want to be like Italy
FAVOR	A parent asked reason 4 stopping online lrng. I explained to him the entire situation &amp; he said,' What about parents who r willing 2 pay fees? And why shouldn't we? The situation is not created by schools, it's affecting entire wrld, then why do u hv 2 suffer?'
FAVOR	Online teaching is also a service and teachers need to be paid. Schools need to survive.
NONE	While we teach our children to accommodate to the new normal, do you seriously foresee it as a society without schools! Is that what you want us to teach them?  That’s what “No Fees” directive indicate
NONE	Every time you point a finger on others —there are three remaining fingers pointing right back at you.” @narendramodi @DrRPNishank @rashtrapatibhvn Reform the government schools where there is a need, don't put your energy in regulating private schools.
FAVOR	How much do you think a jury would award a family in punitive damages from a school district for the #Covid19 death of a teacher, student, cafeteria worker that was forced to go to school because Trump is a fucking idiot?
FAVOR	We have to wait for somebody to actually get the coronavirus in our school for us to close? Shouldn't we be closing the schools to prevent the spread of this?are schools that desperate for money to the point that they will wait for somebody to get infected?
NONE	@ElectQuinn @marcorubio You won’t be wearing those because our nurses and doctors need them. A cloth mask won’t kill you and it’s the nice thing to do. I think your religion says it’s Christ like. #WearADamnMask #WearAMask #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpFailedAmerica
FAVOR	We recognize that schooling is important, but kids lives matter more. It's about time schools close. South African children matter!  #Ramaphosa #cyrilramaphosa #AngieMotshega
AGAINST	I doubt Coronavirus will think oh no schools are closed today, how about I come back tomorrow :woozy_face:
FAVOR	@donwinslow @Fythia Trump wants schools open so he can say things are opening up. Trump thinks that opening schools and opening the economy will help his re-election bid. Trump does not think about the children at all.

NONE	Any parent who puts a mask over their child's face is guilty of child abuse.   #ChildAbuse

NONE	@SenJohnKennedy I plan to attend your Covid-19 funeral.
FAVOR	@DarrenSproat @PremierScottMoe In 5 weeks, the Premier plans to move kids to the front lines, unprepared.
AGAINST	If @GavinNewsom closes down schools today, the @DNC can NEVER again claim to be the "party of science."
FAVOR	Reopening schools is the height of insanity.
FAVOR	@RepLeeZeldin No testing plan = No school.
FAVOR	Teachers should use their current collective leverage. They can clearly argue our economy largely depends on them. There is no reason trump and his ilk would be so determined to force schools open while #COVID19 is raging if this wasn't true. #COVID19
AGAINST	@ChuckCallesto Start protesting parents and everyone who wants the Economy to be stable.  The pandemic is not as bad as initially thought.  Every child should be allowed to go to school as normal.  Face masks also make zero sense.  99.95 chance of survival and rising!
NONE	@KirinDave @brianreagan7 @TrumpWarRoom @CBSNews Did you miss the stories just yesterday of 33 Florida labs caught exaggerating positive Chinese coronavirus results by a factor of ten. How many other labs across the country are doing the same.
FAVOR	@donwinslow I’m a special education teacher and I will probably have to go into school each day, but I will not send in my twin 15 year old daughters. My 78 year old mother lives with us so I will quarantine myself in my room when I get home each day.
NONE	@donwinslow This is nothing but the truth. Did Twitter censure the bounty Hoax tweet Trump put out, no they didn’t &amp; that tweet is a total lie. NATO and allies were briefed along with Trump himself. So no, @TwitterSupport, this video speaks the truth &amp; nothing is embellished.
AGAINST	The children have and are still  undergoing such a big change. The only constant is     their home, parents, teachers &amp; schools. With Schools stopping can you imagine the turmoil all of them will undergo. Just think, think and think
FAVOR	@apiper13 @nowthisnews Schools aren't ready.I know when my children get sick i always quarantined them in rooms.Yet I still get it We knw It goes thru the household maybe kids are more ASymptomatic for now until it mutates again &amp; Give it to Others, Teachers,Staff it'll spreads over &amp; over.
FAVOR	Stop calling them heroes and get them the help they need. American teachers shouldn't have to die. #TeacherSafetyIsEssential
AGAINST	I hope all of those who are so keen to have the schools stay closed are also ok with the staff not having jobs...adios teacher aides , bus drivers etc.
FAVOR	Trump is NOT an educator and he's NOT a doctor why would anyone listen to Trump over our educators who have been in the classroom?? We know the nature of students and we know students Will Not social distance or keep their mask on.... They're Children
FAVOR	Children can't maintain social distancing!
FAVOR	@thekenshain @TheJLV Part 2 of 2. At the end of the day, schools with sealed windows, and interior classrooms will have #Coronavirus buildup that will increase #COVID19 viral load! These building shouldn't be used. Children and teachers are not going to be victims of "risk mitigation"
FAVOR	@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Then why are schools being forced to open if he is so caring?
AGAINST	Please reopen the schools
FAVOR	There isn’t a child on this planet who would social distance and wear a mask for SIX hours a day, 5 days a week.
NONE	GOG: Courage would be to openly announce the clear motive “Shut Private Schools”,  why underneath pseudo directive Of “No Fees”? No fees means No schools right?
NONE	T-97 @___AmanYadav  Why do private schools go to the High Court to seek justice? We don't want to spend the Court's precious time as you are our people representatives. Listen to our voice. We want to trust you. We want you to think holistically &amp; teacher in mind.
AGAINST	@AnnaForFlorida My son's school has guidelines in place.  These guidelines and steps are very thought out...all looks good to me.  He is going back to school when it opens next month.
AGAINST	@GovMurphy Your lock downs are all about politics.  We all sacrificed to flatten the curve.  Open up NJ now.  If masks work or being 6 feet apart works then NJ can open schools - right.  Or here is another thought.
NONE	Schools and teachers overnight transformed themselves. It was schools and teachers who engaged children and lifted their spirits by involving them in meaningful activities.
FAVOR	#PostponeJEE_NEETinCovid We Wont give exams until our parliament is closed and until there is no vaccine. As WHO says covid has become airborne and can travel upto 15 feet, so socil distancing will be a joke at the examination centres.teenagers are at higher risk

FAVOR	Close schools , put teachers on unpaid leave and let them apply for TERS like private school teachers
FAVOR	Please tell the government to shut down schools and pay teachers without bringing up the child support grant as if it's not important yona. I don't understand why people always attack people who earn grant, it's for kids, they are innocent they need it.

FAVOR	@ChrisMurphyCT @ChrisMurphyCT Can you please hammer this point home with @GovNedLamont ? We can't reopen schools like this.
FAVOR	Social distancing is just a beautiful theory, learners when you turn your back they don’t practice it nor wear masks. Even teaching is not conducive, how do you avoid touching learners scripts?. Even marking class tests?
NONE	@AlexBerenson Every doctor I’ve seen- derm, ortho, dentist- has pulled their mask down when entering the room and talked to me face to face #Ohio
AGAINST	Open #texas #Schools is a must for our kids!!
NONE	In these difficult times government can not ignore the sufferings of Private schools. We the teachers have not received our salary from past 3 months and may be for next few months too. Please do something to keep School and it's staff alive.
AGAINST	Parents who do not want to send their children to school, should be free to do so, with whatever consequences (repeat the grade?). But leave the rest alone and let the children learn. #SchoolReopening
NONE	We live in a democracy then why has the government taken its decision only after hearing a handful of people?  It is the government's responsibility to be fair &amp; hear from every stakeholder - be it parents, teachers, schools, children.
FAVOR	@itsJeffTiedrich The kind of president that wants schools to reopen during a raging killer pandemic.
FAVOR	so are public schools going to wait until students start getting infected with corona virus to close them or...? :face_with_rolling_eyes: #CUNY
FAVOR	Fredrick Ingram, president of Florida's largest teachers' union has accused DeSantis, tЯump of "playing politics with children's lives" as they continue to push for schools to reopen even as new coronavirus cases are on the rise in Florida and across the country.
FAVOR	@marcorubio There is no absolute here.  Kids need schooling which is education, not "need to go back to school" which is a place.  The cost of life outweighs the cost of being at a place every time. Stop word-smithing your way around an issue that could kill thousands.  
NONE	#de Blasio reaffirmed Thursday New York City's plan is to have as many students in person in #school as possible when classes are scheduled to resume on #September 10  #NYC

NONE	We actually have to Stan the University of Liverpool. Glad I put them as my firm #coronavirus
AGAINST	Why should schools stay closed? None of these kids are social distancing or wearing mask there all on beaches, lake's and hanging out in parking lots in crowd's. They all believe this virus is only older people so let them go to school
FAVOR	@librarianjennie I’d feel better if we could get covid tests, close ALL the schools in my area and close the restaurants. I don’t see that happening here:weary: #marin #coronacalifornia #coronavirus
FAVOR	Say a student contract Covid19, will the entire school shut down and quarantine for 14 days? Will teachers have to notify their children's school because their children are students in a different district. Will their child school have to close? This will be a mess.
FAVOR	and all you had to do to make parents feel safer and trust what you're doing is set up a free satellite 5G network, give every student a desktop and VR (for recess in the public school version of Xbox live), create a classroom environment with computer programs
NONE	Why only private teachers are always targets by the people who are not sending their children to a good school and always opposing the functions of good schools. Government teachers are receiving their full salary in account in every month with doing nothing.
AGAINST	How can a ban work for all schools without having consulted or included all schools of Gujarat in the decision making process? Don't ruin the entire private education system! #SaveOurSchools #RightToLearn @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp
FAVOR	Alyssa_Milano: Trump has cancelled the RNC Convention in Jacksonville, FL due to concerns about #covid19.   But he wants us to send our children to school.
NONE	The very same leaners are going around the streets and our communities without Masks. I just came back from the shop's and no-one is wearing a mask in my community. Government must just make the  unemployed youth  ambassadors for Covid-19.
AGAINST	Society is bound to fall If Schools fall.
FAVOR	So private schools are taking decisions to close. Not public schools? Viruses don’t discriminate. Viruses don’t care about your bank balance. Viruses don’t care if you went to Hillsong conference, or the football or to school. #COVID2019 #COVID19Aus #coronavirus
NONE	Politicians and bureaucrats who keep calling private schools for admissions and do what not to get a seat should be reminded that your kids don’t go to Govt schools but come to us for quality education. Don’t kill the goose which lays golden eggs for you all.
FAVOR	@City_Press Government is fighting with their employers by gambling with our kids lives!! #ChildrensLivesMatter #saveourchildren

FAVOR	Parents have the power, by simply pulling all your kids out of school, all schools will shut down!
NONE	If we gonna shut down schools we mustn’t do it cause of #COVID19 we must do it cause the school system doesn’t work,niggers been going to school and niggers are still broke and stupid :joy:

FAVOR	@JustinAHorwitz @ReallyAmerican1 Science should not stand in the way of opening our schools. But I guarantee you, this virus will shut them down permanently.
NONE	@kaitlancollins .@PressSec yesterday ...  “The President has said unmistakably that he wants schools to open ... and when he says ‘open’ he means open and full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school. The science should not stand in the way of this.”
FAVOR	@redfreedom2020 @donwinslow Taught 30 years. I can tell you that schools are a Petri dish for germs. Kids don’t follow/understand hygiene standards like adults do, and they constantly touch one another. Normally our bodies fight it off. Not with Covid.
NONE	Finally something good from the coronavirus:
FAVOR	@GovSisolak Close these schools
FAVOR	Hit like if you want schools to shutdown.
FAVOR	@BorisJohnson Can you please explain to the nation what plans you have put in place to open up the schools in September!! Seemingly you (like trump) don't have a plan Get your act together else the schools will be empty Spend the money on school safety! :rage:
NONE	Thanks Facebook for allowing groups to spread anti-science and anti-vax information on their platform. Bottom line is that vaccines work. Don't like your kids vaccinations it? That's your right but don't expect others to make exceptions for your selfishness.

FAVOR	Today our school released their “return to learn” plan. The plan is fine, however recent FB postings of school sanctioned activities with no masks &amp; no social distancing makes me pause. I will make whatever sacrifices are necessary for my children to learn from home
NONE	Should teachers get paid when schools shut down?
FAVOR	@MegaRacismHater @AdamSchefter Good. The whole league should do the same ... keep the schools closed too!
FAVOR	@TessEractica @NotSteveOkay @VABVOX @KoriWasinger @ABC I saw that. This is yet another reason why we can't open schools. These anti-mask folks ruin gains made, even work in schools and have kids. No way would I want my kid sitting next to some whacked out anti-mask kid or get an anti-mask teacher.
FAVOR	I live in King County, two towns from the epicenter of COVID-19  Schools are open but 1/2 full  At elem schools, kids sneeze, spit when talking, eat from a salad bar &amp; might be carriers w few symptoms  CLOSE, subsidize needed school lunches &amp; send teachers home
FAVOR	Now stop calling them schools, colleges, universities because they are test centers now. You have to teach at home &amp; schools just to rate excellent, good, poor. Honestly, I am speaking after experience of children education. Therefore, make everything online.
NONE	@JayeetaBasu7 @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj Yes indeed and this will only be possible if capable parents pay the dues on time and be helpful in this direction. They should be allowed to pay and Schools should be allowed to Collect Fees.
NONE	@realjuliasong But did you touch your face?!  #coronavirus #COVID19
NONE	Wonder how much #pfizer stock #Fauci owns? Ever wonder why he keeps the fear level high? Look into his background and vaccines. It all starts to make sense. #FireFauciNow
AGAINST	the fact that my district isn’t closing the schools because no student has the corona virus (that we know of) when the hospitals are saying that there WILL be an outbreak is ridiculous.
FAVOR	@ParTroyHills @TroyHillsSchool if u have an employee who has come in contact with coronavirus why would u let students come in contact w/them or anything they touch &amp; risk spreading it #coronavirus #bettersafethansorry
NONE	The Federal Government has on Monday, 13th July, 2020, released guildlines and requirements for the reopening of schools at all levels though no date of resumption is yet to be announced.  The big question is can students cope?  #CNUI #COVID19
NONE	Save schools, Save the future... #SaveOurSchools
NONE	To prevent #Economiccollapse  &amp; #economiccrisis during #CoronavirusPandemic govt should get banks to help businesses by postponing EMI’s and giving a discount in the interest charged. This small step would go a long way #COVID #coronavirusinindia #Coronavid19
FAVOR	My high school child will not go back to school on August 18th, with the rise in #COVID__19 cases. I worry for her teachers, classmates, and people that they may bring covid home today. @GavinNewsom is failing to lead and protect schools.
FAVOR	@JustinBrannan @agounardes @Sen_Gounardes  I'm concerned about the coronavirus and CUNYs lack of disinfecting strategies. They aren't cleaning. CUNY is overcrowded and we're all commuter schools, we can't avoid mass transit. They won't listen to us. #CUNY
FAVOR	Right to  quality education is a fundamental right and schools are doing it to the best online
NONE	imagine...@BetsyDeVosED and @realDonaldTrump trying to threaten public schools...by cutting their funding... lol what a NEW and spooky threat
FAVOR	@MSNBC All countries in the western world opening schools but let's see..we don't follow the science to open schools but we followed science to shut down..oh ok now that makes sense.
FAVOR	Any education lawyers out there?   If a teacher or a child dies of #COVID19 CAUGHT AT SCHOOL can the government be sued, given every other damn country has cancelled schools?  Surely there’s a duty of care there?
AGAINST	The reason Parliament is closed and schools are open is because this Covid-19 virus kills old people than young people,so I don't get the logic behind the argument that kids must stay at home cause Parliament is closed,kids must go to school.
FAVOR	2) We as Sadtu want schools to close because of the Standard Operating Procedures are not being implemented consistently across provinces. Schools are operating on autopilot and acting outside the SOP. We won't even get to social inequalities
FAVOR	@DrZweliMkhize Don’t teachers and learners fall under your banner of “all South Africans”? How do we force children to social distance when you can’t even make adults Social distance??  #TeachersLivesMatter #StudentLivesMatter
AGAINST	They didn't close the schools when the Swine Flu was going around, so they shouldn't close the schools for Coronavirus! If I didn't get time off school because some people had a cough, then neither should they!
FAVOR	@eugenegu And he wants to force schools to reopen.
FAVOR	Knowing what I know from working on the COVID-19 response, I would not send my children to school (if I had any) in the situation Trump is demanding under our current pandemic situation.
NONE	@GalaJenish @anubha1812 @nidhiindiatv Sorry but schools are usually not profit mongering. Parents who fight education spending but are ready to spend on holiday travel should introspect on what is important.
NONE	I received a call yesterday from Batho Pele Vastfontein Christian School. In my son's class they have a case and now he is in 14 days quarantine.
AGAINST	Stopping the work is the simplest thing can be done but skill lies in running the institutions in such situations. Hats off to schools but Govt wants something else !! @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj

FAVOR	@drdavidsamadi @Acosta There's a vas deferens between Urology and Infectious Disease specialities. The science is clear that it's not safe to reopen schools. This is genocide and YOU should be ashamed for promoting the WH talking points and not facts.
FAVOR	@W7VOA @GOPconvention You do realize adults work at schools, so chances are my colleagues, their family, my family and myself have a high risk in contracting the virus and possibly dying.
FAVOR	@RepRalphNorman @grahamblog @SenatorTimScott  @scsenategop #coronavirus #southcarolina Close the schools!
AGAINST	And there hours of operation are Mon thru Fri 7 am to 6pm...so why are schools shut down again?
AGAINST	Teachers help parents manage the learning needs of kids. It’s unfair to stop schools! Let parents lean on their child’s school to help the child. Why deny that? @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj  #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	@AlexBerenson Teachers unions suck! Open up the schools!  They were open months ago in Europe, China and everywhere else in the world. Kids don’t spread the virus per the European study.  And mask don’t work (even the fraud Fauci said in March)
NONE	@MmusiMaimane if you want something to be done in this country... Get the taxis behind you.
FAVOR	My daughter is a SLP working in public schools. I do not want her to be exposed to COVID everyday and risk our lives for an agenda from the trump regime.
FAVOR	@BarackObama  (HELP!) If the #coronavirus can pass person to person during a 20 min. car ride (to a hospital). How many kids could pick up the virus in a 7 hr. school day? (10-20?) How many kids &amp; staff would become sick in a week?(200-500?) #COVID19
FAVOR	@TrumpWarRoom @weijia Not the science is in the way to reopen: the virus is! Very little evidence &amp; data because kids are not tested that much! They get infected or are asymptomatic carriers. In EU: small groups, alternated classes, masks &amp; washing hands, not before September 1.
NONE	We are more than happy to showcase all the hard work being put in by the schools, teachers, and the management. Work with us to come up with a solution that works for everyone!
FAVOR	@GOP We are fine with opening schools with a PLAN, mandatory masks, contact tracing, onsite testing with same day results, required social distancing. PPE for teachers, staff, janitors, etc. It requires MONEY and the do-nothing GOP will provide none of that.
FAVOR	This is tiring, those parents who says kids are safe at schools should just bring them once, and hope their funeral covers and policies are up to date...mine will be at home!!!
FAVOR	Maybe the govt wants to force kids back to school because they saw kids at home for half a semester learning a non-white-washed-history-curriculum starting to question EVERYTHING and thought.... ah fuck, we gotta get this shit back on track. 
NONE	Today 10th March 2020 in Greece all schools closed for 14 days.  Today in Italy 168 humans died due to #Coronavirus #Covid19 .
FAVOR	People are saying that kids won’t Have a safe place to go to if the schools are closed. Large gatherings are not safe with coronavirus. The coronavirus is not safe.
FAVOR	If u ain’t sick we all finna have a ton of time to stay home and workout because of quarantine. Become a skinny legend :clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone: #coronapocolypse #COVID2019 #coronavirus

FAVOR	Closing schools isn't a bad idea considering that majority of rush hour comes from students commuting to class. And the TTC is so congested because of Uoft, Ryerson, and York students. It's dumb tol wait until #COVID19 infects a student before taking action #UofT
FAVOR	All these parents claiming their kids won’t wear masks if schools open...Okay, then kids can bring peanut butter to school again because all death options matter. Schools should not open!  #COVID19 #coronavirus #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	Schools in Eldoradopark and Edenpark are closed as principals agreed with the parents that although school time is lost it's better for kids to repeat a grade instead of burying children #SchoolMustClose
NONE	So just got a survey call about opening schools in Idaho.  Some interesting questions to say the least.
FAVOR	it doesn’t make sense to wait for someone to catch COVID-19 in order for schools to be shut down. if your school doesn’t care about your health and safety, sign a petition, call and email them, or just don’t show up to class. YOU come first.
AGAINST	It’s been four months, my kids have played with their neighborhood friends almost every day- none of us have COVID. Tell me why we can’t open up schools WITHOUT masks and social distancing?
AGAINST	Why are counties/states putting children last? They need to go back to school or the socioeconomical divide will widen. #OpenAmerica
FAVOR	@GavinNewsom you need to close all schools by next Tuesday (3/17). The children don’t show symptoms as easily.  They are killing their grandparents and teachers! #COVID19
NONE	If you don’t see martial law coming &amp; canceling our election, you must look ahead.We cannot exercise our 1st Amendment Rights to protest police brutality with this maniac in a red tie in office. Every other country can; even Russia! #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
NONE	@donwinslow DeVos and trump can speak of reopening schools all they want.

FAVOR	Trying to figure out how a govenor “can’t” mandate masks, but is saying schools MUST open in person @henrymcmaster #Hypocrite #sceducation @SCforEd #teacher
FAVOR	@donwinslow Trump is like the mayor of Amity Island in the movie Jaws. Demanding schools open is like demanding the beaches open
FAVOR	So, Republicans want to move their stupid convention outdoors, but kids should go sit in schools?
FAVOR	@RepDanCrenshaw The countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. The US has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.
FAVOR	So let me get this straight, 6 new COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the city of San Diego and kids in the @SDUSD still have to go to school while many other institutions are going into online teaching?
NONE	@Tges_Official Parents should have a right to choose the format of their children's education, especially in such uncertain times. We don't know when #schools will open, so there have to exist various avenues for children to continue their #education

NONE	Is Angie still testing waters ??? It will end in tears :sob:
FAVOR	Oh, it’s going to be “a safe reopening of the schools.”   We can all stop worrying. Donald Trump says it will be safe, so it will be safe because he says so. When has he ever been wrong before?  What is his strategy? That it will be safe. Simple.    #TrumpsAmerica
AGAINST	Guess who's going to be hurt the most by keeping schools closed? Ding... ding... ding.... all they want to do is keep the divide and keep the classes separated.
NONE	@CDCDirector , so you caved. Got it...#CDCTrumpVirus #TrumpVirus

AGAINST	If daycares and preschools are open and thriving, WHY can’t K-12 schools fully open?
NONE	OCPS is going to conduct yet ANOTHER survey about reopening schools. The language of the new survey is going to *encourage LaunchEd. @GovRonDeSantis
NONE	Even religious institutions and hospitals don't work for free... How can you expect from schools then???? Don't teachers have their families and expenses just like you have???
AGAINST	@Leafsbh @DrTomFrieden People die.  We cannot allow our Republic to die.  Open the schools!  Allow businesses to open if they choose. Allow people to choose to go out or not.  No more fear mongering and government control!
FAVOR	Tell me why the GOP convention in Florida can be cancelled due to Covid but schools are ok to open??? :thinking_face:#COVID #mondaythoughts #teacher
FAVOR	Remember when people said, "Imagine if Covid-19 killed children instead of the elderly...how would we react then?"  Do we want to find out?
FAVOR	I never thought id see the day where #Conservatives and #Libertarians are wanting #PUBLICSCHOOLS to open. FUCK public schools! #COVID__19 #SaveTheChildren
FAVOR	@kurteichenwald Do not take the excuse that it's the school's decision and it's a private school. Believe that 45 should be putting pressure on his son's school to open just like he's putting pressure on public schools.  I don't care what schools open. Mine is going virtually.
FAVOR	@DWUhlfelderLaw No every elected official who supports opening the schools should be forced to send their kids and grandchildren.
FAVOR	@AliNouriPhD @UROCKlive1 When I read this I can’t help but conclude that opening schools is the worst possible thing we could do.
AGAINST	@ru_awake_yet Wow let's see if our illustrious Governor @GavinNewsom @ksbw @bayareamoms #Santaclaracountyschooldistrict     #GavinNewsom gets the memo and opens up Bay area schools etc #openCAschools
NONE	#HerdImmunity is the only way. #NoMasks
FAVOR	Thanks Bill, you like to keep our school open, during this fucking catastrophe of the #coronavirus.  #CLOSENYCPUBLICSCHOOLS
FAVOR	OMG! I heard that only FOUR schools closed in my state because of coronavirus! :O  I hope it's not gonna spread.... I'm so terrified, and also tomorrow I have college &gt;~&lt;
FAVOR	We don’t want free stuff! We  appreciate the best efforts put in by our schools. Our school deserves to take fees  for adapting to the new ways of teaching!
FAVOR	@KateBrownForOR Yes! This should include educators being asked to return to the classroom in the middle of a pandemic that is not under control. Schools must be online only until we have testing and tracing fully in place. #teachersareessential #WeStandTogether4SafeSchools #NotMyKid
FAVOR	@donwinslow I’ll home school if our schools reopen.
NONE	@JustMEtillDeath @Francis_Joseph Perhaps you need to acquaint yourself with the yardstick for measuring the cost of 'quality' education (provided by pvt schools that cater to 50% of the Indian school kids, and by the way to which most of the govt officers children go!). Just a thought
FAVOR	So. What are we MISSING while Donald &amp; betsy promote reopening schools?  Tax returns? Rigged 2016? Rigged 2020? The siphoning off of USA $$$ to Russia &amp; China?   MARY TRUMPS BOOK?   Donalds escape hatch getting readied?
NONE	Public schools are communist indoctrination camps.  Get your kids out if you can.
FAVOR	Reopening schools this fall as if everything is normal is stupid.  Students, teachers and staff are worth protecting.  Im not willing to send my kids into harms way for trumps ego.
FAVOR	“A major teachers union in Los Angeles says the district can’t re-open schools until there is a ‘moratorium’ on charter schools."   With good reason. Charter schools do not protect teachers, refuse troubled students, drain money and talent from our school system.
NONE	@bethanyshondark Bethany, you do know between 50,00 and 100,000 people die in the US from the flu every year WITH VACCINES, right? #OpenAmericaNow
FAVOR	How about instead of endangering children, you give some money to education and fix our schools' horrible technology infrastructure so they can do the same things from home.
FAVOR	My first online class was over Skype and the first 30mins was watching a classmate document himself cooking eggs. All in all a 10/10 experience #coronavirus #StayAtHome
FAVOR	In my opinion, we should have home school or distance schooling for our children. It’s not just the Corona Virus we need to worry about, but violence. Our kid’s will be picked on or beaten on just because of skin color! Bullying will increase.
AGAINST	So if tonight's family meeting, says "School are closed".  What happens to those who paid yearly school fees?  I am no longer homeschooling, my kids will repeat next year. I don't have energy to teach this second term. #coronavirusInSA
FAVOR	coronavirus would spread quickly around my small college and i know some people who are way to dramatic and i don’t want to deal with them being infected
AGAINST	@Real_Eudaimonia Nice. For your sake, I hope the 4 deeply conservatives see through the covid BS and open schools on time, and with none of the unnecessary social distancing precautions.
FAVOR	Just close the schools and promote each and every learner i mean this education system is all about producing factory faults.
AGAINST	@GTnate56 Good question.  Perhaps schools will open soon. We must make our voices heard.  It is not the time to be quiet.
FAVOR	Lockdown mai we are missing friends,teachers,and our class study but have to follow rules for saving ourself from covid-19 that's why we should focus on online study:innocent:
AGAINST	@Variety I guess teachers aren’t essential workers after all.  We managed to keep grocery clerks working. It isn’t hard to protect teachers. We’re the only country in the world not opening schools. @TheDemocrats want to keep people stupid &amp;compliant.  This madness has to end
FAVOR	@donwinslow There is no plan no federal government preparations to safely open schools “let’s not let science get in the way” :flushed:
NONE	.@DallasISDMedia NO IN PERSON SCHOOL @ least through Labor Day. New info tomorrow. #COVID19
FAVOR	Like what are we going to do if we get it, is there a cure for coronavirus? no. cancel school. We don’t want more children getting sick. @ScottMorrisonMP #Coronavid19 #coronavirus #coronavirusaustralia #Covid_19australia
FAVOR	@PamKeithFL @ACLU Florida does NOT meet re-open criteria.  Schools do NOT pass the 3 C's  Closed Spaces, Close Contact, Crowded Areas.   Since Florida Fails the CDC guidelines it is my duty as a Parent to say MY CHILD will not be in a "brick and mortar" school.  #FloridaCovidEpicenter
FAVOR	This is why so many parents are against this blanket decision by  @CMOGuj . Children want their schools - online for now till they can run into them again. They miss their teachers and imagine what you will do to them when they will not have schools to return to?
FAVOR	The parliament remains closed but kids are sent to schools. What exactly is our government thinking?
NONE	y’all do realise there’s no point washing your hands if u don’t wash ur face, u touch your face so many times a day. i also wipe down my phone everyday to prevent germs on it bc i ain’t taking no chances #coronavirus #covid19UK #CoronaOutbreak
AGAINST	@VivDaRocha @teachcardona @EducateCT @GovNedLamont Apparently you are the one who doesn’t care, perfectly ok with a large percentage of children getting no education if schools don’t open, can you say privilege?
AGAINST	The policymakers need to consider the fact that schools can't run without fees and teachers can't survive without salary.
FAVOR	@TeaPainUSA I think the kids who get COVID-19 at school should go to @GovParsonMO's home until they get over it.   #COVIDIOTS  #ProtectOurKids
NONE	So grateful to be entering my 13th year of homeschooling.
FAVOR	Unless the so called madam minister Angie gets infected by the virus that the only way she'll finally gain her conscious and decides to close schools if not then she'll want to sacrifice our children for their own amusement we should protest if we have too!!!
NONE	If schools shouldn't charge fees ,then no tax ,no electricity bills for all, no food bills, no grocery bills, let the whole capital society disintegrate
NONE	@CMOGuj, seek help from well established schools and educators. Let's support each other. Don't abandon or schools and teachers. Happy to help. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @HRDMinistry @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh
FAVOR	@dougducey It is unsafe to open schools in 4 weeks.   We can almost guarantee you will not follow the science but follow Trump down the rabbit hole again.  This time you can take that trip alone.
FAVOR	@MaryRedden1 Even some of the suburban schools have issues with cleaning supplies and ask parents to provide them at the beginning of the year. With most people unemployed this is untenable.  #keepsafe  #schools
NONE	@adarsh_lohd @minalgur @Francis_Joseph @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp All the more reason to keep supporting each other &amp; raising our voices against everything tht is going wrong in education system of India. Unfair decisions &amp; outcomes cannot be tolerated. Parents, teachers, schools have to stand together for #RighttoLearn &amp; to
FAVOR	@meralee727 Please, parents, speak up- call your board of education, your superintendent. YOUR voices are the only voices that matter to the decision makers. “Recommended distancing when possible” is NOT an answer to how schools will keep everyone safe. #NotMyKid
FAVOR	@NorahODonnell @CDCgov @BojorquezCBS This is extremely Frightening news especially with a high number of schools mandating “in-person” school AND the government basically discrediting CDC!!! :flushed: Not to mention all of the current civil unrest!!! :flushed::flushed: #PublicHlthDisaster
FAVOR	@Youtube01829362 @_Azriell_ @CharlesMunn1 @MadDemSocialist @LevonSiler Are you a teacher? You think that will happen? It will not. Children tend to not listen in school from my Teaching pre-3rd then older 7th. I can't get behind your logic at all. Teacher will spend the day Keep your masks on wash your hands..not so close..unbelievable.
NONE	There are way more people with coronavirus than we know about. We should be cautious, but it is already in the community.  We need to mitigate and so some serious social distancing starting yesterday. Because...hello #italy
NONE	It’s not the schools that are scamming, it’s the entire education board or it’s executives on a larger perspective.
FAVOR	@cnn question is @realDonaldTrump son Barron going to school or does he have a tutor - would be interesting to know what he is doing as he pushes for schools to be open #covid19
FAVOR	@ossoff Well, the reopening of schools should go smoothly. I was told that anyone with a fever can return to school 24 hours after it breaks. There’s no testing, not even a doctor’s note required for staff and students to return.   #NotMyKid
NONE	@SheriAWilkinson TIE DeSantis (R-FL) @GovRonDeSantis  Kemp  (R-GA) @GovKemp Abbott (R-TX) @GovAbbott  Reeves (R-MS) @tatereeves  Ivey (R-AL) @GovernorKayIvey  Ducey (R-AZ) @dougducey  All Trump Ducklings! Endangering American Lives! #Resistance #TheResistance #Resist
FAVOR	@CDCgov We should all be terrified that @realDonaldTrump is blocking @CDCgov from testifying on reopening schools. He’s sacrificing the lives of kids, teachers &amp; school staff &amp; he doesn’t want us to know. This. Is. Happening.
FAVOR	tRUmpublicans think it's OK to rape, cage, starve, gun-down or expose our children to a deadly pandemic but lose their shit about abortion.  
FAVOR	as someone who is autoimmune, i do NOT want to be catching coronavirus... but of course the schools don't care about it :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes:
NONE	School is a community where we enlighten innocent minds &amp; prepare them for the future challenges. But Present Policies &amp;  Political involvement has completely ruined the educational structure of our schools,colleges &amp; private institutions.
FAVOR	Theoretically, you could be walking around with coronavirus for 2 weeks without knowing   And I go to an American school, also known as a PIGSTY  So before all 135,000 students get the coronavirus  Why don’t we just
FAVOR	Schools have taken a lot of effort in setting up the online classes. It's a new era of the digital world and we need to support it and not spoil it.
FAVOR	@SatterleyAndrew @GOP @realDonaldTrump The plan is .... that having no guidance, leaving it up to schools to figure it out, gives them the guilt free feelz. Just like in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arizona.....  no worries. #COVIDIOTS
NONE	I was thinking schools and teachers will be rewarded for their tremendous efforts after coming out from  Covid 19 problem but the advisors of Govt think differently. @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj
FAVOR	But if schools close who is gonna occupy those graves? Cause politicians(protected) smokers (protected) drunkards(protected) school kids &amp; teachers VERY EXPOSED.
FAVOR	Recall: Indians(Native Americans now) were forced to send their kids to schools on othe side of the State (SD) where diseases spread through the schools.Parents didn't know if they were going to get their kids back.Some called it genocide. My aunt was a teacher there.
FAVOR	Donald Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and kill a million schoolchildren via #COVID19 and not lose any #MAGA voters..
FAVOR	@mitch61nm @yeahunoeme So...Religious and private schools can do anything they want.  PUBLIC schools must fully open, on campus and no PPE restrictions.   What a vile evil man he is. Genocide against the non elite. With our children as the catalyst.
FAVOR	Republicans: "All lives matter!"  *is asked to wear a mask for the sake of others*  Republicans: "No, not like that!"  #notmykid
FAVOR	Spare tie? Never heard of her, I've dedicated this whole week to refreshing the news page waiting for the schools to close down or for Boris Johnson to get the Corona Virus
FAVOR	Parents that want the schools to reopen no matter what are monsters that don’t give a flying fuck about their kids’ well-being, sacrificing their own litter only to make a moronical political statement. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	Coronavirus has shut down all private universities across NYC, but all CUNY schools are still open. This is wildly irresponsible considering CUNY students are lower income, &amp; more likely to not have insurance. This is what a war on the poor looks like.
NONE	@JeffreyGuterman Go home and spread it to their parents, siblings, grandparents, neighbors, friends...  That’s obviously ok with this #COVIDIOTS #WearADamnMask
AGAINST	Why is opening schools a political issue now? Families of kids with special needs are really struggling without school or in person services. Zoom makes my son’s sensory issues worse. Do ye want to come over and hold him while he screams? That’s the reality of it.
NONE	As the mainstream media also continues to side-step this issue, one has to understand that this is not just about helping private schools owners.
FAVOR	Schools in Scotland and Wales are shutting as of Friday. While in England the schools are still open.   We need to keep all our children safe from this deadly Coronavirus.  England will be the only nation in Europe to keep schools open. #covid19UK  #coronavirus
NONE	The school and college are starting and colleges are increasing fees in this lockdown,they are not going to teach us practically nor they can pay attention every student,why are they increasing fees and taking all fees together,please do something about this sir

FAVOR	Ya know, people always say that “the children are our future”. Then bitch, why are you sending your future into the most dangerous place to be during a global pandemic?? choices. 
FAVOR	COVID-19 community spread cases in my community (including a student) and just got a donation request from my school district for disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer as the schools are running out and both are back ordered.  Hmm...maybe they should..
FAVOR	@twobluecats I couldn’t agree more! #DeVosKillsChildren #DeVosMustGo #KeepSchoolsClosed
FAVOR	It's also ironic the GOP is now in the business of forcing public school policy through big government. What happened to local control? And now saying the safest place for your child during a pandemic is in government schools, and schools better open up, or else...
AGAINST	@AngelaTeague12 @KTULNews Considering the younger population is much less impacted by the virus, there really isn’t a reason to keep schools closed. Plus, a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics encourages “having students physically present in school.”
AGAINST	Will someone please explain to me why everything can open back up, but schools full of children who are the least affected by this virus that 99% recover from remain closed??
FAVOR	Trump doesn’t care about the 135,000 Americans that have died on his watch. His cronies have been released from prison due to the coronavirus. Do you really think he cares about our children?
FAVOR	@ASlavitt No school is worth attending if it means your kid’s/kids’funeral, memorial service or cremation will be held w/in about 3 wks, more or less because of it!   #COVID19
AGAINST	Is shutting down schools going to affect teacher and learner's mental health?   #OurFutureNeedsYou #WellnessWednesday
NONE	I'm thinking we don't need a vaccine for a virus with a 99.46% survival rate. Seriously?  #NoMaskMandates  #OPENAMERICANOW
FAVOR	I wonder if @realDonaldTrump, @BetsyDeVosED and @IngrahamAngle would change their minds about the dangers of schools fully opening if they were the ones walking the halls of the schools &amp; sitting in the song circles at daycares  #COVID19
NONE	It’s not ideal, but it solves part of the issue. Teachers would be in their own classrooms, there’s really not an issue of cross contamination like there would be with the hybrid or full return model. Maybe something to think about? #onted #COVID19 
FAVOR	@News24 That's not a good idea for schools to open its cold now n Corona works when it's cold so please man not now ...
AGAINST	@BillSchammert The problem buried on this fear mongering whine is that it is based on the assumption that schools are for teachers and staff.  They are not.  Schools are for the students who still need to be educated and need the social interaction and opportunities they provide.
FAVOR	Schools won't shut down because the government is if certain the problem is with alcohol and cigarettes
FAVOR	@Acosta The science should be the only thing that matters to reopen schools
NONE	The body running its own schools cannot be the body regulating other schools.
FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED u are such a disgusting, disgraceful, ignorant, lying, useless piece of crap! The fact that u would send your own grandchildren back 2 school let alone any child makes complete sense 4 the type of heartless person u are. #COVID19 #coronavirus 
FAVOR	@NYCSchools won’t close because parents can’t afford to lose working hours or will struggle to find childcare and some students eat their main meals at school. The system is broken and ultimately there may be some serious consequences down the road. #COVID19
NONE	Jah Prayzah - Mukwasha song is too lit, Waiting for the tiktok challenge #mukwasha   #malema  #MakhadziOnSABC1 #CloseTheGraves
NONE	Across India, a whole spectrum of parents and the government have taken to systematic outrage and criticising of school's charging fees in the lockdown period. They say the phones, laptops and broadband charges are expensive and unnecessary.
AGAINST	You know @realDonaldTrump you did it all wrong. You where suppose to demand that all schools stay closed, that way all schools would be opening!
FAVOR	Everyday parents choose to send their kids to schools understanding there are risks, be it bulling to shootings. My Sons school was locked down 4 times last year, 3 guns, 1 bomb threat. Schools haven’t been safe for awhile. This is simply one more thing to consider.
AGAINST	@sxdoc They're pushing the online BS. ENOUGH! Children need to go back to school - no masks- interact with their peers and get in school hands on learning with a Teacher. Parents NEED to get back to work to support their families! This is absolute MADNESS! #WakeUpAmerica
FAVOR	School nurse when kid gets Coronavirus: here's some ice
AGAINST	#Save our schools
NONE	#Lowes #HomeDepot get this guys trending to require mask like all the other big chains have done! APPLY THE PRESSURE!
AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump Little Doug Ducey will not open the Schools but teachers will continue to be paid while kids are taught at home by Moms and Dads on a Computer. This makes no sense. ! Charter Schools have plans in place for re opening why cant public schools?
FAVOR	Lowkey the only way I’m progressing in education is if they close schools so...who tryna catch it:grin: #coronavirus
NONE	Teachers are humans too. We need salaries. And decent ones are enough. This lockdown has been heavy on all of us and we need to come together as a community instead of promoting disharmony. The school is a sacred institution. It cannot be equated with profits.
FAVOR	France: 15-day lockdown Spain and Italy: indefinite lockdown Germany and Canada: closed borders EU: about to ban all travel for 30 days  ...UK: hmm, well, yeah, could you please like try and not spread coronavirus guys x  #CoronavirusOutbreak #SchoolClosure
NONE	#SaveOurSchools When other states are exploring options on how to ensure education for all, here we are focussed on disturbing what’s working. How will schools function without fees? How will teachers teach without salaries? #SaveOurSchools @imBhupendrasinh
FAVOR	Something I keep thinking about... look at all the people that refuse to wear masks in public, even when mandated by the state. Are they going to tell their kids not to wear one in school? Yep. So do schools turn them away? Not let them on the bus?
NONE	#OurStudents are everything for us. Self financed schools are not asking for anything more than enough #helpourstudents #PMOIndia @Tges_Official
AGAINST	@GovNedLamont @pfizer Why do we need a vaccine!  We have clearly reached herd immunity here in CT.  Why would anyone take a new vaccine with possible side effects? #OPENAMERICANOW
NONE	We will save our schools for educating the future of  our kids.
FAVOR	This Coronavirus lark is getting out of hand! I think it's time to close the schools :wink:
FAVOR	I saw my son's high school principal walk down the supermarket aisle in the wrong direction. His daughter corrected him &amp; he was annoyed. This is the man I am trusting to follow CDC guidelines to head back to school? #FloridaCovidEpicenter #Floridacoronavirus
AGAINST	@Davos tells us that this is the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Digital citizenry is key, digital illiteracy will take us out of the race. @PMOIndia &amp; @imBhupendrasinh Please don’t stop schools &amp; online learning but EXTEND it to everyone. #SaveOurSchools

NONE	@RepValDemings But...but...but you said masks prevent everything!  All wear masks and
FAVOR	373 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus in the UK and six deaths. The numbers are only expected to rise - surely the safest options would be to temporarily close schools whilst more research is done on COVID-19 ?!
FAVOR	Trump wants you to hurt your own child by opening schools for his reelection.
FAVOR	People will surprise you. They want schools to be shut, the power is in your hands, don't send your kids to school, why do we want to be told that schools are shut before doing so. if everyone doesn't send their kids to school there wont be a school.
NONE	The jobs of all the people who r working in schools r in stake now a days. Parents r not ready to pay even monthly fees.salary deduction is going on. many people lost their jobs due to insufficient funds.Govt should take some strict action to save education sector
FAVOR	@Acosta @PressSec  1. Read real science. 2. &amp; other countries can reopen schools because THEY did the hard work: shutdowns, masks, tests, tracing &amp; isolating. We didn't. 3. Look at Israel. They are closing up schools now.  Children over Trump's campaign, please.
FAVOR	Schools are not safe because of all the ANTIFA SCHOOL SHOOTERS that will be happening..
FAVOR	“Students need to return to the classroom so their parents can return to work.” -Donald Trump  “Kids are actually stoppers of the virus." -Betsy DeVos  THIS is who decided to reopen schools.   These 2 liars are okay risking OUR kids’ health &amp; lives. #NotMyKid
FAVOR	I'd rather a child be held back a grade than to wipe out their immediate family members with this contagion. #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus #Covid19
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan My son has asthma and I have multiple autoimmune problems so we decided online was the way to go. A couple of weeks later @CobbSchools agreed that everyone should attend online. I for one commend them for it. It won't be easy but it is necessary! #Schools
NONE	For those interested, Join our WhatsApp community via the link above for more details about the competition. @UnifiedCamp #Students #Essay #contest #onlineeducation #onlinelearning #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	I want my kids out of school now. If coronavirus comes into this home it will be through the petri dishes where they spend their daylight hours.
FAVOR	My school only washes lunch tables with pure water; NOTHING ELSE. Fast and efficient way to get coronavirus.
FAVOR	Schools will perfectly help me spread. - The Virus:microbe:
FAVOR	schools that are not closing right now is insane to me... are ppl WAITING for someone to get coronavirus and then close? i understand that there are some obstacles with closing but there has to be solutions out there. i shouldn’t be going to school tomorrow!
NONE	If all are adopting  new techniques  of working  than why private schools  can not?   Please think over the resolution made on ' No school No fees'. We teachers  are working  hard beyond our boundaries, leaving all personal family responsibilities to serve kids.
AGAINST	#SaveOurSchools Don't discourage the schools and teachers by stopping their salaries @imBhupendrasinh #RightToTeach @vijayrupanibjp @HRDMinistry
FAVOR	Kids go to school so they can learn, not so you can work. Not so they can die. #COVID19 #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	Learning should be constant...then . Why not in covid situation ? Teachers are learning new ways, technology to reach out all the students .... Students have also  accepted the change to learn through virtual classes.... Schools should be on and on and on
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump @CNN No testing. No tracing. No back to schools!
NONE	The moment I saw the press conference live streaming to reopen schools I was thinking
NONE	@business Dear #QAnon ! First amend the #racist laws ! Try 2 skip selfishness in dealing with the #coronavirus pandemic !  The Zionists of th Congress have killed thousands of #Americans because #Trump found it shameful to change his mind about the necessity of wearing a mask!

FAVOR	Kiddo has been homeschooled for years. If it's possible and available, I hope that can be done. 
FAVOR	@apriestOEA So the State Board chickened out. Isn’t it time to SUE THE STATE? Schools SHOULD NOT OPEN, PERIOD! Please help us. OEA is our last resort. Thank you.
FAVOR	Grade 12 learners are also kids and they're also important like others. Just shutdown schools.:nerd_face: @DBE_SA @SadtuNational
FAVOR	@CDCDirector @CDCgov Re-opening schools in the middle of a Pandemic is a colossal mistake and you are losing credibility by recommending this. Thousands of kids could get sick badly and Teachers could lose their lives. But you and this administration don't care about American People
FAVOR	I think I sorta get this now, I’m for waiting until after Labor Day to send kids back to school if that’s okay. Still if people can wear a mask or stay home then this whole pandemic will end. So please stay home or wear a mask.
AGAINST	@murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump There is no substitute for human interaction, @murray_nyc    Virtual learning certainly has some benefits, but students are not getting certain things from virtual learning. Combine that with social isolation and the impact that has on kids.
FAVOR	@MotherJones A study of 39 families. What a joke to base opening schools on.
FAVOR	In this critical time of Covid-19 pandemic outbreak where every parent was worried about their child's future, the initiative of adopting online education is appreciable &amp; a blessing in disguise.
FAVOR	This is so stupid. Someone has to fricking get corona virus in order for the school to close :face_with_rolling_eyes:
AGAINST	If schools don't open this fall, can we just drop the kids off at Walmart for 7 hours?
NONE	@DonaldJTrumpJr   If a healthy person is diagnosed with #coronavirus and dies from any other cause, like hit by a bus or anything, our state government counts that as a #Covid19 death.   These numbers are so damn flawed.   Very frustrating.   #GOP
FAVOR	@Rosie I am a registered nurse. With over 15 years experience in pediatric and vaccines. Do not under any circumstances send your children to school. Do not do it. It will be a catastrophe, disease will spread, bringing COVID-19 virus into your homes and family. #

NONE	Ayo this coronavirus gonna fuck us up even more.
AGAINST	@Theresa_Chapple @jsrsba Honestly I seriously doubt they died FROM covid.   Would be nice to know details. Do you know how many children died from the flu and also on the way to school last year.  Also how many died of child abuse during lockdown ? Life’s complicated
FAVOR	What are you waiting for? @RepRalphNorman @grahamblog @SenatorTimScott  @scsenategop #coronavirus #southcarolina Close the schools!
AGAINST	Incidentally, only service that has faced bans all though the pandemic, is the education sector!  Looks like blinding the nation is the next best strategy to avoid any resistance!
FAVOR	When trump says,"You don't have to wear a mask." I'm wearing a mask. When trump says"Covid is a hoax." I know it's real. When trump says"Beaches,bars &amp;casinos must open." I'm staying home.  When trump insists,"Children should go to school," during a pandemic. I shout

AGAINST	@nowondernotruth @RobManess @CassandraRules Republican, Trump Train Teacher here wanting to get back to work! Haven't been paid since schools closed in March. More teachers are def liberals but I'd say it's 70%/30%. #RightTeachers
FAVOR	It my opinion schools should stay closed not just cusse of corona  
FAVOR	@Mike_Pence @VP @UofSC Yet, 85 infants have been diagnosed with covid!! You think school kids are gonna keep their masks on all day? Wash their hands every single time they need to? Not scream, yell, sing, spit on another kid or school staff?! Wake the hell up!!! #pencemakesnosense
FAVOR	@trudykeil We don't know if many kids will be crippled for life by the plague yet. In 20 years we'll probably have a good idea about how seriously we should have kept kids safer at home for another year until the vaccine will hopefully be available.
AGAINST	@BillOReilly It’s seriously insulting how #Democrats think we’re all stupid and/or naïve :rage: i’ll tell you where I am, cut off all #federal funding for any who dont comply w opening schools There’s no reason for it!Wear :mask: and keep 5ft distance, hand sanitizers stations

FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump How can a child dream when dead? #schools
AGAINST	@dbongino As a teacher, I agree!!! The students are suffering without schools open and data shows there is very very low risk to kids. Teachers can mitigate risk to themselves and others. I need to teach my students where they thrive,  which is AT SCHOOL
NONE	Wake up India &amp; decide what you want for your schools: Thrive or Die? Gujarat Govt order banning schools from charging legitimate fee for online learning is short sighted populism. We need leadership, not knee jerk reactions. @CMOGuj @PMOIndia @imBhupendrasinh
AGAINST	The World needs almost 69 million new teachers to reach the 2030 Education goals. How will we hire and retain good talent in our schools if we cannot pay them well?  @CMOGuj @imBhupendrasinh  #SaveOurSchools
FAVOR	Trump said it in his interview with CBS. He wants to open up schools so more people can go back to work to improve the economy.  Then said they don’t want to do it because it will help me.  Sorry nobody is going to sacrifice my grandchildren.

NONE	Do you know why there are no new schools coming up in Gujarat? Guess what FRC, RTE and host of draconian regulations.
FAVOR	@BetsyDeVosED you are crazy if you think the NBA and all it’s resources in a bubble aren’t able to keep Covid out, but the extremely underfunded schools are going to be able to.
FAVOR	And yes, I've decided to homeschool &amp; I know that's not an option for everyone, but it's very blasé to say "Just keep your kid home" because those kids &amp; teachers will be spreading it to their families &amp; others &amp; into the community. Reopening schools is a big mistake.

FAVOR	@GaydosKTAR Trump has cancelled the RNC Convention in Jacksonville, FL due to concerns about #covid19.   Gov.

NONE	@ReginahMhaule @DBE_SA  The @CyrilRamaphosa announcement that public school will close means that private schools remain open? Theoretically yes, is the ministry saying that there's no #COVID19 in private schools? #schools
FAVOR	Why are schools still open????? Mr President you and your cabinet are bloody clueless

NONE	@donwinslow #TrumpFailedAmerica  and  the #TrumpVirus  is running rampant through America.
AGAINST	Unions vow to shut schools down as Covid-19 continues to claim teacher's lives.   Should these unions be successful and schools are closed, do you think that teachers should still receive their full salaries and why?
NONE	Vaccine or no vaccine were BACK I quote the Dotard in the oval office
FAVOR	@ProjectLincoln This COVID-19 data move away from the CDC has cemented my decision not to send my kids back to school in the fall. With the facts being covered up, there's no way to make an informed decision on risk.
FAVOR	Someone in my town has CoVID-19 and they have yet to cancel school.
FAVOR	9/ Bottom line: If we value Black and Latinx lives, we should only open schools if it’s 100% safe to do so.   Facts are facts.

AGAINST	@adarsh_lohd @Francis_Joseph @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp Fee reduction can be implemented but to stop schools to collect fees completely is not fair &amp; not just teachers or schools but even parents are against this order.
NONE	I Personally Feel Like Schools Should Be Mispromistimanilatigated Right Now!!!!!!!
AGAINST	@nycjim @PressSec Every European country has their schools open No Super Spreaders get a grip open up the schools . . As far as the PresSec people make mistakes  everyone knows it was a slip of the tongue.
NONE	@columbusmonthly Guess what. Schools closed for 1 MONTH
FAVOR	I just learnt that I have to WAIT until someone in my school to get the coronavirus. if that happens then I will get it, right!
AGAINST	They’ve had 5 months to get the schools opened fully and safely. 5 months!!! No excuses. 5 months!! What a bunch of bull.
NONE	The Government has ruined the education system the time they started the system to pass every child till Std 8th..now also everyone is thinking schools make profit.What about the staff and their families who are completely dependent on the salary given by school?
FAVOR	In a statement from DBE it said 80% of kids are gng to school which means good progress on their side... nna kere the power is in our hands by not taking our kids to school that way they will b forced to shutdown schools:person_in_lotus_position:
AGAINST	@SNNTV @ValezkaSNN Spring quarter four online schooling was a disaster.  Focus on the facts of the virus and who is most at risk.  The risk of not going to school far outweighed the risk of Coronavirus.
FAVOR	@FallonTonight I hope you’re going to ask @NYGovCuomo to explain his plan to kill 300 NYC school children by reopening the schools in the midst of the first wave of a global pandemic.
NONE	What if we were given scientific proof that Covid-19 is waterborne??:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::person_shrugging::person_shrugging: #WhatsApp  #July31
FAVOR	I’m homeschooling this year. Not risking my daughter over someone who doesn’t understand wind and thinks the enemy is a friend.
AGAINST	We aren't against teachers we are just against this system. Just think, education that is a base of the future of an individual is fully dependant on apps. Ans for that schools are taking fees and  teachers aren't paid if they are unable to teach online.
AGAINST	@JPGofGET @EducateCT @GovNedLamont Most parents want schools open!!!
FAVOR	For those so “pro-life” you want me to sacrifice my children and myself (teacher) for “normalcy”. Funny how the D’s are accused of making masks political, while Trump &amp; ilk sacrificed 100k Americans &amp; are now coming for the children to win an election/raise economy!
NONE	@lsingh_77 Laxman Singh ji TUITION fee payment is not the issue. D issue is the mindset. Not everyone is without money &amp; not everyone has lost the job. The mindset that schools are closed so we wouldn’t pay fee is poisonous. Schools are considering genuine fee issues so plz
FAVOR	You know the best solution if public school systems refuse to close down, to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for every parent and child call in sick.  Even if your child is not sick, someone will be if schools remain open during this pandemic.
FAVOR	@MaryEllenKlas @GovRonDeSantis FL #Covid19 cases are going :arrow_up: not :arrow_down:. @GovRonDeSantis re-evaluate that. The workers within the school system are mainly in the "high risk" Bus Drivers, Teachers, Aides, Administration, Custodial, and support staff.  #SocialDistance in already overcrowded classes??
AGAINST	@conunlibro @MiamiSup @ariodzernbc6 Don't agree, open schools and gjve parents choice of remote learning. Which by the way it's not working.
NONE	We are all one voice supporting what we believe will enable #gujarat to do what’s right for its every resident - be it schools, parents, teachers and the children @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp
AGAINST	Anyone opposing the shut down of schools is crook.
FAVOR	What about the kids are being forced to go back to school because their parents are virus/pandemic deniers? Our kiddos are more aware than some give them credit for. That’s not an environment that promotes learning. That’s an environment that can create PTSD.
NONE	In regard to this, the Gujarat Government decided that parents did not have to pay fees and that term fees paid so far since the lockdown be refunded by schools to parents. This decision come as an extremely insensitive and dangerous step.
FAVOR	@CovfefeKatie Katie, This is great if you are gathering info and making a list. If schools don't open parents should pull there kids out of public school and seek a better alternative. #kidsfirst
AGAINST	Since teachers are afraid to reopen schools for the fear of catching Covid, then maybe we should just bring the classroom to Walmart since most of them probably have no problem going in there.
FAVOR	1/ I’ve got a solution. Why don’t then school districts just give us our summer vacation early. We could end school mid March and resume school in mid June if #coronavirus is contained. The 2019-2020 school year could be finished during what would have been...
AGAINST	If K-12 schools don’t open, why do I have to pay for 70% of my property taxes when I will essentially be teaching my own children. Sorry, but watching YouTube videos &amp; answering questions are not teaching/learning.
FAVOR	@Acosta So I guess trumpedo administration is abolishing science in schools. Cuz what it’s the point to teach children science if adults (not all of them but the stupid ones) don’t believe in it. Anyway my daughter is NOT going to face to face school this fall.
FAVOR	Grown ass people are constantly throwing temper tantrums over wearing a mask to grocery shop for 30 mins, but kids, especially non neurotypical kids, can absolutely wear a mask for 7 hours a day to go back to school while the politician's kids stay home.
FAVOR	@7News Entering schools and leaving schools. No guessing its not possible to social distance while at school.
FAVOR	@T_R_0_V_3_R @repairrestores1 We all know that opening schools during a raging killer pandemic is criminal and crazy.
NONE	Due to the long shut-down, parents are finding it difficult to pay the school fees. Schools are refraining from pressurising parents on humanitarian grounds.
FAVOR	2020: the year the president urged us to sacrifice children and teachers so that he can hopefully prop up the stock market by a few points thereby slightly increasing his chances of keeping a job he hates.  #SchoolReopening #schoolsreopening
NONE	How are they going to pay teachers when they can't afford to pay R350.00 for Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant.
FAVOR	@fred_guttenberg @donwinslow @JoeBiden It's not only about children. It's also about what they are going to bring home. It's also about adults, parents, esp. grandparents and so on. Look at Israel. They opened the schools and next thing was an explosion of cases among children AND adults.
FAVOR	We still need to engage on the matter of schools We support teachers on this one   #mbali  #TsongaDrive  ##SchoolMustClose
FAVOR	so glad my jurisdiction is doing distance learning and not sending my children back to the coronavirus box in the fall. I'm just out of chemo so I might as well lay down in the road outside of the school and wait for somebody to run me over if they went back
FAVOR	Indian talent + Information technology = India Tomorrow Why are we averse to #OnlineClasses then? Why do you want schools and kids not to have that option? @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp

FAVOR	@GovParsonMO  Your CALLOUS attitude on #SchoolReopening, not caring kids, teachers, family will get &amp; spread virus is deplorable!  You forgot we're the SHO-ME STATE. You're not showing good leadership or #facts that Missouri spread &amp; deaths won't get worse!
FAVOR	literally everyone at my school is sick. everyome. maybe jot with the corona virus but everyonen is sick, coughng, sneezing, literally everywhere.
FAVOR	@seanmdav If Malls are not opening because of concerns with recirculated air #Ventilation HVAC systems spreading Coronavirus. Schools with sealed windows, interior classrooms, &amp; the same recirculated air ventilation that fans #Coronavirus around shouldn't open.
AGAINST	@Lrihendry Schools are shut down but teachers still getting paid. No wonder teachers don’t want schools to reopen.
NONE	@robreiner With the help of the Republican Party! #TrumpVirus
NONE	Save the Education Save the Schools Save the Teachers save the Students
FAVOR	Public schools will start out with remote learning at the beginning of the school year here in North Texas.  Private schools have not made the same announcement.  So my kid will not be saturated in neither COVID nor smug privilege while learning this year.
NONE	@anubha1812 Regular audit is done by Income Tax Dept and Edu Dept. It is assuming to hear that everyone outside the official system can do a better job. Please don’t speedy falsehoods. 95% of private schools charge less than RS 1000 per month
AGAINST	#ReopeningSchools with social distancing  and face mask is new world order environment of torture, loss of identity, loss of human touch, with fear of others. Fate sealed for student experimentation of any form, destroying what it is to be human.
FAVOR	I’m absolutely scared silly about this coronavirus. I want to batten down the hatches and keep my babies home till it blows over #COVID2019uk
NONE	2. It's definitely World War 3!   Coronavirus is the Invisible Enemy!  Mass graves... being dug out... that sounds like a War to me.   But how do we win?   Where do we run to?   How do we survive to tell the story?
AGAINST	If market places are still ruining where transactions are made and advise to keep social distancing. While not open schools where acquisitions are gain and also advise to be observing social distancing? Still educators are receiving salary. We say no to stay at home
NONE	I would like to hear from other parents about schools reopening. Amie is 16, she has flat out told me she won't go back until a vaccine exists. #COVID19 
FAVOR	Definitely keeping my kids home until there is a tested, wide spread vaccine.
AGAINST	I don’t understand why #teachers are so reluctant to go back to #school. Many of us have been working safely, coming in contact with numerous people without problems, since the beginning of the pandemic. It’s time to get dressed and go back to work! #COVID19
FAVOR	Like realistically what’s the point in having school tomorrow amid this coronavirus outbreak...
NONE	2 months ago my doctor told me that I don't qualify to test for #COVID19 and that my medical aid won't cover it. Where do you guys get tested and how much exactly is it?
NONE	Anyone who would strap a mask on their child's face for 5 minutes let alone 7 hours should be jailed for child abuse.    Any Dr. who recommends putting a mask on a child should be stripped of their medical license - at the minimum.
NONE	Has anyone in #SouthAfrica got any updates on the closing of schools? Has the @DBE_SA said anything yet?
NONE	@maryannemarsh @AmericaNewsroom @tracegallagher @JulieBanderas @david_avella @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @FoxNews "The ONLY POLL THAT MATTERS will take place → November 3, 2020" - #SilentMajorityRising   #itsover4democrats #democrats #wrong4America #liberals #wrong4TheWorld #Marxists #wrong4TheUniverse   #FLIPTheHouse #HoldTheSenate #4MoreYears   #OpenAmerica

FAVOR	@INCPunjab @capt_amarinder Its a request to please close the Schools n colleges for at least a fortnight owing to the threat of coronavirus. Else We would be putting children’s lives under threat. #COVID19india
FAVOR	I am sick to my stomach over the thought that there are districts informing #teachers to update their wills and having both children and teachers sign waivers over dying. We are not at a point of safety to open schools properly.
AGAINST	Markets are open,church's are doing there business, preparations for election in Edo Etc.. Yet schools are closed..and one inconsiderate mortal opened mouth and said  student should miss one academic year...mtcheeeew ..political nonsense..
FAVOR	Trump and the Republican party- abortion is a sin and it's murdering babies. Also Trump and the Republicans- We are completely reopening schools this fall and we don't care if kids die due to the virus. The hypocrisy here.
FAVOR	Think how devastated you'll feel if you DON'T keep your kid at home and he or she is one of those who die from Covid19. Let that sink in, parents...because it will happen. #keepyourchildhome #WearAMask
AGAINST	Shutting down schools may leave us teachers with No Work No Pay

FAVOR	#SchoolReopening why is it so hard for us blacks to work together &amp; be united mare? If we all agreed not to send kids to school, government will be forced to listen &amp; close schools. I say us blacks cause whites can afford good health care #SchoolStayaway
FAVOR	Remote learning is not perfect, but it can improve enormously with more focus on fewer subjects at a time.   Children CAN die of Covid-19, as can teachers, all school staff, and family members.   Covid-19 leaves longterm damage we are just learning about.
AGAINST	@burpytrolls me either, fauci, pediatricians majority say open them, they can go to daycare, camps, amusememt parks, but not schools, cause trump said it...wtf... that is total partisanship bs...

FAVOR	No vaccine, no school!  Kids are required to show vaccine records to set foot on any public school campus. Now we are letting that slide so they can pass around COVID and risk dying?
AGAINST	@imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj Your order is equivalent. How can schools teach without getting paid?
AGAINST	#SaveOurSchools Learning is a fundamental right that no child should be deprived of. #RightToLearn #RightToTeach How will that happen if you stop schools? @vijayrupanibjp @HRDMinistry
FAVOR	#AngieMotshega @CyrilRamaphosa @Lesufi close the schools until after the peak period of #COVID19SouthAfrica infection rates, this Karim guy who leads your scientific advisory committee is working for @BillGates; Save the lives of our people

AGAINST	Studies have  shown that the chances of children contracting  COVID-19 are next to nil . Stop throwing shade for your corrupt teachers unions .
FAVOR	Schools in Durham, North Carolina will be closed until after the general election November 3rd 2020. Democrats in Durham are science deniers.
AGAINST	@BlueyBlur @GovNedLamont @teachcardona Absolutely, those who are comfortable with proper protocols should be able to bring their kids fir 5 days schools.

NONE	@KatLaRue7 I don’t think it’s a hoax, but I do feel it’s been politicized and exaggerated now.  I wear a mask and gloves in public cause I choose to. Not because of all the conflicting news stories out there..:kissing_heart::kissing_heart:

FAVOR	I don't care that I have to go to school, I just prefer not to catch a disease that, even though because I'm a child and the survival rate with #COVID19 with children is high, could be brought home to my house and kill my parents. I know it's unlikely, but still.
FAVOR	@DrZweliMkhize This thing is bad, I knew of someone I was traveling with , that passed away, the guy was never off-sick, healthy and all. Covid is shit...man. And schools are still open @angie_motshekga

FAVOR	@CrazyPKAY Its An Unfair Burden To Place On Teachers If The Parents Let Their Kids Do As They Please.   Also, With Cases Being Reported At Schools Everyday It Is Only Right For
FAVOR	@trudykeil Sending kids to the front-lines where many adults won't go, including the politicians making this boneheaded decision, makes as much sense as bicycles for fish.
FAVOR	...technically closing schools would stop the spread of the corona virus sooo, what do ya say school system? close the schools.
FAVOR	The colder it becomes the higher the level of Covid-19 cases rise...our children aren’t coping at all. Although the curriculum has to be covered mara not like this,come on now! Most of the learners are in hospitals right now, so what’s the use grand sharp?
AGAINST	Reopen the schools because online classes are not benefitting us,they are causing more troubles.
NONE	Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy is self-isolating as a precaution after a member of his family was admitted to hospital displaying symptoms of #coronavirus #bbcqt #Birmingham #Birminghamupdates
NONE	Why don’t the small percentage of parents who feel that online education is useless withdraw their children from private schools and admit them in free govt. schools with highly paid and qualified teachers? Why make majority of parents and students suffer?
FAVOR	Schools will be closing until further notice :crossed_fingers: #cyrilramaphosa
AGAINST	Ok, so we can't trust educators to safe distance or wear masks? Why in the hell are we letting them teach our children?
NONE	@rhonda_harbison @WontSurvive4mor @EricTrump Illegal for being over the allowed donation limit. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie.
FAVOR	#schoolsmustshutdown You just closed/banned alcohol,the reason was/is you are protecting us from Covid 19 because it's extremely increasing everyday yet since schools re-opened teacher's and learner's have added to the  increasingly number #pleaseprotectus
AGAINST	Since when does the government think homeschooling is the "thing to do"? I remember when they tried outlawing it!
AGAINST	@GovAbbott I’ll bet that if the Feds were offering :moneybag: to open schools, you’d mandate they open ASAP. Stop the delay in #MclennanCounty
NONE	The only positive thing about the coronavirus is that my school finally ends up replacing the soap and hand sanitizer every day now instead of once or twice a week
FAVOR	In case anyone is wondering my children will not be attending public schools in the fall. #COVID19 #schoolviolence #sexualharassment #SystemicRacism  #bullying #TeachersLivesMatter #SocialInjustice need more reasons? #backtoschool
FAVOR	Everyone is so "Pro-Life" until parents just want to keep their child(ren) safe during a pandemic and government officials demand we re-open schools. Tell me, is it a "return to normalcy" when their classmates start dying?
FAVOR	@REVMusicNY GOP WANT TO OPEN SCHOOLS AND KILL OUR BABIES. ITS TIME TO LET THEM KNOW , SEND YOUR CHILD/CHILDREN FIRST .
FAVOR	@B52Malmet Well, that says it all! #StayAtHome

FAVOR	Apparently @SarahHuckabee wants her children to die in #TrumpsAmerica . :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: #TrumpVirus
AGAINST	@GOP @realDonaldTrump That is not what they said. And you know that. They want schools to open safely ONLY if the spread of COVID-19 in an area is under CONTROL. But given the GOP and this administration’s completely botched response in handling this pandemic, that will NOT be possible.
FAVOR	The impact of #COVID19 will be disastrous in Africa. Some Parents still allow their kids to do as they will: this is irresponsible. Most of these kids are roaming around without face masks. Government has No Plan:We must be Vigilant &amp; Stay Indoors. #WearAMask
FAVOR	I understand the importance of education, but doesn't safety come first? We have already had many scares with corona virus cases on campus but we keep out schools open? Are we waiting for an outbreak? Come on Colorado.
AGAINST	@ZacBissonnette That video, my god. I'm as progressive as the next person and I dearly hope Trump will lose, but I can't remember the last time I watched such a cynical, fear-mongering piece of propaganda. Keeping schools closed will be devastating for our most vulnerable children.
FAVOR	@CDCgov  no longer gets data. It goes to the White House. Great. The country we relied on to keep us safe and that said the virus is a hoax. Now has contol over the numbers we see. And he wants schools open
FAVOR	Literally everyday now I commute to school while reading in the news how the number of infected ppl from the corona virus is increasing and @CUNY just keeps sending emails instead of coming with an actual prevention plan that let us stay home...

AGAINST	@CalmdeezNutz Only idiots close schools! The science days children don't get the #KungFlu!
FAVOR	I have to take biologic immunosuppression injections that stay in my system for 3 months. I live with my brother who has to go University every day bringing fear to him and me. We are both scared I could die of i get coronavirus.
FAVOR	@joshi_speaks @zoneanthony @anubha1812 I think best option for parents who are not satisfied with online classes is to shift to government schools or take a drop of one year. Many parents are happy with the online classes and let them take the advantage of it.

FAVOR	There are solutions out there for all of our public services including Parliament schools Etc where they could use video conferencing solutions to continue to meet and teach remotely. This would be a low-cost yet effective solution. #remoteworking #COVID19
AGAINST	@rezaaslan This shouldn't be a partisan issue...time to put our kids future first...The flu is far more dangerous to our children than COVID, studies have shown they are minimal spreaders of the virus and the rest of Europe has opened schools with no problems. #flattenthefear
FAVOR	@realTiffyCat @scdhec I pray that SCDHEC stays transparent. I heard today that our incompetent governor is directing SCDHEC to change the way they report their numbers. to not give people enough information, so McMaster can do Trump’s bidding in opening our schools without restrictions.
AGAINST	Defund Teachers if you don't reopen schools.  #ReOpenSchools
FAVOR	But now it’s ok to send them to school meanwhile #coronavirus it’s still infecting anyone  There’s no cure No vaccine No treatment   &amp; something like #WearAMaskSaveALife is a fighting issue  Parents Listen to Science Facts Medical Experts  Your children depend on you
AGAINST	If teachers are essential then return to work and do their job. If they're not essential that's fine. Close the schools, give the money to the kids, and let the parents educate their children. You can't refuse to go to work but still get paid.
AGAINST	The order is arbitrary. They have banned schools from functioning and we have edtech companies like byjus and vedantu promoting it at the same time. Why these double standards?  #SaveOurSchools
AGAINST	First they included BPL students in private schools through RTE. Than they controlled fees through FRC. And now they don't want schools to collect fees and yet give education. What habit and trend are we creating for our future?
FAVOR	@realDonaldTrump It's too dangerous to hold the RNC, but let's send students and teachers back to school  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
FAVOR	@donwinslow @PressSec We ALL want schools to open, but we want it done when it’s safe. It isn’t safe now.
FAVOR	If you fail to protect a child that is called neglect. Any parent that sends their child back to school in the middle of this #TrumpVirus should be charged accordingly. I would be in jail, no way in hell would I put mine in known danger. #schoolsreopening #COVID19
FAVOR	Many people are asking if Barron is going back to school. Of course not. I care about HIS life. A little. Believe me. #SchoolReopening #schoolchoicenow #coronavirus #COVID #Covid_19 #COVIDー19

FAVOR	We send our children to schools so they get quality education and become something great in future - except being a teacher. And yet one who makes them all is ignored. Irony or hypocrisy?
FAVOR	Betsy DeVos wants to force children into crowded schools during a pandemic because teaching kids that Republicans don't care if they live or die is the closest thing to an education that she's willing to give them.
FAVOR	I don’t get why they are waiting for coronavirus to get to schools before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the schools so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it
AGAINST	@Oswego308 @OswegoIL60543 @  @oswegochamber  If our schools don't open in the fall I will be expecting a Tax refund similar to my reduced insurance rates.
NONE	If the fees are to high then bann the electricity bill and gas bills. Can you do this? How can you say this that fees are to high? If you want good education then you have to pay the fees. That's why people their first choice is private schools not government

AGAINST	My school shut down denying me access to my professors due to corona virus over exaggeration...... 2-3k$ for this month down the drain :)
FAVOR	@MollyJongFast Children are not allowed in school if they have a contagious disease.  Letters are sent home informing parents. Just in case. Asymptomatic covid Could quickly infect the entire school. Then the community. It is foolish to contemplate opening until testing is in place.
FAVOR	my school will only close for 48hrs if there’s a coronavirus case and then we’ll all probably have to return to normal as if nothing’s happened. wtf?
AGAINST	My taxes should NOT go to public schools &amp; teachers that don't open  Kids need socialization &amp; keeping them home will harm their psyche. This mandate is pushed by scared adults. Kids' immunities are strongest &amp; their COVID risk is less than any age group

NONE	If Private schools have earned for many years and so should not take fees for a year than logically speaking Government is collecting Taxes since 1947 so they should also give all services like petrol, electricity, water for free for one year. Shouldn't they?
AGAINST	They re - opening the schools because they losing money ... not because it’s safe outside .
FAVOR	The next fucking asshole that tells me there is no data that kids can transmit COVID-19 to others is gonna get dick punched.  Kids haven't been in school and why in the fuck would we want to experiment on our children for the data you assholes require. Go To Hell
NONE	What if there was job loss or pay cut due to recession ? Would government still give decision to not pay fees to schools ? Are schools run by robots ?? Teachers also need to get paid right ?
FAVOR	I know I have like zero followers, but I had to quit my teaching job today because so many #COVIDIOTS think it’s a hoax and my school is going full steam ahead and opening face to face with NO face masks. I’m devastated. I loved my job.
NONE	@AgarkarFatima By that logic, everything private, be it the FMGC industry, or automobile industry, or service sectors, all should provide free of cost services till they go bankrupt. Why only schools!? It's really sad, and makes one question the sanity of the ppl in power. :(

AGAINST	@RahulGandhi The priority of any government should be to provide education to students and not shutting it down. By shutting down schools &amp; online classes,the @CMOGuj government will make Teachers &amp; schools fall into debt trap.The adverse impact of such a move is multifaceted.
FAVOR	This is a wakeup call! Coronavirus can destroy the private education industry that took decades to stand on its feet. If we let it collapse now, it will take decades to build up again.

NONE	Parents need to prepare for the possibility that schools will call the police and/or CPS in the event that they don’t bring their kids to school. Idk if they’ll keep it up, what with the pandemic, but they def did it in SETX (pre-covid) 
NONE	Virtual classes cannot replace physical schools but it does solve the purpose of engaging with students,its only alternative to continue with learning despite the lockdown.
AGAINST	@CMOGuj @HRDMinistry  We teachers thought we are working hard learning technology so that we can go long teaching. Please let schools be on. @vijayrupanibjp
FAVOR	@B52Malmet Our schools are offering either online only or 2 days in person supplemented with online. We chose online only for our HS Junior.  Just got word that the Univ. our college student attends will be online only.

AGAINST	1/4 #FridayVibes @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo @DOEChancellor &amp; all  Mayors/Governors/ SchoolChancellor's  think #COVID19 is biggest concern w #schoolsreopening think again. Parents are more concerned abt safety of kids getting to &amp; from school amid protests, occupations
AGAINST	@EducateCT @GovNedLamont @teachcardona A combination of testing, masks and outdoor activities when possible can help. Let's open our schools for 5 days in person classes.
AGAINST	Schools have to open back up. I understand parents who are concerned, but please, understand the children for whom it’s the only place where they can get a warm meal, for whom it’s a place that keeps them off the streets. Schools offer more than books and tests.
FAVOR	Either you win by dismantling the corrupt school system, or you win when the science is all of a sudden on your side and its ok to open schools. What do you think sir?  #homeschool
FAVOR	I'm privileged to stay home &amp; still work, allowing my kids to stay safe. Most people aren't that lucky. We need schools CLOSED and RELIEF for workers who can't stay home with kids. The economy returns with MANDATED MASKS &amp; a flattened curve, not the other way around.
NONE	If schools will not be  paid by the parents  then how they will pay to their manpower . Either govt will take the responsibility that they will  pay to private teacher until school will not get any fee from parents.
AGAINST	@musicalgal123 @EducateCT There may never be a vaccine - we all have to work
FAVOR	I can tell u for free, @MYANC have so many tenders linked to schools, closing schools will mean closing thier Pockets, They rather see teachers and children with chronic illness dying of Covid-19 than losing thier bite on the 500 billion relief package.
AGAINST	Schools need to go back! Keeping them closed causes parents to stay away from work to homeschool their kids. It holds back the entire economy, and by the way, kids don't die from this disease!
NONE	If government school teachers are being paid full salary then why is this discrimination being done with private schools? Why the order of ban on fees thus no renumeration for educators?  Very sad  but true .
FAVOR	When @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany was pushing @realDonaldTrump's agenda to reopen schools, did I really hear her say, “The science should not stand in the way of this"?  Or am I drunk, high, in a coma...?  #kayleighlies #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpKillsUs  #MAGA

FAVOR	I challenge @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @GovRonDeSantis @BetsyDeVosED  to attend schools 5 days a week, 7 hrs a day when schools reopen. Come on in, sit in a desk, use the kids' restrooms, navigate the crowded halls, ride the bus, sit in the cafeteria if it's so safe.
AGAINST	Strengthen the schooling system don’t break it down... Teachers matter! Students matter! Schools provide the platform :folded_hands_light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	Now Cohen is getting released. Just so we keep the record straight I’d like to remind everyone Covid-19 has made prisons so dangerous that Manafort, Stone, and Cohen are not incarcerated. Meanwhile President Ding Dong is lobbying for kids to be in school.
AGAINST	If teachers don't do their work at schools, then they should not get paid!
NONE	@ClayTravis @JohnCooper4Nash It’s not about masks. It’s about the Teachers Union twisting the tax payers arm for more money. Where does it all end?  Money obviously doesn’t fix failing government schools.
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan Trump said he'd have no problem letting any of his kids go to an American elementary school though Eric might need help with the classwork.#Schools #SchoolsReopening

FAVOR	Shutdown the schools and pay the teachers coz parents pay school fees
FAVOR	@JoeBiden So again, you're going to ignore what's happening in Portland, OR how unauthorized Federal agents are abducting citizens and detaining them without cause? Or are we supposed to also forget that you are in favor of opening schools back up? #PortlandUnderSiege

NONE	@piersmorgan the absolute voice of reason. #coronavirus
FAVOR	Our future is in the hands of our children, is not like am saying this because I left school with grade 7 but schools must be closed.

FAVOR	I think this is just absurd. Really, why are they waiting for kids everywhere to start catching the Coronavirus before starting to close schools? Why not just close the schools NOW to prevent it even getting to that stage?:thinking_face:
FAVOR	@eNCA @SABCNews only PUBLIC schools will be closed??? What happens then to the PRIVATE school kids, are they not prone to contracting COVID-19, or are they moving their learning online? What then of the POOR kids???

FAVOR	Sooo.. #COVID19 is so contagious we release inmates from prison...but safe enough that we can send our children back to school.  Dangerous enough that we're still on lockdown. But safe enough to jeopardize the lives of our babies?  #IRefuse #SendBaron
FAVOR	You can fine me now, I'm not sending my kid to a petri dish of bacteria that is CCSD schools. And that's before the COVID outbreak. They can't protect our kids from each other, there's no way they can against this.
AGAINST	Take sports away and Social Interaction in schools. Your kids will have a great immune system! Way to teach your kids your saving them from the coronavirus. Bill gates and all Ted Talk technocrats have wanted online learning for years. Wake up!

It is a fantasy to think that this won’t be a disaster.
FAVOR	Dear Mme Angie, please note that only 6 Grade Rs out of 90 came to school today. Please tell me why are you still sending kids to school?
FAVOR	@MarkDice @Acosta The science is not "on our side." They keep saying countries which have reopened schools, but those countries have managed the virus, where have not! We are currently averaging 62K new cases a day. She even says we are the outlier. Yeah because Trump F*cked this up!
FAVOR	How about maga teachers and maga students go back to public schools first, joined by 3rd party voters, "sitting this election out" and "writing a name in" voters. After one month, we'll reassess in person classroom instruction. Until then, it's online for our kids!
FAVOR	America is so used to children being gunned down while AT SCHOOL that it seems very easy for them to ready for #COVID19 deaths that are coming for the teachers/students/their families as American schools are being FORCED to reopen for in person education!
FAVOR	@stan_tampa @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump Disgusting is the only word for the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP I’m sorry for your loss I truly am. Let’s pray they don’t actually open #schools
AGAINST	I want to sue Newsom and enjoin his order preventing schools from reopening. Looking for an attorney. #RecallGavinNewsom
FAVOR	@PadmaLakshmi Don't forget the ever popular "we are the outlier here!"  No shit Sherlock, the countries who have reopened schools didn't totally fuck up their response to this virus. We all need to tell #TrumpTheTwitterTwerp #notmykid

FAVOR	@GOP Look what happened in Israel when they opened schools. And they had Covid under control at the time. It's fucking raging here.
AGAINST	How can you go from saying that the biggest protests in the history of the US didn’t cause a spike in coronavirus cases, to saying there isn’t a safe way to send kids back to school? Just require masks. They were good enough for the mass protests.
NONE	@GregAbbott_TX I’ve heard rumors that you will be announcing another lockdown tomorrow.  Texans, how would you feel about this?  #TexasCOVID
FAVOR	Online teaching is also a service &amp; teachers need to be paid. Schools need to survive. Online learning helps increase computer literacy &amp; proficiency - essential skills for school and for life. Your order is regressive.
FAVOR	Homeschooling is the best way ever!
FAVOR	Los Angeles County is still in Scenario II; therefore, BUSD is faced with a Hobson’s Choice. Our students, teachers, and staff have to wait for at least one person to become infected with Coronavirus before we can close schools.
FAVOR	@therecount Sending children to school during a deadly #COVID19 pandemic, is worse than putting your children in cars without seatbelts.  It's playing Russian Roulette with the lives of children.   It's child abuse.   #StayHome
FAVOR	@ResisterDude @GovLarryHogan Boy you are “SPOT ON”!!  DeSantis has his head so far up tRUMP’s a$$ he can’t seem to see the reality of forcing schools to open:confounded::rage::face_with_hand_over_mouth::see_no_evil: #RonDeathSantis  #RonDeSantisResign

FAVOR	My nephew came back from school with news of an alleged positive case of his physical sciences teacher, who also lost his wife to covid.  The school is continuing as usual, keeping things :zipper__mouth_face:  Why weren't teachers &amp; students tested upon returning to schools?
FAVOR	The question is not whether NYC schools will shut down. They will. For sure. The questions is how many #coronavirus cases do we need to get to for our leaders to decide to close them. @BilldeBlasio @NYGovCuomo
AGAINST	@GovStitt if schools do not open, teachers shouldn’t get paid!  The demands &amp; nonsense needs to stop!

NONE	@anubha1812 What if your client says, no fee until you submit him your income and audit details. Respect teachers &amp; schools
FAVOR	It's time for @CDCDirector Robert Redfield to resign. He is willing to sacrifice the lives of his own grandchildren. He just said as much on @GMA  #SchoolReopening
NONE	Now there’s two more reported Coronavirus cases in my county. Literally everyone at my school talks about the Coronavirus and how our school is going to close and such, but at this point, I think that may happen and I will be taking online courses.
FAVOR	Why are the UK schools not closing?? It's absolutely ridiculous! What are you gonna do if one of your students die and it's your fault. Will you even care? It's 2020, any work we do at school we can find online! It makes no sense! #coronavirus @saddleworth_sch
NONE	Children are the future of our nation, in pandemic situation schools and teachers are providing digital education that is so far a need of modern education era. Even our Constitution has given everyone the right of education. For our bright future.........

FAVOR	@MotherJones Schools are petri dishes for any infection like flu .Any study that has been done abt kids is flawed because we protect our children,since March they have not been interacting with other kids. Reopening will cause outbreaks.Teachers,Staff,families  will be affected
NONE	Not collecting fees would make it impossible for schools to continue their essential operations such as digital education delivery, maintaining buildings and infrastructure, increasing sanitation measures. Schools need fees to pay for resources
NONE	@ecaorg @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp @swatipopat Correct... It should be a Win - Win - Win situation for all three - Parents, kids and schools
NONE	Questions of the Day: Do you think kids should return to school in the fall with our current state in the pandemic?  How many of your are actual parents planning for your kids to return to school?  Let me know your thoughts!!!  #Schools #SchoolsReopening
FAVOR	@nbc10_brian @RIHEALTH @GovRaimondo Sort of like how it will be if we stupidly reopen schools next month.
FAVOR	Any district that opens up in August for F2F better not ever use the term “data driven” ever again to describe their academic mission statement if they choose to ignore the overwhelming amount of data telling us to stay home. #SchoolReopening #COVID19
FAVOR	@murpharoo @David_Speers How the hell are kids meant to practice social distancing in classes of 40 kids? No hand sanitizer or even hand soap in toilets. #Morrison is making a mockery of #SocialDistancing #morrisonmixedmessages
FAVOR	@GOP Trump and Republicans WONT EVEN ALLOW THE CDC to give America guidelines to reopen schools. Republicans won’t fund what schools need to be safe. 138,000 deaths aren’t enough? You want to sacrifice our kids too?
NONE	I’m not sure what the right answer is on schools opening.  We need a better debate than privileged people and/or those with no school age children adamantly against it vs. an incompetent president blindly pushing for it.
NONE	The order, even if aimed at populism, is ill informed and ill thought out. It does not help anyone. It just perpetuates the inevitable collapse of hundreds and possibly thousands of schools in the coming months. #SaveOurSchools #education @imBhupendrasinh @CMOGuj
FAVOR	@donwinslow So glad Dekalb County schools doing virtual cause going back to school during this mess!?!

NONE	@anubha1812 @HappyNGIS Everyone has to follow the law. As an Indian I’m also concerned that only good education will allow our children to reach their true potential. Don’t strangle schools by exercising Government control over fees. Don’t strangle our future
FAVOR	Is wrong with this picture? You need to get off your butt and force the mask mandate and quit kissing the failing #individual1’s butt. Newton county just had another death and you want to force our children to go to schools?
NONE	@Francis_Joseph @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp #SaveOurSchools Campaign started by schools .. when we ask for audit report they don't want to share.. with surplus in crores they want to profit even during this pandemic..

FAVOR	@jaketapper Science is NOT on the side of reopening brick and mortar schools!!
AGAINST	Hearing rumblings of a stay-at-home order for Texas w/in 24 hours.  @GovAbbott, don't do it.  Stay the course.  Dusting off my civil disobedience manual.  #TexasCOVID #TexasCovid19 #HerdImmunity
FAVOR	Shut down schools and continuepaying teachers . You pay people for making children so why not somebody who did not choose to put their life on hold ?
FAVOR	Not my grands! We shut down schools with lower numbers!  How does opening them do anything but sacrifice the health/lives of students, teachers, staff, admin?
AGAINST	With schools closed because they cannot afford the costs involved, and lack of stimulus of any kind, unfortunately the students will miss an important part of what they needed to normalise - the teachers @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp @imBhupendrasinh
FAVOR	Don't let #COVID19 shut down your school, move your classes online &amp; reach every student. We can organize the right tools for remote education on any level to keep your students and staff safe. Contact us Today. #coronavirus #CDC #Quarantine #schoolclosures

AGAINST	Dear Teachers, I guarantee there are worse germs in our classrooms than #COVID19 and yet we still signed up for this job.
FAVOR	@jwgop @realDonaldTrump If it’s so safe to send the kids,teachers, staff back to closed rooms, then why is the WH STILL testing everyone that comes in? Why isn’t the WH open for tours?
FAVOR	Several of my @SUNYRockland students are afraid &amp; anxious to be on campus. I told them I respect their concerns &amp; am OK with them going virtual, as long as the Chair &amp; Dean are notified. @SUNYChancellor @SUNY @rockhealth @InsideRockland @Rockland_News #COVID19
AGAINST	Teachers don’t want to return  But health care, daycare, and essential workers have worked for months.  What’s the difference? I honestly don’t understand the resistance. #WearAMask #COVID19 #TeacherSafetyIsEssential #teacher #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	@RiegerReport Do you want to trust the people who cage babies with your children in schools? They. Just. Do. Not. Care. About anyone but their rich friends, who don’t attend public schools. ##NotMyPresident
NONE	Hike in electric charges. Hike in GST for sanitisers and masks. Hike in petrol and diesel charges. No discussion. Fees not to be collected at all. No discussion too. Is system still seems balanced?
FAVOR	Spent two hours at the supermarket, parking, figuring out what to buy when whole sections were empty, and waiting to pay. Definitely not one person per four sq metres. Not the case at my kid's school either. #COVID19
FAVOR	@PressSec If you “follow the science” it does not take you to “open our schools.” If that morally doomed infant you spawned was old enough to attend school you know damn well you’d keep it home. See
NONE	#SaveOurSchools Really? Then why are the schools are not spending their everyyear's multi crores profit as a salary to their teachers. Don't make people fool by playing psychological propaganda in the name of student &amp; teachers by trending
FAVOR	@LgFski @BruceBourgoine So what? So what? Yeah, sure, what's a year in a child's life?   What will happen to the schools and teachers - the entire communities, for that matter?  And oh yeah, not one person under 30 has dies because of #COVID19 #mepolitics
FAVOR	We must boycott our schools, and protest to have the schools shut down, due to coronavirus. It's not only threatening to us as students, but to our parents. PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THIS SITUATION ISN'T AS BAD AS IT SEEMS, YOU ARE DELUSIONAL AS FUCK!
FAVOR	@SMC_edu  still has classes while WHO declared Coronavirus a pandemic. What will it take to move classes off campus? The entire school has to be infected?
NONE	I support teachers #Covid_19

FAVOR	Why are we closing schools after a diagnosis of #COVID19? Surely by then the proverbial horse has bolted and they may have infected other students or teachers.?#COVID19Aus
AGAINST	@SenKamalaHarris School closings affect poor &amp; POC who can’t afford private schools, tutors &amp; daycare. If you care about education you should demand that schools open or give vouchers for daycare, tutors or private schools. Not all kids learn online not all parents can help.
FAVOR	I'm YOUTH Brigade we have not been paid at that time we risk our lives to make sure that for those schools open are safe for kids by sanitizing classes and kids before and after school, taking temp, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks #PayBrigades
AGAINST	@NYGovCuomo This is true which is why Politics shouldn't be involved. Too much govt involvemement destroys everything.  Democrats have totally politicized coronavirus even using students as pawns. All data shows children are not spreaders.
AGAINST	Democrats and the teachers' unions don't care about poor children.  What about all the disadvantaged children who need HS sports to pay their way? Kind of hard for them to succeed in sports when the schools are closed.
FAVOR	I really don’t like homeschooling the grandkids but I’ll do it in a heartbeat before I let trump sacrifice my grand babies for his re-election.
FAVOR	@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan, millionaire white Republican, has 3 kids: Liza Ryan, 18, Charles, 17, and Samuel Ryan, 15.  I wonder if he will be sending them to school in a few weeks. He’s made no statement condemning the decision by his party to reopen schools. #GOPkids #notmykid
FAVOR	@aging_collins @donwinslow No, its a really simple visual demonstrating that our children and families are at risks. None of the people advocating for schools opening have children who will be impacted by this. Trump, DeVos, Pence...
AGAINST	If grocery stores can be open and people can risk their lives working there, then so can the schools and teachers.
FAVOR	@donwinslow @MeidasTouch So #TrumpKillsAmericans says Abortion is bad because it kills a child... But sending them to school during #COVID19 is OK??  #SMH #TrumpDoesntCare

FAVOR	All I’mma say to the North Carolina school district....if the #coronavirus  hits NC, students should have to right to stay out of school and #HBCUs shouldn’t expect for us to come to school if the outbreak hits colleges and universities
FAVOR	The #Trump Administration won't do anything about guns in schools, what makes you think they give a crap if your kids get the #Coronavirus?
FAVOR	All the educated people are supporting #OnlineEducation under these circumstances. The ones who are opposing it only shows how illiterate they are. Not their fault, they didn’t get good schools. And the same will happen if kids today don’t get quality education.
NONE	Its not a big deal if one year schools don't charge fees.  Its ok if students don't study for a year  Its ok if parents want to save on that money and enjoy vacation at home for a year.   This is exactly why we need EDUCATION.  Leads us from darkness to light
AGAINST	During these testing times Gujarat government should support schools that are finding new ways to bring normalcy in the lives of the school going children. #SaveOurSchools #mychildmychoice  @PMOIndia @narendramodi @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj
FAVOR	Schools close for an inch of snow or when flu season keeps a lot of students at home sick, but they want to remain open until a confirmed COVID-19 case pops up in the building? It looks like the schools need to be educated. :face_with_rolling_eyes::rage:
AGAINST	All you hoax believers can send your children back to a COVID-19 incubator, but
FAVOR	Social distancing in a classroom would require a room the size of a football field and no playtime. @ScottMorrisonMP, why do you insist on putting my wife (teacher) at risk??? #coronavirus
FAVOR	@RichieMcGinniss @JackPosobiec Look at how young they all are.  No wonder they don’t want schools to reopen.  These kids would have to be in class. @realDonaldTrump   Also, I don’t think this is 6’ social distancing.  Anyone got CV #s in this city?

FAVOR	@JessedHagopian @shaunking @brothajitu @democracynow The decisions to open schools are being made by over paid people  who don't enter schools, while on remote Zoom meetings!
FAVOR	Everyone is so "Pro-Life" until parents just want to keep their children safe during a pandemic and government officials demand we re-open schools. Tell me, is it a "return to normalcy" to sacrifice children to COVID-19? None of my own, but...

NONE	@JoeNBC Yet 24/7 we can count on @JoeNBC to deliver #DoomAndGloom from a Democrat Activist view. There are more deaths WW from flu than Covid. #OpenAmerica and
FAVOR	@evanmcmurry We can open the schools when we beat the virus- actually do the required close downs and impose 14 days no new cases... the longer we put this off the worse the economic collapse! Ridiculous!
AGAINST	#SaveOurSchools How can we become a global leader if we are forced to stop  learning abruptly? Let Schools function.
FAVOR	@hartfordcourant Reopening schools in a few weeks... will teachers be eligible for workers’ comp when COVID infects us? I’m heading back in a few weeks with protections like “recommended distancing when possible”. Who will sub for sick teachers? This is crazy. #NotMyKid
FAVOR	As a teacher i really dont like the fact that parliament is closed and we are expected to go to school and  be exposed to dangers of covid-19 everyday. This is like sending your chicken to the dogs, while u watch the show and relax:lying_face::lying_face:

FAVOR	@DrEricDing So basically, temperature screenings are not enough. Asymptomatic spread.  :mask:  #coronavirus #COVID19  #schoolsreopening
FAVOR	NYC public schools are like the cockroaches of the corona virus. While everything else shuts down, they'll be the only ones standing &amp; open. I get why it's a hard call but at least cancel all school activities so my kid doesn't have to be there for 12 hrs a day
NONE	Most are invested in thinking about continued learning for children. But for that to happen, schools must be able to collect what it rightfully due to them and pay their teachers and help them continue skilling up. They need as teachers to continue
NONE	“At the same time, one of the few things we know about the coronavirus with any degree of certainty is that the risk of contracting it diminishes outside — a review of 7,000 cases in China recorded only one instance of fresh-air transmission.” #OpenFCPS
FAVOR	@kromagin @cbigg81 @DinosaurJaime @OliviaNiland People on the side of keeping kids out of school for another year are harming children far, far more than opening schools would regarding this virus.  I’m beginning to think those teachers don’t really like teaching and shouldn’t be teaching.
AGAINST	#Covid19 killed 58 children under age 18. most are asymptomatic.  in 2017-18, the seasonal flu killed 188 children in the same age bracket. if they want to rely on data to open schools, I'm all for it. seems like a slam dunk to me.
FAVOR	@AprilDRyan I have no children but am friends with numerous teachers and librarians. Although they desperately want to return to schools, they don't think returning now will do anyone ANY favors. They are also outraged that the fed did NOTHING to stop or plan for this.
FAVOR	If #NYCSchools reopen before #COVID19 is under control, then assuming the .1% fatality rate is correct for children, ages 4-18, then the death rate of students in #NYC will be 1,127 (rounded) based on current enrollment.  #Coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic

AGAINST	#keepyourchildhome... why? Unless they have a pre-existing condition (MOST understandable), their mortality rate rounds down to ZERO %.   "Oh, but they could become carriers!" Then... wear your mask, right? Social distance, right?   I smell BS.
NONE	Why does ut matteruf schools get defudnded if they dont open. 1. If they aren't open they arent gonna be spending money on shit anyway. 2. People don't learn anything at s hool anyway either, except how to cheat and lie. They can look up shit on their phones.

NONE	Can we stop our Nation from development when we know that Private Schools are grooming 50% of our students in India @CSF_India  Why is the Nation quiet on #Gujarat stopping Private Unaided schools from charging fees
AGAINST	Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker as well as Massachusetts State Democrats are trying to get Fed funding for daycare. Now if they can open daycares they surely can open schools. I believe coronavirus doesn't discriminate between toddlers n school-age children.
NONE	@FOXLA @Newzysteph Well....this will be a true scientific experiment, with OC kids as the pawns.
AGAINST	There is ZERO science that indicates it’s not safe to re open schools.
FAVOR	waiting until we have the first case of Covid-19 in the @NYCSchools is the height of stupidity! @NYCMayor should close the schools now, before anyone tests positive and spreads it through their school and on the buses/subways.  #CoronavirusOutbreak
AGAINST	As the risk of COVID-19 is getting lower and lower , school should reopen with proper SOPs.
FAVOR	The Stubbornness from the @DBE_SA is out of this world...scientific evidence is there, Covid-19 is on its peak now, they waiting for those graves to be filled first then act?
FAVOR	*whispers* The @GOP isn't trying to win @realDonaldTrump votes by sending your kids back to school with no #COVID19 plan, they're trying to destroy public education by bankrupting and breaking the system by sending it into total chaos when half or more don't show up
FAVOR	TAKE YOUR KIDS OFF THE FUCKING SCHOOLS! #COVID2019 #coronavirus #workingfromhome #StayTheFHome
FAVOR	we gotta go back to school, i bet once they start pushing kids back to school, there will be a massive increase in cases. Kinda sad how they still don’t realize we are in the middle of a pandemic where cases are still rising erryday. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	so british schools will shut down after 2cm of snow but not for the coronavirus which is otherwise going to affect 70% of our population at least? makes sense
AGAINST	Should schools reopen this fall?

FAVOR	@liloakers @AliciaG19789176 @ThePantherBlacL @PostPunkBarbie @ThisCrazyLife3 @DHSCgovuk It seems the whole world is social distancing other than schools in the #UK. You couldn't make it up.

NONE	Let's get united to support schools and teachers!
FAVOR	"Schools will now be the experiment," Carroll says. "We're going to see a bunch of schools open with varying levels of control, and then we will see what happens." See what happens? Our children dying is not an experiment.!
FAVOR	@GovParsonMO do NOT OPEN SCHOOLS!! Do Something right . Please! #missouri #kcmo @MayorLucasKC help.
FAVOR	@JoshuaPotash @thegoodgodabove The way we'll know if @GOP really thinks it will be safe to go back to classrooms will be if they gut OSHA provisions for Workers Compensation if employees contract work related COVID19 illnesses. That would be a strike-worthy issue. #coronavirus
NONE	I’m just waiting for Trump to repurpose one of his old gems for the current national crisis: “I like people who weren’t deathly ill with a highly infectious disease.” #TrumpFailedAmerica #WearAMask #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie #COVID19 #FlunkTrump
FAVOR	@WJReid3 It’s crazy that @NYGovCuomo &amp; @NYCMayor aren’t taking action. They must want the #coronavirus to spread. That’s the only reason to not
FAVOR	Teachers to teach our kids.  They protect them from active shooters.  Now we're asking them to risk their lives/health to free us up to go to work?  Completely crazy.  All teachers should quit if their county forces them to teach in-person. #SchoolReopening
NONE	If the US would’ve had a nationwide lockdown to begin with by now we would’ve gone back to our lives and we wouldn’t have to be worrying about whether kids should go back to school or not.
AGAINST	Let schools proceed akere kids are stronger
NONE	Someone at work's son is really ill, she says it's all the symptoms of coronavirus but because he gets ill a lot she's not doing anything about it :sob:
FAVOR	There is no reason to fail our kids like this. They are pushing for schools to open in the name of the economy &amp; because they literally have no plan for anything else despite having months to plan. There is no reason any children or staff need die, #NotOneChild
AGAINST	@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Save our children - open our schools. #charter
FAVOR	C’mon Governors!  Don’t let DJT dictate and threaten you! Get your heads together and refuse to open schools at this time.  What? Is he going to cut off school funding to half the country? That is not how one wins an election!
FAVOR	I didn’t realize DT maliciously hid the CDC recommendationthat NO SCHOOLS should open. How can anyone in education ignore experts? Hoping school districts send a clear message to politicians NOT to play politics w/our children. This is not a good experiment.
FAVOR	@GaHospitalAssoc @GaDPH @GovKemp Better yet #StayHomeSaveLives #ShutGADown
FAVOR	I don’t care about the coronavirus I just want to get out of this my dumbass school lmao
FAVOR	The Pharma Executives testifying about the "vaccine" live = They have said that they are concerned about sending children back, even after the vax, because we don't know the Pediatric implications yet. - BIG PHARMA IS WORRIED. Let that sink in for a sec. #COVID19
FAVOR	I just don't understand why schools are opening and the outbreak is getting worse.
FAVOR	I legit asked the teacher what happens if we got the Corona virus, she said they would close it down for one day and disinfect it and then we would come back the next day. Honestly I’m not going to school if it gets here f that!
FAVOR	Insults were hurled at @MmusiMaimane and we were cyber-bullied for supporting the call for schools not to reopen under unsafe conditions. Y'all are a confused bunch. Honestly.
AGAINST	Open schools , colleges and universities . We should stand with teachers. #StandWithTeachers
FAVOR	@nowthisnews How do these ppl sleep at night? Their audacity to callously ignore the extreme dangers they’re putting not just our kids in  is just beyond...We all want schools to re-open but NOT in the middle of a pandemic. Control the cases FIRST then talk abt schools.
FAVOR	Riddle me this...the government has been so hell bent on vaccinations not allowing kids to attend school until they’re updated..we don’t even have a fucking vaccine for COVID so why does this moron and his negligent administration want to reopen schools??
AGAINST	We will surely save our schools.
FAVOR	Are we going to allow our kids to be vectors of the #coronavirus and pass it to Grandma and grandpa?  Don't hate the elderly.
FAVOR	Everyone is worried for the students but don’t forget about teachers too! Most teachers are of an older age which leaves them more vulnerable to COVID-19
FAVOR	So the administration should lead by example, @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls children should be the first to go back to brick &amp; mortar schools to lead the way. When we see you following the mandate then we’ll talk.
AGAINST	Dear @GavinNewsom , what exactly is the #science behind your decision to unilaterally shut down schools? That's what's supposed to drive your response, right? #antiscience
FAVOR	@mdnij34 Don't do it. Zero leadership, a rampant spreading virus. I don't see how any school can safely open now until there's a vaccine.
FAVOR	@SRuhle just now a horrible story abt 82 kids contracting #COVID__19 at camp, despite all the precautions and being sent back home to 10 dif states, weaponising children to spread #COVID__19 , go ahead open schools

FAVOR	@NBCLA Im scared to go to school #LAUSD needs to stop being money greedy they aren’t thinking of those kids who have low immune system and who can easily catch the #coronavirus and spread it
FAVOR	@CBSNews Send your kids to public schools first.
FAVOR	I guess my school thinks that there are too many students. So they aren’t canceling school, and allowing like 3000 kids who shove their fingers in each others mouths to come and wipe their grubby ass hands all over the building. Imma stay home #coronavirus
NONE	The collaboration of teachers and parents is appreciable as they both maximise their capabilities to keep the young learners engaged to bring back normalcy in their academic routine.Teachers need a fair justice for their undying efforts during the lockdown period.
AGAINST	@TerryAdirimMD @JosephSakran @drchethansathya @dbongino Why are they opening schools in Europe without any outbreaks?
FAVOR	@donwinslow No Vaccine - No school, that has always been the policy, correct?? This is a deadly pandemic, not a reality show!!  I have already told our school district that my children will not be returning to the classroom!!
AGAINST	@LJ4fcps schools should be opened in the fall.
FAVOR	Governor @GovRonDeSantis , why aren’t your offices open? If you want all schools open in a month, open your offices today. #COVID19
NONE	@BetsyDeVosED @VP you are awful! please stay out of education and our schools.
AGAINST	If the US is so Pro-Life and cares about innocent babies, then why the fuck are trump and DeVos so hellbent on sending our kids to their doom at COVID filled schools?
FAVOR	@PTI_News The Schools n colleges should be closed pan India,  for at least a fortnight owing to the threat of coronavirus. Else We would be putting a lot lives under threat. Do not want an Italy like response #COVID19india
FAVOR	If my ass has fucking asthma and if some dumb bitch in my school gets the corona virus and I end up getting it I’m gonna end up fucking dying

NONE	The British government has FINALLY taken decisive action to combat the spread of coronavirus  Boris Johnson is now advising we should wash our hands . . . For 30 seconds!  The delay phase has begun. Shit just got real!
NONE	#7 “We’re all going to get the coronavirus eventually, so what’s the difference?” :bulb:Mortality will be much higher if millions get it all at once, before health systems have the time to build up capacity to respond.
AGAINST	@Traderlebowski @katrinagulliver @BenAltitude @JoeSilverman7 Dude, how do teachers get paid?  Here is a clue,  property taxes.  Teachers are no better than nurses,  doctors,  police,  cashiers,  bank tellers,  and so on. Teachers needs to get back to work. Wear a damn mask.
AGAINST	@GovTimWalz Your indecision on masks is irresponsible.   Opening schools should be a priority.  Requiring masks of all in all public spaces helps create safer conditions to open schools. #maskup
NONE	Hey @CLE_State, does Harlan have his head....in the Sands??? :eyes::eyes: I’ll see myself out :joy::joy: @CSU_President #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #ohio #schoolclosure
NONE	@nick_ramsey can't she just email the binder out to everyone and skip the propaganda sessions?  #PropagandaBarbie #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirus #ETTD
AGAINST	@ParrishBrenton Vulnerable stay home, but you don’t make all students suffer for a few.   Under your analogy, then, the 90k who died in 2017 weren’t worth shutting the schools down?  We all know that students are still socializing, protesting and not staying in their homes 24/7.
FAVOR	The Trump Cult can send their children to school because obviously they are not to smart, but SMART Americans are NOT sending our children to the SUPER SPREADER schools. Absolutely RIDICULOUS for politicians to expect this while the virus is out of control!!!
AGAINST	My question to South Africa is....till when are you going to sit at home and wait for things to go back to normal,what if things never go back to normal,what if the vaccine takes 10 years to reach you,think about that too.
FAVOR	@MarilynTatman You're so right. In Europe we're looking how to organise alternated classes (half), 1way paths, alternated meals. Big issue: cleaning everything in between! Masks compulsory. Easier with elder kids. Online teaching enhances social  groups, so not the only solution.
FAVOR	I’m so done with people crying: “No mandates, let people be socially responsible bc freedom!”  But also crying: “What do you mean we shouldn’t open schools bc no one wore masks or stayed at home!” #COVID19 #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS #Covidiocy #schoolsreopening
AGAINST	All parents are not trained to be teachers. We need the daily structure that our school and teachers provide in order to help our children. We can assist but can’t replace. Let schools function #SaveOurSchools #RightToTeach @imBhupendrasinh @hrdministry
FAVOR	Who is Angie Motshega if @WHO has said it is not safe for schools to reopen during the spike of the pandemic. Parents let's not take our kids to schools WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT
FAVOR	People who don’t understand accountability, think they can never do the wrong thing. Be accountable, do right for our kids, teachers and schools
AGAINST	@aebrennen So true. Your teachers need to focus on what they need to do to get ready for the fall semester. Teachers are planning right now. Let them know what the expectation will be. Online learning is a temporary situation. #SchoolReopening
FAVOR	@csheets44 @GovMikeDeWine My daughter goes to Dayton public schools and last year she had to sit in science class with no teacher the entire year. They gave them a packet and left them alone for the day. How will this year look??? This is going to be a disaster. SMH
NONE	So finally people start to realize that Coronavirus isn’t a joke
FAVOR	I don’t even HAVE a child, and I understand that is imperative we keep schools closed until it is safe for students, teachera and staff. This shouldn’t be hard to grasp.
AGAINST	@TexasTribune Even if it's ridiculous &amp; unnecessary? Even if it causes our students to fall behind, be at greater risk for child abuse, &amp; causes parents to lose their livelyhoods because they are unable to work? Closing schools is disgraceful &amp; history will not treat you kindly.
AGAINST	During these testing times Gujarat government should support schools that are finding new ways to bring normalcy in the lives of the school going children.
FAVOR	I don’t get why we are waiting for coronavirus to get to our campuses before closing them. The spread will be much worse when it reaches the campus so closing before that can happen is the only logical way to combat it
FAVOR	Our teachers aren't covid bouncers. These must happen: 1. Getting real PPEs' used by front line staff in hospitals not just the sanitizers and only two masks. What nonsense is that. 2. DBE should insure that classrooms have correct ventilation
AGAINST	@Gagan2627 Let's be careful what we wish for. If govt schools were working fine, India would not have needed private schools. School owners pay teachers, rentals &amp; other expenses from the fee that parents pay. With FRC, anyways, there is control on fee. What more is needed?
NONE	Now Providing Professional Antiviral Sanitization or Disinfecting services for Schools, Public &amp; Private Sectors: Contact 0738373828 (Whatsapp) / 0725587611
FAVOR	Isn’t it funny how people who do not have children in public schools all want schools to open? It’s like men telling women what to do with their bodies. Whoever insists on opening schools  need to spend a week its the kids. Good luck #IfSchoolsReopenNow
AGAINST	Think back to your childhood and think about the role teachers have had in who you are now as an adult. By shutting down schools, you’re effectively taking away the livelihood of those very same teachers.
NONE	The plight of these schools and their staff members must be heard and resolved by the government.
AGAINST	How about equipping school districts deploy Food Truck Schools to their streets....Lunch and Learns .... Canopied open air with heat columns...ancient Greek lyceums refreshed. Nutrition boosted...real private sector and whole government effort....
AGAINST	Oh, boy! Praying for my daughter and her 2021 classmates! Looks like they will be robbed of a normal Senior year thanks to #COVID19 restrictions that are totally unnecessary! Stop this insanity!
FAVOR	I dont wanna go to school. FUCK
FAVOR	@GOP @realDonaldTrump Opening schools in hotspots will force these children to kill their parents and grandparents. #Trump and the #GOP will have blood on their hands.
AGAINST	Nywe nywe Kenya closed schools for the entire year. The last time I checked this is SA. Our lives can’t be dictated by what our neighbors do. Why don’t you move to Kenya niyeke ukusingxolela
NONE	@Debber66 @DineshDSouza The #COVID19 is intelligent and will not dare to reproduce here! #FauciLiedPeopleDied
NONE	@libertythePD @PattyArquette @CBSLA Yes, hold the OCBE accountable for passing the DANGEROUS &amp; IRRESPONSIBLE “White Paper!” Don’t let them dismiss what they’ve done! Documents have real power when they come from a sitting committee vested w/authority by the people. #Resist
FAVOR	@MercerYou I could not be more disappointed. As a public health professional taking night classes your decision to remain open in a serious pandemic puts me and everyone else at great risk. You should be ashamed!! #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #PublicHealth
AGAINST	So there is no #Covid_19 in Private schools?
NONE	How can we let science lead the way for opening schools in the Fall when there isn’t one ‘scientific’ approach to dealing with COVID-19? #Covid_19
FAVOR	What’s wrong with the corona virus. People are stocking up for an apocalypse and it’s stupid. Calm down, it’s literally a worse real story flu and why are people having a seizure over this. I’m acting like it doesn’t exist. But close the schools please
AGAINST	@JRubinBlogger He doesn’t want to kill any kids. :woman_facepalming: Using your misguided logic KIDS can NEVER go back to school until they ERADICATE the FLU!! The Flu is more deadly to kids than the Coronavirus!
FAVOR	@HillaryClinton And parents shouldn't be forced to choose between their kids lives and Trump’s hopes to get re-elected. @realDonaldTrump
FAVOR	@mosalty @UFT @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @DistCouncil37 @FollowCSA @SenSchumer @AFTunion The entire premise is wrong. There is NO way to teach in full PPE. There is NO way kids keep masks on for 7 hours. Has anyone talking about these things EVER stepped foot inside a classroom to teach??
FAVOR	Kenyan Education Minister recently announced that schools in kenya will remain closed until 2021. And yet in SA we have people like #angiemotshekga who think SA schoolkids are exempted from succumbing to the virus.
FAVOR	I've made a big discussion today and that my 3 children will not be going back to school until the #coronavirus is under control or there is a vaccination for it....
AGAINST	This group representing 67,000 pediatricians believe it’s okay for your child to return to school.   The death rate is .36% under age 65.  Under age 20, and the death rate is almost non-existent. The flu is deadlier to your child than coronavirus.
FAVOR	They shouldn't open the school.. keep it online and donate some laptops and some wifi.
AGAINST	Keeping schools closed is a big sell out to all working moms who now have to pick up homeschooling  I thought leftists were in favour of woman? @TheDemocrats didn't think that one through.
AGAINST	@MiamiSup I'm a parent and tax payer &amp; expect a choice as to how my tax dollars are spent. I expect the option for in person learning, specially after the CDC Directors put forth recommendation for all schools to open.
FAVOR	@richardmarx It makes 0 sense that we send kids back to school when we still need to mask up and distance everywhere else.
NONE	@NPR You call them Face Coverings? What happened to masks?  Or better, muzzle   Georgians have common sense and know when it matters to mask up.    @GovKemp knows that.        We do not need @KeishaBottoms dictatorial actions and #coronavirus showboat politics.  And
FAVOR	Cuny isn’t closing schools but telling students to wash their hands that’s how they are gonna prevent corona virus  :woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone::woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone::woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone:
FAVOR	It is a true travesty that we cannot rely on our government for accurate information during a pandemic. How are people suppose to make educated decisions?  Trump is creating even more angry mothers &amp; fathers #notmykid #BlueWave #HeroesAct #COVID19 #TrumpFailedAmerica
AGAINST	If #daycare centers can be open during the #pandemic, why can't #schools My 2yo has been going to daycare the whole year, he never stopped.  No illnesses in the kids or teachers. So why not schools?!?
AGAINST	@TimRunsHisMouth Parents in LA need to enroll their kids in charter &amp; private schools now and tell the LATU to stuff it! #LATU clearly hates children if they want to take away a family's choice of which school is best for their child. Unionless schools with merit pay all the way!
NONE	Just a quick update to my U.S. followers, I'll be making a stop in all 50 states this spring!  No tickets needed, just don't wash your hands, cough on each other, etc!  #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak
FAVOR	Dear Trump, DeVos and all #MAGA pushing to reopen schools before it is safe,  If are Federal government had taken this pandemic seriously and acted accordingly it would be safe to reopen schools this fall. But they didn't, so it's not.
FAVOR	@DNCWarRoom @IMontoyaResists There is no way my 3 kids are physically going back to school in the Fall. They all want to, but Trump has purposefully bungled our response to Covid so badly schools can't reasonably be made safe right now.
NONE	Schools are doing their best to ensure that  education for children is not disrupted. I support my children's school and all self financed schools wholeheartedly.
FAVOR	Cancelling public events and social gatherings...Amazing! But schools are still open for 100s of people to mix 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. I’m no expert but...#coronavirus #COVID19 #coronavirusuk
FAVOR	Schools must shutdown I'm not sending my child to school
FAVOR	@thomaskaine5 Vaccine first.  #notmykid
FAVOR	@joshi_speaks @zoneanthony @anubha1812 For underprivileged government is offering free education, take for one year and when the situation changes shift back to private schools. Also can talk to school and ask for more instalments for payment of fees. Every school is ready to offer monthly instalment
AGAINST	Y’all want schools to shutdown but your kids are all over the streets with no masks :unamused:
NONE	@thehill @mcspocky Americans who lost their lives, due to Trump's maladministration of #covid19, over 134,000.  This did not need to happen, America is one of the richest countries in the world, BUT we have an Inept POTUS, and his entire administration grossly neglecting U.S.
FAVOR	Can things get dumber in NYC? Mayor De blasio says Child care will be provided for up to 80,000 kids when schools closed this Fall. Where will this take place you ask??? In the schools. You just can’t dream this crap up LOL. :joy: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  #NYC
FAVOR	@donwinslow Thank you for creating such a poignant reminder that children should not bear consequences of adult failures.  #COVID19 is more of a threat than it was in March when schools closed.  For now
NONE	To prevent #Economiccollapse  #economiccrisis during #CoronavirusPandemic govt shud get banks 2help biz’s by postponing EMI’s n giving discounts in interest charged. Dis small step wud ensure businesses keep paying salaries #COVID #coronavirusinindia #Coronavid19

FAVOR	Cancels #GOP convention but wants schools reopened! Conservatives are only saving themselves! #TrumpVirus #GestapoTrump
NONE	And the COO of the board said “The science isn’t clear on masks.”  I came in hot with — Are you kidding me?!? Masks work, science proves it and other countries are better off then the US because of masks.
FAVOR	Every school in the area has cancelled classes or went online while @WWU is just waiting until AFTER we have a COVID-19 case when it’s very clear we have multiple on campus. We have students who actually work at these nursing homes which are at VERY HIGH risk.
FAVOR	@w_terrence This is better... @pantomath__ The U.S. saw its highest single day of new COVID-19 cases today, with 71,135 cases reported.   And Trump is concerned about Reopening schools
AGAINST	@DanCrenshawTX Schools need to reopen. The science shows children who do contract Covid do not become ill like adults and they do not pass it.
FAVOR	We would all feel very different about schools reopening if we had a goverment that: -Was trustworthy -Had best interest of children as only motivation  -Based on Science  -provided necessary resources to ALL schools -had a National plan   None of these is true
AGAINST	@pr0mode I'm thinking that if kids going into college thing that 15% of $8,000 is about $300.00 that we really need school choice and to open up schools now.  #SchoolChoice
NONE	The govt of Dubai reached out to schools and asked them to share best practices of online teaching. The inspectors are visiting schools, watching live sessions and formulating best practices. Instead, your order will close down schools in Gujarat @imBhupendrasinh
FAVOR	@BorisEP @JoeBiden This footage was filmed during the last week. This is @realDonaldTrump America and it is terrifying. I’m not facing the #TrumpsGestapo but I am facing @CherokeeSchools opening with no face mask requirement or social distancing plan. #TrumpVirus
FAVOR	Quoting Sadhguru, edited for this context - "No one is expecting Online Education to be perfect, but Schools are constantly striving to be better; in the best way possible under these circumstances to bridge the GAP in learning. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS."
NONE	Now that the CDC isn't overseeing the covid-19 numbers, next week they'll be "absolutely, perfectly low".. Something no other country has ever done :face_with_rolling_eyes::face_with_rolling_eyes:

NONE	doing my college a solid just emailed in saying i’ve self isolated and only had corona virus for like 7-8 days now so should be ok :blush: don’t thank me yet #COVID2019uk
FAVOR	@W7VOA @GOPconvention Children over age 10 have been shown to transmit the virus at the same rate as adults.   There are a whole lot of kids age 10-18 that are going to carry the disease all through their schools and out into the communities. #GOPDeathCult
FAVOR	Teachers are taking our  schools to students' homes.
FAVOR	@donwinslow Even though my 4 kids are adults, our oldest is a teacher. There is absolutely no guidance in place now. Schools open in less than a month. I worry about her and her students.
FAVOR	@HoarseWisperer Laura Ingraham has 3 school-age children: Maria, 15, Michael, 12, &amp; Nikolai, 10. Ingraham has not told anyone if her kids will be staying home. (Ingraham works at home due to coronavirus.)  Don’t you want to know her plans for her own children? #GOPkids #NotMyKid
NONE	Dont u think Staff Selection Commision should postpone its upcoming exams due to coronavirus ?  #COVID19  #postponeAllExams  #postponeSSCexams #CoronaAlert #CoronaKoDhona
FAVOR	@piersmorgan Not enough I fear.  Gov prefers to be reactive, rather than proactive Now COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic I think we should close the schools to help slow the spread of infection. We’re in a better position to do it than other countries. So we should do so.
NONE	Schools are not hotels- pay when u stay. Education makes your kids life.  Fees need to be paid. What about teachers salaries? #CMOGujrat #PMOIndia
FAVOR	The UK government tried to reopen schools and the people of Scotland refused.
FAVOR	No audience at the upcoming Presidential debate this Sunday due to #COVID19 but it’s ok for kids to be in school just outside the country’s hotspot for the virus?#pandemic
NONE	I don't get why the ask us to wash our hands before the clean our school. We deserve a clean school. Start a petition for all I care but keep our school clean because when one of us gets Coronavirus they are gonna get on us for not washing our hands.
FAVOR	My children rarely go out - if they catch Coronavirus it will be from school and I will not be happy if I’m honest - my middle boy has asthma so I am worried for him :tired_face:
NONE	Education is a fundamental right &amp; not a subject of votebank. Parents&amp;schools should stay united &amp; stop getting influencEd by political dramas. Its my choice to select  best for my child.  Every good thing comes with a cost &amp; if I want best I  should pay for it
FAVOR	What's more important? A students education? Or the wellness of the student and staff? Closing schools for a day may work for bad weather, but not for the coronavirus. Districts all around need to open their eyes and realize one day closures do nothing to help!
FAVOR	@NahasNewman Thank you for this!As a teacher, I have been looking at a little of this data, but I haven't seen this much all together.The schools here are planning on opening in some capacity and this data helps me with any fears I might have had.I'll definitely be passing it on
FAVOR	@PressSec Show us the science that children and staff are not in harm's way if schools open.&lt; All of it, as I know you hate cherry picked data.&gt;   Cases are skyrocketing. Schools are *not* daycares.
FAVOR	@JohnCornyn And what exactly are you doing to make schools any safer, Senator?  Teachers and students need PPEs and testing.  Most school don’t have nurses or even money for sanitizers and tissues. You want all kids going back to school without safeguards?
NONE	@SnehalSolanki09 @PMOIndia @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp @CMOGuj Govt has not answer to Pay Salaries to teachers and schools have collected fees for years and also can collect fees once school opens. Aren't parents not Human? Parents are facing stress, business losses, job loss etc. Why can't school support Parents for a Year!!
FAVOR	-thats the end of it. I'm not risking my grandparents lives over your own greedy needs. you're supposed to keep us SAFE, not put us out in HARM. we are not your puppets for you to throw around and pick up whenever you need something. KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED.
NONE	Did I tell you that the number of new deaths in Pima county the county where Tucson is located the second largest city in Arizona.  Had ZERO deaths reported for coronavirus again today.     Zero  #CoronaVirus #COVID__19 #ArizonaCovid19
AGAINST	@FoxNewsSunday @BetsyDeVosED How ironic that the same people pretending to care about child education also want schools to stay closed and block any attempt to reform with #SchoolChoiceNow. The silver lining of quarantine may be a renewed interest in #Homeschooling which Biden WILL block!!
AGAINST	The way everyone is waiting for University, college and schools to be closed because of coronavirus :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::skull::skull:
FAVOR	Obviously opening schools as usual all across the country is insane and dangerous. However, if you are screaming about closing schools without demanding a solution for parents suddenly without childcare then you do not actually care about parents or children
FAVOR	@SnehalSolanki09 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @imBhupendrasinh @vijayrupanibjp Govt is very irresponsible towards school teachers we have not got salary from last five months, its okay you can't open schools that too due to your irresponsible behaviour towards covid 19 but govt should also support private tutors of schools and coachings
