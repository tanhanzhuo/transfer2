1.1	The bathtub like background is thin and in the case of my unit very easily bent, thus the apparent return as it was dented all along the top, but the background is so tall the dents have not been an issue for any of the photos I've taken.
0.6	so some of the details are lost.
1.4	My 1st grader loves this show and plays endlessly with this toy.

1.2	I still give it 4 stars because I learned a lot about WWI even though it was painful reading.
0.8	It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose:
0.7	So far Ariana has done a masterful tightrope between the two genres, but she slips up here.
0.6	and we all know if you wanted rhymes
0.4	I was given this product in exchange for an honest review.
1.6	Definitely a game for all ages!!
1.2	Van is a true original, and if `Moondance' were his only career recording he would still win entry to the Hall of Fame.

1.5	, my homemade hoverman got one more channel, so i returned it, full money back, if this unit is 20 or 30 bucks, i would give it a four star and potentially keep it, but a homemade hoverman, without reflector, got one more channe?

1.6	I do know that having that comparison on your first album is an accomplishment.
1.3	only negative of the DVD is it is only available in full frame.

0.8	Got this as a Christmas gift.
1	Don't know why others found it unappealing.
1.6	The only drawback with the set is the quality control on the box.
1.3	so you will still need real Lego sets for those kinds of pieces, although they do include roof pieces.

1.1	Another critique is that binder itself is too small if your are going to be adding your own resources.
1.4	A bonus for me is that each segment you can do seperately.

1.1	It's been great when I didn't want a honking speedlite on my cameraI've
0.9	If the players do not cooperate or make random moves then they will lose.

1.4	I'm not sure why it took me so long to discover this album, but I'm glad I finally did.
1.7	It comes with plenty of toppings so that you can use all the same, or realistically, still have plenty of extra toppings when a few get lost.
1.5	The only damage was that the side became bent, but other than that, nothing...and the shots came out as good as ever...

1.4	very happy i purchase this.
1.5	Absolutely great for the money.
1.6	The main character's alcoholism is too sad to be funny, the plot unravels in a way that's too formulaic to be taken seriously, and the Sci-Fi is so boring that it's Z-grade.

0.8	Great to be able to move the Mondo to other rooms.

0.8	The dark intro to the band.
1.8	It is a wonderful CD to listen to, unintrusive and pleasant.
1.8	The writer is an experienced professional in his field and particularly this book helps one to be motivated, enthusiastic in anything she does and develop confidence.
1.4	i could not be any more happy with this set of earphones
1.1	Much smallet than anticipated, though the description does say tiny....
2	This thing has truly helped us to stay on track with a schedule and has help remind us of little details we need to know during our planning.
1.6	Most aesthetically pleasing part is the lack of the little modle on the wire that you would normall have a mic and volume control.
1.2	Ear piece too soft and flimsy.
1.6	The book provides you with questions to ask all you vendors to ensure you are getting the best for your big day!!
1.7	This in turn, makes his growth in the film all the more satisfying.
1.2	only have an EF-S wide-angle lens to compare to, and its obviously worse.
1.5	Great for goody bags at a kids party and for anything else.
2	With their superior strength and durability, excellent noise isolation, distortion-free volume levels and deep base, SymphonizedTM headphones are perfect for iPhones, iPods and iPads, mp3 players, CD players and more.
1.5	Saturn's ring falls off any chance it gets, and the planetarium feature which is what I really got this for lacks the ability to see the constellations clearly with it being too close to one wall, far from another and blurry on the ceiling.
1.6	I was very impressed with Jaden Smith & all the hard work he put into this movie, with the help of Jackie Chan.
1.3	Did not last 2 weeks and they blew.

1.1	are some roller tree bubbles and some old gloves.
1.2	It is a spare arrangement that begins with the lovely expression
0.4	It is the ultimate form of power.
1.2	This  music reminds me of Donna Summer at  her best and I am sure that Summer  wished that she could have hooked up with these producers.
1.7	I wanted something compact, easy to use, and with quality video.
1.5	Many of these characters are members of the Order of the Phoenix, and because they serve as Easter eggs for the true fan and to supply depth to the universe of Harry Potter, reminding us that much more is going on beyond the halls of Hogwarts, these characters add rather than subtract from the film.
1.6	easy directions not too in detail tho or difficult to follow, but for beginners its a good general intro to bellydancing
1.7	didn't try analog connection yet because optical connection is very good, and much easier to use.
0.8	He opened for many of Tupac's rap shows and he also helped Biggie  out like brother would do.

1.6	Yes its one of the best lenses I have in my bag.
1	The only issue I've had is with cord noise, it's definitely on the loud side.

1	and I'm always satisfied.
1.9	This one is great and really shows how kids can feel when it is time to share.
1.7	I bought this as a gift and the receiver had this to say - "These headphones provide quality sound without completely shutting out the outside world.
1.2	For the first 20-30 minutes, "Hondo" seems like it just might transcend the "typical Duke western" label.
1.9	They sound great with any kind of music and my TV shows too.
1.1	I don't know why I was surprised, because Mr.Michael is brilliant, but I just love this album
1	In fact, all three are only distinguished by their overall tones.
0.8	Eventually drums and bass enter the growing crescendo of sound.
1.8	Sur wish the planets rotated and the orbital paths were a little more real--this would have helped during the "why are there seasons" lesson
1.5	The extra length allows my camera to actually sit on my lap when I have opportunity to sit down.

1.4	Got the job done and the price was right.
1.3	I think that's due to his heavy use of exposition in this novel, which created a clear need to humanize and flesh out his characters.
1.1	and I kept reading references to things and language that could only be the new century stuff,
0.7	Shortly after, Tupac moves in with a neighbor and begins selling drugs.
1.5	Needs regular adjusting, but that could be the terrible fitting iPod earphones (Earbuds possibly better)
0.9	Companies pay to be members and then as long as they respond in some manner to complaints (rather than flat-out ignoring them), it's very hard to knock down their "A" ratings.
1	Not awful, not awesome, just...
1.3	and I expect that in another year or two or after another 5-10 plays she will be able to play it easily.
1.3	]The book was delivered quickly but in good condition.
0.7	i would stay away from purchasing these online because they are fake and you get scammed.
1.1	It brings a whole new dimension to the immersion.
1	Well, after reading the book for some time now, he started sharing and started telling me "mama
1.6	Sounds great for the price.

1.6	I recommend it to everyone!
1.1	Used in the garden shed outside.
1.2	I use them primarily on long runs (5 miles or more ) and havn't had an issue yet.
1.7	Got it set up, radio worked great but the CD player was no good; which was the main reason I bought this.
1	and I picked up a few channels.
1.1	I love this particular DVD it might be might favorite.
0.4	he will be around for awhile.
1.5	I am  still giving this CD Five stars because i like that song and the other ones  on it.
1.8	There are many shades of every colour and the 'silly scents' make using these more fun.

1	While 'plotless' works are the epitome of the post-modern narritive structure (i.e. Seinfeild, Mark Leyner's work), Danieleski simulataniously embraces this technique and attempts to circumvent the ubiquitous question 'what was the point?'
1.5	The whole album really could belong in enother era which combines elements of Gypsy jazz, barrel house blues and some good old romantic balladry.
1.4	(2010)----------------------------------This is a pretty good remake of the 1984 kiddie classic, "The Karate Kid," featuring action hero Jackie Chan playing the part of  martial arts instructor Mr. Han, and Will Smith's son, Jaden, in the Ralph Macchio hero role.

0.7	On older Canon camera models
0.6	but then I guess it's a matter of taste
0.7	So you'll have $600,000 or $700,000 instead of $1,000,000 at retirement - big whoop!

0.6	Your Heart is as Black as Night," she only says when asked whether this song is about a failed romance, the other person lacked color in their heart.
