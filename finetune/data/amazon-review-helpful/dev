0.6	just do not want to miss that special shot.
1.3	It maintains its f 2.8 throughout the range.

0.6	Me Against The World - Very introspective4.
1.4	So, in a day when the music industry is passing out artificial, gold-plated awards for looking the best, sounding the best & then finally "falling" the best, it's good to know that the "still-small-voice" of true vocal talent, still humbly reigns in the hearts of many.
1	It was entertaining and kept my attention.
