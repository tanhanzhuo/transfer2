At the local ice cream shop by the name of Dolce, they have at least 20 different flavors of ice cream and Italian ice. They are oh so delicious. In the wintertime, we love to go sled riding at one of the local hills. The hill we go to is right next to the highway and is at least 50 feet high. Its one of the best hills around to go sled riding at!\n"}
